Number

Dependencies

    EGL 1.0 or later.

Overview

    EGL 1.1 supports three types of drawing surfaces:
      * Window surfaces
      * Pixmap surfaces
      * Pbuffer surfaces
    This extension defines a fourth type of drawing surface:
      * Screen surface

    A screen surface is a surface for which the (front) color buffer can
    be directly displayed (i.e. scanned out) on a monitor (such as a flat
    panel or CRT).  In particular the color buffer memory will be allocated
    at a location in VRAM (and in a suitable format) which can be displayed
    by the graphics hardware.

    Note that the width and height of the screen surface need not exactly
    match the monitor's current resolution.  For example, while the monitor
    may be configured to to show 1024x768 pixels, the associated screen
    surface may be larger, such as 1200x1000.  The "screen origin" attribute
    will specify which region of the screen surface which is visible on the
    monitor.  The screen surface can be scrolled by changing this origin.

    This extension also defines functions for controlling the monitor's
    display mode (width, height, refresh rate, etc), and specifying which
    screen surface is to be displayed on a monitor.

    The new EGLModeMESA type and related functions are very similar to the
    EGLConfig type and related functions.  The user may get a list of
    supported modes for a screen and specify the mode to be used when
    displaying a screen surface.


Issues

    1. Should EGL_INTERLACE be a supported mode attribute?

       Arguments against:

           No, this should be provided by another extension which would
           also provide the mechanisms needed to play back interlaced video
           material correctly on hardware that supports it.
           This extension should prefer non-interlaced modes. [M. Danzer]

       Arguments for:

           An interlaced display can be of use without considering video
           material.  Being able to query whether a screen is operating in
           interlaced mode can be used by applications to control their
           drawing.  For example: avoid drawing 1-pixel-wide horizontal lines
           if screen is interlaced. [B. Paul]

       Resolution: Defer for future extension?


    2. Should EGL_REFRESH_RATE be a supported mode attribute?

       Arguments for:

           Yes, it's been shown that applications and/or users need to select
           modes by this.  [M. Danzer]

           Many examples have been given in which it's desirable to let the
           user choose from a variety of refresh rates without having to
           restart/reconfigure.  [B. Paul]

       Arguments against:

           TBD.

       Resolution: Yes.


    3. Exactly how should the list of modes returned by eglChooseConfigMESA
       be sorted?

       Current method is described in the text below.  Subject to change.

       Alternately, leave the sorting order undefined so that each
       implementation can return the modes in order of "most desirable"
       to "least desirable" which may depend on the display technology
       (CRT vs LCD, etc) or other factors.


    4. How should screen blanking be supported?  Note that a screen can be
       disabled or turned off by calling eglShowSurface(dpy, scrn,
       EGL_NO_SURFACE, EGL_NO_MODE_MESA).  But what about power-save mode?

       I would defer this to other extensions that depend on this one.
       I can imagine people wanting different semantics not just in
       relation to the power management API being exposed (DPMS or whatever)
       but also relating to what events can trigger EGL_CONTEXT_LOST.  Also
       I'm not sure whether power management commands are properly operations
       on the Display or on a screen surface. [A. Jackson]


    5. Should the EGL_PHYSICAL_SIZE_EGL query be kept?  The size information
       isn't always reliable (consider video projectors) but can still be
       used to determine the pixel aspect ratio.

       Resolution: Omit.  The EGL 1.2 specification includes queries for
       the display resolution and pixel aspect ratio.


    6. Should detailed mode timing information be exposed by this API?

       Probably not.  Instead, offer that information in a layered extension.


    7. How should the notion of a screen's "native" mode be expressed?
       For example, LCD panels have a native resolution and refresh rate
       that looks best but other sub-optimal resolutions may be supported.

       The mode attribute EGL_OPTIMAL_MESA will be set for modes which
       best match the screen.  [M. Danzer]


    8. Should eglQueryModeStringMESA() be included?  This function returns
       a human-readable string which corresponds to an EGLMode.

       Arguments for:

           A mode name such as "HDTV-720P" might mean more to users than
           "1280x720@60Hz" if the later were generated via code.

       Arguments against:

           There's no standard syntax for the strings.  May cause more
           trouble than it's worth.

       Postpone for future extension. [A. Jackson]

       Latest discussion leaning toward omitting this function.


    9. Should we use "Get" or "Query" for functions which return state?
       The EGL 1.x specification doesn't seem to be totally consistent
       in this regard, but "Query" is used more often.

       Use "Get" for mode-related queries (as for EGLConfigs) but "Query"
       for everything else.


    10. What should be the default size for screen surfaces?

        For Pbuffer surfaces the default width and height are zero.
        We'll do the same for screen surfaces.  Since there's no function
        to resize surfaces it's useless to have a 0x0 screen, but this isn't
        a situation that'll normally be encountered.


    11. Should there be a function for resizing a screen surface?

        Suppose one wants to change the screen's size in the EGL application.
        Also suppose there's a hardware restriction such that only one screen
        surface can exist at a time (either for lack of memory or because of
        memory layout restrictions).

        The basic idea is that the currently displayed screen surface must
        be deallocated before a new one can be created.  Perhaps a resize
        function would work better?


    12. How should sub-pixel LCD color information be made available?
        What about the display's gamma value?

        Perhaps expose as additional read-only mode attributes.

        Perhaps postpone for a layered extension.


    13. What happens if the user attempts to delete a screen surface that
        is currently being shown?

        Spec currently says that's illegal and that an error (TBD) will be
        generated.


    14. What if the physical screen size can't be determined?  Should
        a query of EGL_PHYSICAL_SIZE_MESA return [0,0]?

        Obsolete: EGL_PHYSICAL_SIZE_MESA not used.


    15. Suppose the device's number of RAMDACs is different from the
        number of output ports.  For example, a graphics card with
        two RAMDACs but three ports (VGA, DVI, TV).

        Address this in a follow-on extension. [Matthias Hopf]


    16. How should we deal with on-the-fly device changes?  For example,
        the monitor being unplugged and replaced by another with different
        characteristics?

        A HAL event could be received via DBUS in the application [J. Smirl,
        A. Jackson].

        Should there be an EGL mechanism for detecting this?  Maybe an
        EGL_SCREEN_LOST error (similar to EGL_CONTEXT_LOST) can be recorded
        when there's a screen change.  At least then the application can
        poll to detect this situation.

        Maybe leave that to a future extension.

        See also the EGL_SCREEN_COUNT_MESA query.


    17. What if pixel-accurate panning is not supported (see
        eglScreenPositionMESA)? [M. Danzer]

        Is this a common problem?  Can we ignore it for now?


    18. Should eglShowSurfaceMESA be renamed to eglShowScreenSurfaceMESA?

        Probably.

Additions to Chapter X of the EGL 1.1 Specification

    [XXX this all has to be rewritten to fit into the EGL specification
    and match the conventions of an EGL extension.  For now, just list
    all the functions with brief descriptions.]


    EGLBoolean eglChooseModeMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, const EGLScreenMESA screen,
                                 EGLint *attrib_list, EGLModeMESA *modes,
                                 EGLint modes_size, EGLint *num_modes)

    Like eglChooseConfig, returns a list of EGLModes which match the given
    attribute list.  This does not set the screen's current display mode.
    The attribute list is a list of token/value pairs terminated with
    EGL_NONE.  Supported attributes include:

        Name                   Description
        ---------------------  ---------------------------------------------
        EGL_WIDTH              Mode width (resolution)
        EGL_HEIGHT             Mode height (resolution)
        EGL_REFRESH_RATE_MESA  The mode's refresh rate, multiplied by 1000
        EGL_INTERLACED_MESA    1 indicates an interlaced mode, 0 otherwise
        EGL_OPTIMAL_MESA       Set if the most is especially optimal for the
                               screen (ex. for particular LCD resolutions)

    Any other token will generate the error EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE.

    The list of modes returned by eglChooseModeMESA will be sorted
    according to the following criteria.  See the discussion of table 3.3
    in the EGL specification for more information.

                                            Selection   Sort   Sort
        Attribute            Default        Criteria    Order  Priority
        -------------------- -------------- ----------- ------ --------
        EGL_OPTIMAL_MESA     EGL_DONT_CARE  Exact       1,0      1
        EGL_INTERLACED_MESA  EGL_DONT_CARE  Exact       0,1      2
        EGL_REFRESH_RATE     EGL_DONT_CARE  AtLeast     Larger   3
        EGL_WIDTH            EGL_DONT_CARE  AtLeast     Larger   4
        EGL_HEIGHT           EGL_DONT_CARE  AtLeast     Larger   5
        EGL_MODE_ID_MESA     EGL_DONT_CARE  Exact       Smaller  6


    EGLBoolean eglGetModesMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA screen,
                               EGLModeMESA *modes, EGLint modes_size,
                               EGLint *num_modes)

    Like eglGetConfigs, returns a list of all modes supported by the
    given screen.  The returned modes will be sorted in the same manner
    as for eglChooseModeMESA().



    EGLBoolean eglGetModeAttribMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLModeMESA mode,
                                    EGLint attrib, EGLint *value)

    Used to query mode attributes.  The following attributes are supported:

        Name                   Return value description
        ---------------------  ----------------------------------------------
        EGL_OPTIMAL_MESA       1 indicates an optimal mode, 0 otherwise
        EGL_INTERLACED_MESA    1 indicates an interlaced mode, 0 otherwise
        EGL_REFRESH_RATE_MESA  The mode's refresh rate, multiplied by 1000
        EGL_WIDTH              Mode width (resolution)
        EGL_HEIGHT             Mode height (resolution)
        EGL_MODE_ID_MESA       A unique small integer identifier for the mode

    Any other token will generate the error EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE.



    EGLBoolean eglGetScreensMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA *screens,
                                 EGLint screens_size, EGLint *num_screens)

    This function returns an array of all available screen handles.
    <screens_size> is the maximum number of screens to return in the
    <screens> array.  <num_screens> will return the number of screen handles
    placed in the array, even if <screens> is NULL.

    The number of screens and the availability of each may change over
    time (hot-plugging).  Screen handles will not be reused.  When a
    screen handle becomes invalid, function calls which reference an
    invalid handle will generate EGL_BAD_SCREEN_MESA.

    The first screen handle returned will be considered to be the primary
    one.



    EGLSurface eglCreateScreenSurfaceMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLConfig config,
                                          const EGLint *attrib_list)

    Create a surface that can be displayed on a screen.  <attrib_list> is
    an array of token/value pairs terminated with EGL_NONE.  Valid tokens
    include:

        Name              Description
        ----------------  --------------------------------
        EGL_WIDTH         desired surface width in pixels
        EGL_HEIGHT        desired surface height in pixels

    Any other token will generate the error EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE.
    The default width and height are zero.

    

    EGLBoolean eglShowSurfaceMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA screen,
                                  EGLSurface surface, EGLModeMESA mode)

    This function causes a screen to show the given surface (or more
    precisely, the surface's front color buffer) with the given mode.

    If the surface is in any way incompatible with the mode, the error
    EGL_BAD_MATCH will be generated, EGL_FALSE will be returned, and the
    previous screen state will remain in effect.  This might occur when
    the bandwidth of the video-out subsystem is exceeded, or if the mode
    specifies a width or height that's greater than the width or height
    of the surface.

    To disable a screen, the values EGL_NO_SURFACE and EGL_NO_MODE_MESA
    be passed as the <surface> and <mode> parameters.

    The values of EGL_SCREEN_POSITION_MESA are clamped to the new valid
    range computed from the screen size and surface size.  If the new
    surface is EGL_NO_SURFACE, EGL_SCREEN_POSITION_MESA is set to [0, 0].


    Attempting to delete a screen surface which is currently being
    displayed will result in the error EGL_BAD_ACCESS being generated.



    EGLBoolean eglScreenPositionMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA screen,
                                     EGLint x, EGLint y)

    Specifies the origin of the screen's view into the surface, if the
    surface is larger than the screen.  Valid values for x and y are
    [0, surfaceWidth - screenWidth] and [0, surfaceHeight - screenHeight],
    respectively.

    The x and y values are also constrained to be integer multiples of the
    EGL_SCREEN_POSITION_GRANULARITY_MESA values.




    EGLBoolean eglQueryScreenMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA screen,
                                  EGLint attrib, EGLint *value);

    Used to query screen attributes.  <attrib> may be one of the following:

        Name                      Return value description
        ------------------------  ---------------------------------------------
        EGL_SCREEN_POSITION_MESA  x, y position of the screen's origin with
                                  respect to the surface.  If no surface is
                                  attached to the screen, [0, 0] is returned.
        EGL_SCREEN_POSITION_GRANULARITY_MESA
                                  Returns the granularity, in pixels, for
                                  which the screen position is constrained.

    Any other token will generate the error EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE.




    EGLBoolean eglQueryScreenSurfaceMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA screen,
                                         EGLSurface *surface)

    Returns the surface currently displayed on the given screen.  <surface>
    may be EGL_NO_SURFACE if the screen isn't currently showing any surface.




    EGLBoolean eglQueryScreenModeMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLScreenMESA screen,
                                      EGLModeMESA *mode)

    Returns the given screen's current display mode.  The mode may be
    EGL_NO_MODE_MESA if the screen is currently disabled.



    const char *eglQueryModeStringMESA(EGLDisplay dpy, EGLModeMESA mode);

    Returns a human-readable string for the given mode.  The string is a
    zero-terminated C string which the user should not attempt to free.
    There is no standard syntax for mode strings.  Applications should
    not directly rely on mode strings.
