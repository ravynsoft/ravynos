Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

Mesa 4.0.1 only contains bug fixes since version 4.0.

See the docs/VERSIONS file for the list of bug fixes.
