Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 3.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 3.4) designate stable releases.

Mesa 4.0.3 basically just contains bug fixes version 4.0.2.

See the docs/VERSIONS file for the list of bug fixes.

The GGI driver has been updated, thanks to Filip Spacek.


Device Drivers
--------------

Mesa advertises itself as either OpenGL 1.2 or OpenGL 1.3 depending on the
device driver.  If the driver enables all the ARB extensions which are part
of OpenGL 1.3 then glGetString(GL_VERSION) will return "1.3".  Otherwise,
it'll return "1.2".

A number of Mesa's software drivers haven't been actively maintained for
some time.  We rely on volunteers to maintain many of the drivers.
Here's the current status of all included drivers:

Driver			Status

XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.3
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.3
FX (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3

Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.3
DOS/DJGPP		implements OpenGL 1.3 (new in Mesa 4.0.2)
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			needs updating
Allegro			needs updating
