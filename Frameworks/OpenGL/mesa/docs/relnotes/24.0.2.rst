Mesa 24.0.2 Release Notes / 2024-02-28
======================================

Mesa 24.0.2 is a bug fix release which fixes bugs found since the 24.0.1 release.

Mesa 24.0.2 implements the OpenGL 4.6 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) or glGetIntegerv(GL_MAJOR_VERSION) /
glGetIntegerv(GL_MINOR_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being used.
Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL 4.6. OpenGL
4.6 is **only** available if requested at context creation.
Compatibility contexts may report a lower version depending on each driver.

Mesa 24.0.2 implements the Vulkan 1.3 API, but the version reported by
the apiVersion property of the VkPhysicalDeviceProperties struct
depends on the particular driver being used.
