Performs the sequence of pattern modification operations, if \fIkind\fR is
FcMatchPattern, then those tagged as pattern operations are applied, else
if \fIkind\fR is FcMatchFont, those tagged as font operations are applied and
p_pat is used for <test> elements with target=pattern. Returns FcFalse
if the substitution cannot be performed (due to allocation failure). Otherwise returns FcTrue.
