  "\n    curl - transfer a URL",
  "\nSYNOPSIS",
  "\n    curl [options / URLs]",
  "\nDESCRIPTION",
  "\n    curl is a tool  for transferring data  from or to a  server using URLs.  It",
  "    supports these protocols:  DICT, FILE,  FTP, FTPS,  GOPHER, GOPHERS,  HTTP,",
  "    HTTPS, IMAP,  IMAPS, LDAP,  LDAPS, MQTT,  POP3, POP3S,  RTMP, RTMPS,  RTSP,",
  "    SCP, SFTP, SMB, SMBS, SMTP, SMTPS, TELNET, TFTP, WS and WSS.",
  "\n    curl  is  powered  by  libcurl  for  all  transfer-related  features.   See",
  "    libcurl(3) for details.",
  "\nURL",
  "\n    The URL syntax is  protocol-dependent. You find  a detailed description  in",
  "    RFC 3986.",
  "\n    If you provide  a URL without  a leading  protocol:// scheme, curl  guesses",
  "    what protocol you want. It then  defaults to HTTP but assumes others  based",
  "    on often-used hostname prefixes. For  example, for hostnames starting  with",
  "    \"ftp.\" curl assumes you want FTP.",
  "\n    You can specify any  amount of URLs on the  command line. They are  fetched",
  "    in a sequential manner  in the specified  order unless you use  --parallel.",
  "    You can specify  command line options and  URLs mixed and  in any order  on",
  "    the command line.",
  "\n    curl attempts to reuse connections  when doing multiple transfers, so  that",
  "    getting many files from  the same server do  not use multiple connects  and",
  "    setup handshakes. This improves  speed. Connection reuse  can only be  done",
  "    for URLs  specified for  a single  command line  invocation  and cannot  be",
  "    performed between separate curl runs.",
  "\n    Provide an IPv6 zone  id in the URL with  an escaped percentage sign.  Like",
  "    in",
  "\n\t\"http://[fe80::3%25eth0]/\"",
  "\n    Everything provided on the command line  that is not a command line  option",
  "    or its argument, curl assumes is a URL and treats it as such.",
  "\nGLOBBING",
  "\n    You can specify  multiple URLs  or parts  of URLs by  writing lists  within",
  "    braces or ranges within brackets. We call this \"globbing\".",
  "\n    Provide a list with three different names like this:",
  "\n\t\"http://site.{one,two,three}.com\"",
  "\n    Do sequences of alphanumeric series by using [] as in:",
  "\n\t\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[1-100].txt\"",
  "\n    With leading zeroes:",
  "\n\t\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[001-100].txt\"",
  "\n    With letters through the alphabet:",
  "\n\t\"ftp://ftp.example.com/file[a-z].txt\"",
  "\n    Nested sequences are not  supported, but you can  use several ones next  to",
  "    each other:",
  "\n\t\"http://example.com/archive[1996-1999]/vol[1-4]/part{a,b,c}.html\"",
  "\n    You can specify a step  counter for the ranges  to get every Nth number  or",
  "    letter:",
  "\n\t\"http://example.com/file[1-100:10].txt\"",
  "\n\t\"http://example.com/file[a-z:2].txt\"",
  "\n    When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line  prompt, you",
  "    probably have to put the full  URL within double quotes to avoid the  shell",
  "    from interfering  with it.  This  also goes  for other  characters  treated",
  "    special, like for example '&', '?' and '*'.",
  "\n    Switch off globbing with --globoff.",
  "\nVARIABLES",
  "\n    curl supports command line variables  (added in 8.3.0). Set variables  with",
  "    --variable name=content or --variable name@file (where \"file\" can be  stdin",
  "    if set to a single dash (-)).",
  "\n    Variable contents can be expanded in option parameters using \"{{name}}\"  if",
  "    the option name  is prefixed with  \"--expand-\". This  gets the contents  of",
  "    the variable \"name\" inserted, or  a blank if the  name does not exist as  a",
  "    variable. Insert  \"{{\"  verbatim  in the  string  by prefixing  it  with  a",
  "    backslash, like \"\\{{\".",
  "\n    You access and expand  environment variables by  first importing them.  You",
  "    select to either  require the  environment variable  to be set  or you  can",
  "    provide a default value  in case it is  not already set. Plain  \"--variable",
  "    %name\" imports the variable called \"name\"  but exits with an error if  that",
  "    environment variable is not already set.  To provide a default value if  it",
  "    is not set, use \"--variable %name=content\" or \"--variable %name@content\".",
  "\n    Example. Get the USER  environment variable into the  URL, fail if USER  is",
  "    not set:",
  "\n\t--variable '%USER'",
  "\t--expand-url = \"https://example.com/api/{{USER}}/method\"",
  "\n    When expanding variables, curl  supports a set  of functions that can  make",
  "    the variable  contents more  convenient to  use. It  can  trim leading  and",
  "    trailing white space  with \"trim\",  it can  output the contents  as a  JSON",
  "    quoted string with \"json\", URL encode the string with \"url\",  base64 encode",
  "    it with \"b64\" and  base64 decode it with \"64dec\".  To apply functions to  a",
  "    variable expansion,  add them  colon separated  to the  right  side of  the",
  "    variable. Variable content  holding null  bytes that are  not encoded  when",
  "    expanded causes an error.",
  "\n    Example: get the contents  of a file  called $HOME/.secret into a  variable",
  "    called \"fix\". Make  sure that  the content is  trimmed and  percent-encoded",
  "    when sent as POST data:",
  "\n\t--variable %HOME",
  "\t--expand-variable fix@{{HOME}}/.secret",
  "\t--expand-data \"{{fix:trim:url}}\"",
  "\thttps://example.com/",
  "\n    Command line variables and expansions were added in 8.3.0.",
  "\nOUTPUT",
  "\n    If not told otherwise, curl writes  the received data to stdout. It can  be",
  "    instructed to instead save that data into a local file, using  the --output",
  "    or --remote-name options.  If curl is  given multiple  URLs to transfer  on",
  "    the command line,  it similarly needs  multiple options  for where to  save",
  "    them.",
  "\n    curl does  not  parse or  otherwise \"understand\"  the  content it  gets  or",
  "    writes as output. It does no encoding or decoding, unless  explicitly asked",
  "    to with dedicated command line options.",
  "\nPROTOCOLS",
  "\n    curl supports  numerous  protocols, or  put  in URL  terms:  schemes.  Your",
  "    particular build may not support them all.",
  "\n    DICT",
  "\n\tLets you lookup words using online dictionaries.",
  "\n    FILE",
  "\n\tRead or write local files. curl does not support accessing  file:// URL",
  "\tremotely, but when running  on Microsoft Windows  using the native  UNC",
  "\tapproach works. Only absolute paths.",

  "\tlevers. With or without using TLS.",
  "\n    GOPHER(S)",
  "\n\tRetrieve files.",
  "\n    HTTP(S)",
  "\n\tcurl supports HTTP with numerous  options and variations. It can  speak",
  "\tHTTP version 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2 and 3 depending on build options  and the",
  "\tcorrect command line options.",
  "\n    IMAP(S)",
  "\n\tUsing the  mail reading  protocol, curl  can download  emails for  you.",
  "\tWith or without using TLS.",
  "\n    LDAP(S)",
  "\n\tcurl can do directory lookups for you, with or without TLS.",
  "\n    MQTT",
  "\n\tcurl supports MQTT version 3. Downloading over MQTT equals  subscribing",
  "\tto a topic while uploading/posting  equals publishing on a topic.  MQTT",
  "\tover TLS is not supported (yet).",
  "\n    POP3(S)",
  "\n\tDownloading from a pop3 server means getting an email. With  or without",
  "\tusing TLS.",
  "\n    RTMP(S)",
  "\n\tThe Realtime Messaging  Protocol is primarily  used to serve  streaming",
  "\tmedia and curl can download it.",
  "\n    RTSP",
  "\n\tcurl supports RTSP 1.0 downloads.",
  "\n    SCP",
  "\n\tcurl supports SSH version 2 scp transfers.",
  "\n    SFTP",
  "\n\tcurl supports SFTP (draft 5) done over SSH version 2.",

  "\n\tcurl can do TFTP downloads and uploads.",
  "\n    WS(S)",
  "\n\tWebSocket done over HTTP/1. WSS implies that it works over HTTPS.",
  "\nPROGRESS METER",
  "\n    curl normally displays a progress  meter during operations, indicating  the",
  "    amount of transferred data, transfer  speeds and estimated time left,  etc.",
  "    The progress  meter displays the  transfer rate  in bytes  per second.  The",
  "    suffixes (k, M, G, T, P) are  1024 based. For example 1k is 1024 bytes.  1M",
  "    is 1048576 bytes.",
  "\n    curl displays this data to the  terminal by default, so if you invoke  curl",
  "    to do  an operation  and it  is about  to write  data to  the terminal,  it",
  "    disables the  progress  meter as  otherwise it  would  mess up  the  output",
  "    mixing progress meter and response data.",
  "\n    If you want a  progress meter for  HTTP POST or PUT  requests, you need  to",
  "    redirect the response output to a file, using shell redirect  (>), --output",
  "    or similar.",
  "\n    This does not apply to FTP upload  as that operation does not spit out  any",
  "    response data to the terminal.",
  "\n    If you prefer a progress  bar instead of the regular meter,  --progress-bar",
  "    is your friend.  You can also  disable the  progress meter completely  with",
  "    the --silent option.",
  "\nVERSION",
  "\n    This man page describes  curl 8.16.0. If you  use a later version,  chances",
  "    are this  man page  does  not fully  document  it. If  you use  an  earlier",
  "    version, this document  tries to  include version  information about  which",
  "    specific version that introduced changes.",
  "\n    You can always learn which the latest curl version is by running",
  "\n\tcurl https://curl.se/info",
  "\n    The  online  version  of  this  man  page  is  always  showing  the  latest",
  "    incarnation: https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html",
  "\nOPTIONS",
  "\n    Options start  with one  or  two dashes.  Many of  the options  require  an",
  "    additional value  next to  them. If  provided text  does not  start with  a",
  "    dash, it is presumed to be and treated as a URL.",
  "\n    The short \"single-dash\" form  of the options, -d  for example, may be  used",
  "    with or without a  space between it  and its value, although  a space is  a",
  "    recommended separator.  The  long  double-dash form,  --data  for  example,",
  "    requires a space between it and its value.",
  "\n    Short version options that  do not need any  additional values can be  used",
  "    immediately next to each  other, like for example  you can specify all  the",
  "    options -O, -L and -v at once as -OLv.",
  "\n    In general, all  boolean options are  enabled with  --option and yet  again",
  "    disabled with  --no-option.  That is,  you use  the  same option  name  but",
  "    prefix it with \"no-\".  However, in this list we  mostly only list and  show",
  "    the --option version of them.",
  "\n    When --next is used, it resets the parser state and you start again  with a",
  "    clean option state, except for the options that are global.  Global options",
  "    retain their values and meaning even after --next.",
  "\n    If the long  option name ends with  an equals sign  (\"=\"), the argument  is",
  "    the text following on its right side. (Added in 8.16.0)",
  "\n    The first argument  that is  exactly two  dashes (\"--\"), marks  the end  of",
  "    options; any argument  after the  end of  options is interpreted  as a  URL",
  "    argument even if it starts with a dash.",
  "\n    curl does  little  to  no verification  of  the contents  of  command  line",
  "    arguments.  Passing  in  \"creative  octets\"  like  newlines  might  trigger",
  "    unexpected results.",
  "\n    The   following    options    are    global:    --fail-early,    --libcurl,",
  "    --parallel-immediate,  --parallel-max-host,   --parallel-max,   --parallel,",
  "    --progress-bar,   --rate,    --show-error,    --stderr,    --styled-output,",

  "\n    --anyauth",
  "\t    (HTTP) Figure out authentication method automatically, and use  the",
  "\t    most secure one the remote site claims to support. This is  done by",
  "\t    first doing  a  request  and checking  the  response-headers,  thus",
  "\t    possibly inducing an extra network round-trip. This option is  used",
  "\t    instead of setting a specific authentication method, which you  can",
  "\t    do with --basic, --digest, --ntlm, and --negotiate.",
  "\n\t    Using --anyauth is not  recommended if you  do uploads from  stdin,",
  "\t    since it may  require data  to be  sent twice and  then the  client",
  "\t    must be able  to rewind. If  the need  should arise when  uploading",
  "\t    from stdin, the upload operation fails.",
  "\n\t    Used together with --user.",

  "\t    (FTP SFTP) When used  in an upload,  this option makes curl  append",
  "\t    to the target file  instead of overwriting  it. If the remote  file",
  "\t    does not exist, it  is created. Note that  this flag is ignored  by",
  "\t    some SFTP servers (including OpenSSH). Providing --append  multiple",

  "\t    of a resources  collection (region-code)  when the  region name  is",
  "\t    omitted from the endpoint.",
  "\n\t    The  service argument  is  a  string  that  points  to  a  function",
  "\t    provided by  a  cloud  (service-code)  when  the  service  name  is",
  "\t    omitted from  the  endpoint.  If --aws-sigv4  is  provided  several",

  "\n\t    Added in 7.75.0. See also --basic and --user.",
  "\n    --basic",
  "\t    (HTTP) Use HTTP  Basic authentication  with the  remote host.  This",
  "\t    method is the default and this option is usually pointless,  unless",
  "\t    you use  it  to  override  a  previously set  option  that  sets  a",
  "\t    different authentication  method  (such  as  --ntlm,  --digest,  or",
