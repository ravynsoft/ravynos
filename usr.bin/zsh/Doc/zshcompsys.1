.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This describes the shell code for the `new\&' completion system, referred
to as \fBcompsys\fP\&.  It is written in shell functions based on the
features described in
\fIzshcompwid\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The features are contextual, sensitive to the point at which completion is
started\&.  Many completions are already provided\&.
For this reason, a user can perform a great many tasks without
knowing any details beyond how to initialize the system, which is
described
below in INITIALIZATION\&.
.PP
The context that decides what completion is to be performed may be
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
an argument or option position: these describe the position on the
command line at which completion is requested\&.  For example `first argument
to rmdir, the word being completed names a directory\&';

.TP
\(bu
a special context, denoting an element in the shell\&'s syntax\&.  For example
`a word in command position\&' or `an array subscript'\&.

.PP
A full context specification contains other elements, as we shall describe\&.
.PP
Besides commands names and contexts, the system employs two more
concepts, \fIstyles\fP and \fItags\fP\&.  These provide ways for the user
to configure the system\&'s behaviour\&.
.PP
Tags play a dual role\&.  They serve as a classification system for
the matches, typically indicating a class of object that the user
may need to distinguish\&.  For example, when completing arguments of the
\fBls\fP command the user may prefer to try \fBfiles\fP before \fBdirectories\fP,
so both of these are tags\&.  They also appear as the rightmost
element in a context specification\&.
.PP
Styles modify various operations of the completion system, such as
output formatting, but also what kinds of completers are used (and in
what order), or which tags are examined\&.  Styles may accept arguments
and are manipulated using the \fBzstyle\fP command described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.
.PP
In summary, tags describe \fIwhat\fP the completion objects are, and style
\fBhow\fP they are to be completed\&.  At various points of execution, the
completion system checks what styles and/or tags are defined for the
current context, and uses that to modify its behavior\&.  The full
description of context handling, which determines how tags and other
elements of the context influence the behaviour of styles, is described
below in COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\&.
.PP
When a completion is requested, a dispatcher function is called;
see the description of \fB_main_complete\fP in the list of control functions
below\&. This dispatcher decides which function should
be called to produce the completions, and calls it\&. The result is
passed to one or more \fIcompleters\fP, functions that implement
individual completion strategies: simple completion, error correction,
completion with error correction, menu selection, etc\&.
.PP
More generally, the shell functions contained in the completion system are
of two types:
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
those beginning `\fBcomp\fP\&' are to be called directly; there are only
a few of these;

.TP
\(bu
those beginning `\fB_\fP\&' are called by the
completion code\&.  The shell functions of this set, which implement
completion behaviour and may be bound to keystrokes, are referred to
as `widgets\&'\&.  These proliferate as new completions are required\&.

.PP
.PP
.SH "INITIALIZATION"
.PP
If the system was installed completely, it should be enough to
call the shell function \fBcompinit\fP from your initialization file; see the
next section\&.  However, the function \fBcompinstall\fP can be run by a user
to configure various aspects of the completion system\&.
.PP
Usually, \fBcompinstall\fP will insert code into \fB\&.zshrc\fP, although if
that is not writable it will save it in another file and tell you that
file\&'s location\&.  Note that it is up to you to make sure that the lines
added to \fB\&.zshrc\fP are actually run; you may, for example, need to move
them to an earlier place in the file if \fB\&.zshrc\fP usually returns early\&.
So long as you keep them all together (including the comment lines at the
start and finish), you can rerun \fBcompinstall\fP and it will correctly
locate and modify these lines\&.  Note, however, that any code you add to
this section by hand is likely to be lost if you rerun \fBcompinstall\fP,
although lines using the command `\fBzstyle\fP\&' should be gracefully handled\&.
.PP
The new code will take effect next time you start the shell, or run
\fB\&.zshrc\fP by hand; there is also an option to make them take effect
immediately\&.  However, if \fBcompinstall\fP has removed definitions, you will
need to restart the shell to see the changes\&.
.PP
To run \fBcompinstall\fP you will need to make sure it is in a directory
mentioned in your \fBfpath\fP parameter, which should already be the case if
zsh was properly configured as long as your startup files do not remove the
appropriate directories from \fBfpath\fP\&.  Then it must be autoloaded
(`\fBautoload \-U compinstall\fP\&' is recommended)\&.  You can abort the
installation any time you are being prompted for information, and your
\fB\&.zshrc\fP will not be altered at all; changes only take place right at the
end, where you are specifically asked for confirmation\&.
.PP
.SS "Use of compinit"
.PP
This section describes the use of \fBcompinit\fP to initialize completion for
the current session when called directly; if you have run
\fBcompinstall\fP it will be called automatically from your \fB\&.zshrc\fP\&.
.PP
To initialize the system, the function \fBcompinit\fP should be in a
directory mentioned in the \fBfpath\fP parameter, and should be autoloaded
(`\fBautoload \-U compinit\fP\&' is recommended), and then run simply as
`\fBcompinit\fP\&'\&.  This will define a
few utility functions, arrange for all the necessary shell functions to be
autoloaded, and will then re\-define all widgets that do completion to use the
new system\&.  If you use the \fBmenu\-select\fP widget, which is part of the
\fBzsh/complist\fP module, you should make sure that that module is loaded
before the call to \fBcompinit\fP so that that widget is also
re\-defined\&.  If completion styles (see below) are set up to perform
expansion as well as completion by default, and the TAB key is bound to
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP, \fBcompinit\fP will rebind it to \fBcomplete\-word\fP;
this is necessary to use the correct form of expansion\&.
.PP
Should you need to use the original completion commands, you can still
bind keys to the old widgets by putting a `\fB\&.\fP\&' in front of the
widget name, e\&.g\&. `\fB\&.expand\-or\-complete\fP\&'\&.
.PP
To speed up the running of \fBcompinit\fP, it can be made to produce a dumped
configuration that will be read in on future invocations; this is the
default, but can be turned off by calling \fBcompinit\fP with the
option \fB\-D\fP\&.  The dumped file is \fB\&.zcompdump\fP in the same
directory as the startup files (i\&.e\&. \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP or \fB$HOME\fP);
alternatively, an explicit file name can be given by `\fBcompinit \-d\fP
\fIdumpfile\fP\&'\&.  The next invocation of \fBcompinit\fP will read the dumped
file instead of performing a full initialization\&.
.PP
If the number of completion files changes, \fBcompinit\fP will recognise this
and produce a new dump file\&.  However, if the name of a function or the
arguments in the first line of a \fB#compdef\fP function (as described below)
change, it is easiest to delete the dump file by hand so that
\fBcompinit\fP will re\-create it the next time it is run\&.  The check
performed to see if there are new functions can be omitted by giving
the option \fB\-C\fP\&.  In this case the dump file will only be created if
there isn\&'t one already\&.
.PP
The dumping is actually done by another function, \fBcompdump\fP, but you
will only need to run this yourself if you change the configuration
(e\&.g\&. using \fBcompdef\fP) and then want to dump the new one\&.  The name of
the old dumped file will be remembered for this purpose\&.
.PP
If the parameter \fB_compdir\fP is set, \fBcompinit\fP uses it as a directory
where completion functions can be found; this is only necessary if they are
not already in the function search path\&.
.PP
For security reasons \fBcompinit\fP also checks if the completion system
would use files not owned by root or by the current user, or files in
directories that are world\- or group\-writable or that are not owned by 
root or by the current user\&.  If such files or directories are found,
\fBcompinit\fP will ask if the completion system should really be used\&.  To
avoid these tests and make all files found be used without asking, use the
option \fB\-u\fP, and to make \fBcompinit\fP silently ignore all insecure files
and directories use the option \fB\-i\fP\&.  This security check is skipped
entirely when the \fB\-C\fP option is given, provided the dumpfile exists\&.
.PP
The security check can be retried at any time by running the function
\fBcompaudit\fP\&.  This is the same check used by \fBcompinit\fP, but when it
is executed directly any changes to \fBfpath\fP are made local to the
function so they do not persist\&.  The directories to be checked may be
passed as arguments; if none are given, \fBcompaudit\fP uses \fBfpath\fP and
\fB_compdir\fP to find completion system directories, adding missing ones
to \fBfpath\fP as necessary\&.  To force a check of exactly the directories
currently named in \fBfpath\fP, set \fB_compdir\fP to an empty string before
calling \fBcompaudit\fP or \fBcompinit\fP\&.
.PP
The function \fBbashcompinit\fP provides compatibility with bash\&'s programmable
completion system\&.  When run it will define the functions, \fBcompgen\fP and
\fBcomplete\fP which correspond to the bash builtins with the same names\&.
It will then be possible to use completion specifications and functions
written for bash\&.
.PP
.SS "Autoloaded files"
.PP
The convention for autoloaded functions used in completion is that they
start with an underscore; as already mentioned, the \fBfpath/FPATH\fP
parameter must contain the directory in which they are stored\&.  If \fBzsh\fP
was properly installed on your system, then \fBfpath/FPATH\fP automatically
contains the required directories for the standard functions\&.
.PP
For incomplete installations, if \fBcompinit\fP does not find enough files
beginning with an underscore (fewer than twenty) in the search path, it
will try to find more by adding the directory \fB_compdir\fP to the search
path\&.  If that directory has a subdirectory named \fBBase\fP, all
subdirectories will be added to the path\&.  Furthermore, if the subdirectory
\fBBase\fP has a subdirectory named \fBCore\fP, \fBcompinit\fP will add all
subdirectories of the subdirectories to the path: this allows
the functions to be in the same format as in the \fBzsh\fP source
distribution\&.
.PP
When \fBcompinit\fP is run, it searches all such files accessible via
\fBfpath/FPATH\fP and reads the first line of each of them\&.  This line should
contain one of the tags described below\&.  Files whose first line does not
start with one of these tags are not considered to be part of the
completion system and will not be treated specially\&.
.PP
The tags are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB#compdef\fP \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. [ \fB\-\fP{\fBp\fP|\fBP\fP} \fIpattern\fP \&.\&.\&. [ \fB\-N\fP \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. ] ]
The file will be made autoloadable and the function defined 
in it will be called when completing \fIname\fPs, each of which is
either the name of a command whose arguments are to be completed or one of
a number of special contexts in the form \fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP described
below\&.
.RS
.PP
Each \fIname\fP may also be of the form `\fIcmd\fP\fB=\fP\fIservice\fP\&'\&.
When completing the command \fIcmd\fP, the function typically behaves as
if the command (or special context) \fIservice\fP was being completed
instead\&.  This provides a way of altering the behaviour of functions
that can perform many different completions\&.  It is implemented
by setting the parameter \fB$service\fP when calling the function;
the function may choose to interpret this how it wishes, and simpler
functions will probably ignore it\&.
.PP
If the \fB#compdef\fP line contains one of the options \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-P\fP,
the words following are taken to be patterns\&.  The function will be
called when completion is attempted for a command or context that matches
one of the patterns\&.  The options \fB\-p\fP and \fB\-P\fP are used to specify
patterns to be tried before or after other completions respectively\&.
Hence \fB\-P\fP may be used to specify default actions\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-N\fP is used after a list following \fB\-p\fP or \fB\-P\fP; it
specifies that remaining words no longer define patterns\&.  It is
possible to toggle between the three options as many times as necessary\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB#compdef \-k\fP \fIstyle key\-sequence\fP \&.\&.\&.
This option creates a widget behaving like the
builtin widget \fIstyle\fP and binds it to the given \fIkey\-sequence\fPs,
if any\&.  The \fIstyle\fP must be one of the builtin widgets that perform
completion, namely \fBcomplete\-word\fP, \fBdelete\-char\-or\-list\fP,
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP, \fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP, \fBlist\-choices\fP,
\fBmenu\-complete\fP, \fBmenu\-expand\-or\-complete\fP, or
\fBreverse\-menu\-complete\fP\&.  If the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded (see
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)) the widget \fBmenu\-select\fP is also available\&.
.RS
.PP
When one of the \fIkey\-sequence\fPs is typed, the function in the file will
be invoked to generate the matches\&.  Note that a key will not be re\-bound
if it already was (that is, was bound to something other than
\fBundefined\-key\fP)\&.  The widget created has the same name as the file and
can be bound to any other keys using \fBbindkey\fP as usual\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB#compdef \-K\fP \fIwidget\-name\fP \fIstyle\fP \fIkey\-sequence\fP [ \fIname\fP \fIstyle\fP \fIseq\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This is similar to \fB\-k\fP except that only one \fIkey\-sequence\fP
argument may be given for each \fIwidget\-name\fP \fIstyle\fP pair\&.
However, the entire set of three arguments may be repeated with a
different set of arguments\&.  Note in particular that the
\fIwidget\-name\fP must be distinct in each set\&.  If it does not begin with
`\fB_\fP\&' this will be added\&.  The \fIwidget\-name\fP should not clash with
the name of any existing widget: names based on the name of the function
are most useful\&.  For example,
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB#compdef \-K _foo_complete complete\-word "^X^C" \e 
  _foo_list list\-choices "^X^D"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
(all on one line) defines a widget \fB_foo_complete\fP for completion, bound
to `\fB^X^C\fP\&', and a widget \fB_foo_list\fP for listing, bound to `\fB^X^D\fP'\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB#autoload\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ]
Functions with the \fB#autoload\fP tag are marked for autoloading but
are not otherwise treated specially\&.  Typically they are to be called
from within one of the completion functions\&.  Any \fIoptions\fP supplied
will be passed to the \fBautoload\fP builtin; a typical use is \fB+X\fP to
force the function to be loaded immediately\&.  Note that the \fB\-U\fP and
\fB\-z\fP flags are always added implicitly\&.
.PP
The \fB#\fP is part of the tag name and no white space is allowed after it\&.
The \fB#compdef\fP tags use the \fBcompdef\fP function described below; the
main difference is that the name of the function is supplied implicitly\&.
.PP
The special contexts for which completion functions can be defined are:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-array\-value\-\fP
The right hand side of an array\-assignment
(`\fIname\fP\fB=(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP\&')
.TP
\fB\-assign\-parameter\-\fP
The name of a parameter in an assignment, i\&.e\&. on the left hand side of
an `\fB=\fP\&'
.TP
\fB\-brace\-parameter\-\fP
The name of a parameter expansion within braces (`\fB${\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP\&')
.TP
\fB\-command\-\fP
A word in command position
.TP
\fB\-condition\-\fP
A word inside a condition (`\fB[[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]]\fP\&')
.TP
\fB\-default\-\fP
Any word for which no other completion is defined
.TP
\fB\-equal\-\fP
A word beginning with an equals sign
.TP
\fB\-first\-\fP
This is tried before any other completion function\&.  The function called
may set the \fB_compskip\fP parameter to one of various values: 
\fBall\fP: no further completion is attempted; a string
containing the substring \fBpatterns\fP: no pattern completion functions
will be called; a string containing \fBdefault\fP: the
function for the `\fB\-default\-\fP\&' context will not be called, but
functions defined for commands will be\&.
.TP
\fB\-math\-\fP
Inside mathematical contexts, such as
`\fB((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&'
.TP
\fB\-parameter\-\fP
The name of a parameter expansion (`\fB$\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&')
.TP
\fB\-redirect\-\fP
The word after a redirection operator\&.
.TP
\fB\-subscript\-\fP
The contents of a parameter subscript\&.
.TP
\fB\-tilde\-\fP
After an initial tilde (`\fB~\fP\&'), but before the first slash
in the word\&.
.TP
\fB\-value\-\fP
On the right hand side of an assignment\&.
.PP
Default implementations are supplied for each of these
contexts\&.  In most cases the context \fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP is
implemented by a corresponding function \fB_\fP\fIcontext\fP, for example
the context `\fB\-tilde\-\fP\&' and the function `\fB_tilde\fP')\&.
.PP
The contexts \fB\-redirect\-\fP and \fB\-value\-\fP allow extra context\-specific
information\&.  (Internally, this is handled by the functions for each
context calling the function \fB_dispatch\fP\&.)  The extra
information is added separated by commas\&.
.PP
For the \fB\-redirect\-\fP context, the extra information is in the form
`\fB\-redirect\-,\fP\fIop\fP\fB,\fP\fIcommand\fP\&', where \fIop\fP is the
redirection operator and \fIcommand\fP is the name of the command on
the line\&.  If there is no command on the line yet, the \fIcommand\fP
field will be empty\&.
.PP
For the \fB\-value\-\fP context, the form is
`\fB\-value\-,\fP\fIname\fP\fB,\fP\fIcommand\fP\&', where \fIname\fP is the name of
the parameter on the left hand side of the assignment\&.
In the case of elements of an associative array, for
example `\fBassoc=(key <TAB>\fP\&', \fIname\fP is expanded to
`\fIname\fP\fB\-\fP\fIkey\fP\&'\&.  In certain special contexts, such as
completing after `\fBmake CFLAGS=\fP\&', the \fIcommand\fP part gives the
name of the command, here \fBmake\fP; otherwise it is empty\&.
.PP
It is not necessary to define fully specific completions as the
functions provided will try to generate completions by progressively
replacing the elements with `\fB\-default\-\fP\&'\&.  For example, when
completing after `\fBfoo=<TAB>\fP\&', \fB_value\fP will try the names
`\fB\-value\-,foo,\fP\&' (note the empty \fIcommand\fP part),
`\fB\-value\-,foo,\-default\-\fP\&' and`\fB\-value\-,\-default\-,\-default\-\fP', in
that order, until it finds a function to handle the context\&.
.PP
As an example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompdef \&'_files \-g "*\&.log"' '\-redirect\-,2>,\-default\-'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
completes files matching `\fB*\&.log\fP\&' after `\fB2> <TAB>\fP' for any
command with no more specific handler defined\&.
.PP
Also:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompdef _foo \-value\-,\-default\-,\-default\-\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
specifies that \fB_foo\fP provides completions for the values of
parameters for which no special function has been defined\&.  This is
usually handled by the function \fB_value\fP itself\&.
.PP
The same lookup rules are used when looking up styles (as described
below); for example
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:\-redirect\-,2>,*:*' file\-patterns '*\&.log'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is another way to make completion after `\fB2> <TAB>\fP\&' complete files
matching `\fB*\&.log\fP\&'\&.

The first form defines the \fIfunction\fP to call for completion in the
given contexts as described for the \fB#compdef\fP tag above\&.
.RS
.PP
Alternatively, all the arguments may have the form
`\fIcmd\fP\fB=\fP\fIservice\fP\&'\&.  Here \fIservice\fP should already have been
defined by `\fIcmd1\fP\fB=\fP\fIservice\fP\&' lines in \fB#compdef\fP files, as
described above\&.  The argument for \fIcmd\fP will be completed in the
same way as \fIservice\fP\&.
.PP
The \fIfunction\fP argument may alternatively be a string containing
almost any shell code\&.  If the string contains an equal sign, the above
will take precedence\&.  The option \fB\-e\fP may be used to specify the first
argument is to be evaluated as shell code even if it contains an equal
sign\&.  The string will be executed using the \fBeval\fP builtin command to
generate completions\&.  This provides a way of avoiding having to define
a new completion function\&.  For example, to complete files ending in
`\fB\&.h\fP\&' as arguments to the command \fBfoo\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompdef \&'_files \-g "*\&.h"' foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The option \fB\-n\fP prevents any completions already defined for the
command or context from being overwritten\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-d\fP deletes any completion defined for the command or
contexts listed\&.
.PP
The \fIname\fPs may also contain \fB\-p\fP, \fB\-P\fP and \fB\-N\fP options as
described for the \fB#compdef\fP tag\&.  The effect on the argument list is
identical, switching between definitions of patterns tried initially,
patterns tried finally, and normal commands and contexts\&.
.PP
The parameter \fB$_compskip\fP may be set by any function defined for a
pattern context\&.  If it is set to a value containing the substring
`\fBpatterns\fP\&' none of the pattern\-functions will be called; if it is
set to a value containing the substring `\fBall\fP\&', no other function
will be called\&.  Setting \fB$_compskip\fP in this manner is of particular
utility when using the \fB\-p\fP option, as otherwise the dispatcher will
move on to additional functions (likely the default one) after calling
the pattern\-context one, which can mangle the display of completion
possibilities if not handled properly\&.
.PP
The form with \fB\-k\fP defines a widget with the same name as the \fIfunction\fP
that will be called for each of the \fIkey\-sequence\fPs; this is like the
\fB#compdef \-k\fP tag\&.  The function should generate the completions needed
and will otherwise behave like the builtin widget whose name is given as
the \fIstyle\fP argument\&.  The widgets usable for this are:
\fBcomplete\-word\fP, \fBdelete\-char\-or\-list\fP, \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP,
\fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP, \fBlist\-choices\fP, \fBmenu\-complete\fP,
\fBmenu\-expand\-or\-complete\fP, and \fBreverse\-menu\-complete\fP, as well as
\fBmenu\-select\fP if the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded\&.  The option \fB\-n\fP
prevents the key being bound if it is already to bound to something other
than \fBundefined\-key\fP\&.
.PP
The form with \fB\-K\fP is similar and defines multiple widgets based on the
same \fIfunction\fP, each of which requires the set of three arguments
\fIname\fP, \fIstyle\fP and \fIkey\-seq\fPuence, where the latter two are as
for \fB\-k\fP and the first must be a unique widget name beginning with an
underscore\&.
.PP
Wherever applicable, the \fB\-a\fP option makes the \fIfunction\fP
autoloadable, equivalent to \fBautoload \-U \fP\fIfunction\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
The function \fBcompdef\fP can be used to associate existing completion
functions with new commands\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcompdef _pids foo\fP
.fi

.PP
uses the function \fB_pids\fP to complete process IDs for the command \fBfoo\fP\&.

Note also the \fB_gnu_generic\fP function described below, which can be
used to complete options for commands that understand the
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&' option\&.

.SH "COMPLETION SYSTEM CONFIGURATION"
.PP
This section gives a short overview of how the completion system works,
and then more detail on how users can configure how and when matches are
generated\&.
.PP
.SS "Overview"
.PP
When completion is attempted somewhere on the command line the
completion system begins building the context\&.  The context represents
everything that the shell knows about the meaning of the command line
and the significance of the cursor position\&.  This takes account of a
number of things including the command word (such as `\fBgrep\fP\&' or
`\fBzsh\fP\&') and options to which the current word may be an argument
(such as the `\fB\-o\fP\&' option to \fBzsh\fP which takes a shell option as an
argument)\&.
.PP
The context starts out very generic ("we are beginning a completion")
and becomes more specific as more is learned ("the current word is in a
position that is usually a command name" or "the current word might be a
variable name" and so on)\&.  Therefore the context will vary during the
same call to the completion system\&.
.PP
This context information is condensed into a string consisting of multiple
fields separated by colons, referred to simply as `the context\&' in the
remainder of the documentation\&.  Note that a user of the completion system
rarely needs to compose a context string, unless for example a new
function is being written to perform completion for a new command\&.  What a
user may need to do is compose a \fIstyle\fP pattern, which is matched
against a context when needed to look up context\-sensitive options that
configure the completion system\&.
.PP
The next few paragraphs explain how a context is composed within the
completion function suite\&.  Following that is discussion of how \fIstyles\fP
are defined\&.  Styles determine such things as how the matches are
generated, similarly to shell options but with much more control\&.  They
are defined with the \fBzstyle\fP builtin command (see \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.
.PP
The context string always consists of a fixed set of fields, separated
by colons and with a leading colon before the first\&.  Fields which are
not yet known are left empty, but the surrounding colons appear anyway\&.
The fields are always in the order
\fB:completion:\fP\fIfunction\fP\fB:\fP\fIcompleter\fP\fB:\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB:\fP\fIargument\fP\fB:\fP\fItag\fP\&.  These have the following meaning:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
The literal string \fBcompletion\fP, saying that this style is used by
the completion system\&.  This distinguishes the context from those used
by, for example, zle widgets and ZFTP functions\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fIfunction\fP, if completion is called from a named widget rather
than through the normal completion system\&.  Typically this is blank, but
it is set by special widgets such as \fBpredict\-on\fP and the various
functions in the \fBWidget\fP directory of the distribution to the name of
that function, often in an abbreviated form\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fIcompleter\fP currently active, the name of the function without the
leading underscore and with other underscores converted to hyphens\&.  A
`completer\&' is in overall control of how completion is to be performed;
`\fBcomplete\fP\&' is the simplest, but other completers exist to perform
related tasks such as correction, or to modify the behaviour of a later
completer\&.  See
the section `Control Functions\&' below 
for more information\&.  

.TP
\(bu
The \fIcommand\fP or a special \fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP, just at it appears
following the \fB#compdef\fP tag or the \fBcompdef\fP function\&.  Completion
functions for commands that have sub\-commands usually modify this field
to contain the name of the command followed by a minus sign and the
sub\-command\&.  For example, the completion function for the \fBcvs\fP
command sets this field to \fBcvs\-add\fP when completing arguments to
the \fBadd\fP subcommand\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fIargument\fP; this indicates which command line or option argument
we are completing\&.  For command arguments this generally takes the form
\fBargument\-\fP\fIn\fP, where \fIn\fP is the number of the argument,
and for arguments to options the form \fBoption\-\fP\fIopt\fP\fB\-\fP\fIn\fP
where \fIn\fP is the number of the argument to option \fIopt\fP\&.  However,
this is only the case if the command line is parsed with standard
UNIX\-style options and arguments, so many completions do not set this\&.

.TP
\(bu
The \fItag\fP\&.  As described previously, tags are used to discriminate between
the types of matches a completion function can generate in a certain context\&.
Any completion function may use any tag name it likes, but a list of the
more common ones is given below\&.

.PP
The context is gradually put together as the functions are executed, starting
with the main entry point, which adds \fB:completion:\fP and the \fIfunction\fP
element if necessary\&.  The completer then adds the \fIcompleter\fP element\&.
The contextual completion adds the \fIcommand\fP and \fIargument\fP options\&.
Finally, the \fItag\fP is added when the types of completion are known\&.
For example, the context name
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fB:completion::complete:dvips:option\-o\-1:files\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
says that normal completion was attempted as the first argument to the
option \fB\-o\fP of the command \fBdvips\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBdvips \-o \&.\&.\&.\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and the completion function will generate filenames\&.
.PP
Usually completion will be tried for all possible tags in an order given
by the completion function\&.  However, this can be altered by using the
\fBtag\-order\fP style\&.  Completion is then restricted to the list of given
tags in the given order\&.
.PP
The \fB_complete_help\fP bindable command shows all the contexts and tags
available for completion at a particular point\&.  This provides an easy
way of finding information for \fBtag\-order\fP and other styles\&.  It is
described in
the section `Bindable Commands\&' below\&.
.PP
When looking up styles the completion system uses full context names,
including the tag\&.  Looking up the value of a style therefore consists of
two things: the context, which is matched to the most specific (best
fitting) pattern, and the name of the style itself, which must be
matched exactly\&.  The following examples demonstrate that patterns
may be loosely defined for styles that apply broadly, or as tightly
defined as desired for styles that apply in narrower circumstances\&.
.PP
For example, many completion functions can generate matches in a
simple and a verbose form and use the \fBverbose\fP style to decide
which form should be used\&.  To make all such functions use the verbose form,
put
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' verbose yes\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
in a startup file (probably \fB\&.zshrc\fP)\&.
This gives the \fBverbose\fP style the value \fByes\fP in every
context inside the completion system, unless that context has a more
specific definition\&.  It is best to avoid giving the pattern as `\fB*\fP\&'
in case the style has some meaning outside the completion system\&.
.PP
Many such general purpose styles can be configured simply by using the
\fBcompinstall\fP function\&.
.PP
A more specific example of the use of the \fBverbose\fP style is by the
completion for the \fBkill\fP builtin\&.  If the style is set, the builtin
lists full job texts and process command lines; otherwise it shows the
bare job numbers and PIDs\&.  To turn the style off for this use only:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:kill:*:*' verbose no\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
For even more control, the style can use one of the tags `\fBjobs\fP\&' or
`\fBprocesses\fP\&'\&.  To turn off verbose display only for jobs:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:kill:*:jobs' verbose no\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\-e\fP option to \fBzstyle\fP even allows completion function code to
appear as the argument to a style; this requires some understanding of
the internals of completion functions (see
see \fIzshcompwid\fP(1)))\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBzstyle \-e \&':completion:*' hosts 'reply=($myhosts)'\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This forces the value of the \fBhosts\fP style to be read from the
variable \fBmyhosts\fP each time a host name is needed; this is useful
if the value of \fBmyhosts\fP can change dynamically\&.
For another useful example, see the example in the description of the
\fBfile\-list\fP style below\&.  This form can be
slow and should be avoided for commonly examined styles such
as \fBmenu\fP and \fBlist\-rows\-first\fP\&.
.PP
Note that the order in which styles are \fIdefined\fP does not matter; the
style mechanism uses the most specific possible match for a particular
style to determine the set of values\&.  Strings are
preferred over patterns (for example, `\fB:completion::complete:::foo\fP\&' is
more specific than `\fB:completion::complete:::*\&'\fP), and longer patterns are
preferred over the pattern `\fB*\fP\&'\&. See 
\fIzmodules\fP(1)
for details\&.
.PP
Context patterns that use something other than a wildcard (\fB*\fP) to match the
middle parts of the context \-\- the \fIcompleter\fP, \fIcommand\fP, and
\fIargument\fP in
\fB:completion:\fP\fIfunction\fP\fB:\fP\fIcompleter\fP\fB:\fP\fIcommand\fP\fB:\fP\fIargument\fP\fB:\fP\fItag\fP
\-\- should include all six colons (\fB:\fP) explicitly\&. Without this,
a pattern such as \fB:completion:*:foo:*\fP could match \fBfoo\fP against a
component other than the intended one (for example, against \fIcompleter\fP when
a match against \fIcommand\fP was intended)\&.
.PP
Style names like those of tags are arbitrary and depend on the completion
function\&.  However, the following two sections list some of the most
common tags and styles\&.

.SS "Standard Styles"
.PP
Note that the values of several of these styles represent boolean
values\&.  Any of the strings `\fBtrue\fP\&', `\fBon\fP',
`\fByes\fP\&', and `\fB1\fP' can be used for the value `true' and
any of the strings `\fBfalse\fP\&', `\fBoff\fP', `\fBno\fP', and `\fB0\fP' for
the value `false\&'\&.  The behavior for any other value is undefined 
except where explicitly mentioned\&.  The default value may
be either `true\&' or `false' if the style is not set\&.
.PP
Some of these styles are tested first for every possible tag
corresponding to a type of match, and if no style was found, for the
\fBdefault\fP tag\&.  The most notable styles of this type are \fBmenu\fP, 
\fBlist\-colors\fP and styles controlling completion listing such as 
\fBlist\-packed\fP and \fBlast\-prompt\fP\&.  When tested for the \fBdefault\fP
tag, only the \fIfunction\fP field of the context will be set so that
a style using the \fBdefault\fP tag will normally be defined along the lines of:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:default' menu \&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBaccept\-exact\fP
This is tested for the \fBdefault\fP tag in addition to the tags valid for
the current context\&.  If it is set to `true\&' and any of the trial
matches is the same as the string on the command line, this match will
immediately be accepted (even if it would otherwise be considered
ambiguous)\&.
.RS
.PP
When completing pathnames (where the tag used is `\fBpaths\fP\&')
this style accepts any number of patterns as the value in addition to
the boolean values\&.  Pathnames matching one of these
patterns will be accepted immediately even if the command line contains
some more partially typed pathname components and these match no file
under the directory accepted\&.
.PP
This style is also used by the \fB_expand\fP completer to decide if
words beginning with a tilde or parameter expansion should be
expanded\&.  For example, if there are parameters
\fBfoo\fP and \fBfoobar\fP, the string `\fB$foo\fP\&' will only be expanded if 
\fBaccept\-exact\fP is set to `true\&'; otherwise the completion system will
be allowed to complete \fB$foo\fP to \fB$foobar\fP\&. If the style is set to
`\fBcontinue\fP\&', \fB_expand\fP will add the expansion as a match and the completion
system will also be allowed to continue\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBaccept\-exact\-dirs\fP
This is used by filename completion\&.  Unlike \fBaccept\-exact\fP it is
a boolean\&.  By default, filename completion examines all components
of a path to see if there are completions of that component, even if
the component matches an existing directory\&.  For example, when
completion after \fB/usr/bin/\fP, the function examines possible
completions to \fB/usr\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
When this style is `true\&', any prefix of a path that matches an existing
directory is accepted without any attempt to complete it further\&.
Hence, in the given example, the path \fB/usr/bin/\fP is accepted
immediately and completion tried in that directory\&.
.PP
This style is also useful when completing after directories that
magically appear when referenced, such as ZFS \fB\&.zfs\fP directories
or NetApp \fB\&.snapshot\fP directories\&.  When the style is set the
shell does not check for the existence of the directory within the
parent directory\&.
.PP
If you wish to inhibit this behaviour entirely, set the \fBpath\-completion\fP
style (see below) to `false\&'\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBadd\-space\fP
This style is used by the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  If it is `true\&' (the
default), a space will be inserted after all words resulting from the 
expansion, or a slash in the case of directory names\&.  If the value
is `\fBfile\fP\&', the completer will only add a space
to names of existing files\&.  Either a boolean `true\&' or the value
`\fBfile\fP\&' may be combined with `\fBsubst\fP', in which case the completer
will not add a space to words generated from the expansion of a
substitution of the form `\fB$(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP\&' or `\fB${\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP'\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB_prefix\fP completer uses this style as a simple boolean value
to decide if a space should be inserted before the suffix\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBambiguous\fP
This applies when completing non\-final components of filename paths, in
other words those with a trailing slash\&.  If it is set, the cursor is
left after the first ambiguous component, even if menu completion is in
use\&.  The style is always tested with the \fBpaths\fP tag\&.
.TP
\fBassign\-list\fP
When completing after an equals sign that is being treated as an
assignment, the completion system normally completes only one filename\&.
In some cases the value  may be a list of filenames separated by colons,
as with \fBPATH\fP and similar parameters\&.  This style can be set to a
list of patterns matching the names of such parameters\&.
.RS
.PP
The default is to complete lists when the word on the line already
contains a colon\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBauto\-description\fP
If set, this style\&'s value will be used as the description for options that
are not described by the completion functions, but that have exactly
one argument\&.  The sequence `\fB%d\fP\&' in the value will be replaced by
the description for this argument\&.  Depending on personal preferences,
it may be useful to set this style to something like `\fBspecify: %d\fP\&'\&. 
Note that this may not work for some commands\&.
.TP
\fBavoid\-completer\fP
This is used by the \fB_all_matches\fP completer to decide if the string 
consisting of all matches should be added to the list currently being
generated\&.  Its value is a list of names of completers\&.  If any of
these is the name of the completer that generated the matches in this
completion, the string will not be added\&.
.RS
.PP
The default value for this style is `\fB_expand _old_list _correct
_approximate\fP\&', i\&.e\&. it contains the completers for which a string
with all matches will almost never be wanted\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcache\-path\fP
This style defines the path where any cache files containing dumped
completion data are stored\&.  It defaults to `\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zcompcache\fP\&', or
`\fB$HOME/\&.zcompcache\fP\&' if \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP is not defined\&.  The completion
cache will not be used unless the \fBuse\-cache\fP style is set\&.
.TP
\fBcache\-policy\fP
This style defines the function that will be used to determine whether
a cache needs rebuilding\&.  See the section on the \fB_cache_invalid\fP
function below\&.
.TP
\fBcall\-command\fP
This style is used in the function for commands such as \fBmake\fP and
\fBant\fP where calling the command directly to generate matches suffers
problems such as being slow or, as in the case of \fBmake\fP can
potentially cause actions in the makefile to be executed\&. If it is set
to `true\&' the command is called to generate matches\&. The default value
of this style is `false\&'\&.
.TP
\fBcommand\fP
In many places, completion functions need to call external commands to
generate the list of completions\&.  This style can be used to override the
command that is called in some such cases\&.  The elements of the value are
joined with spaces to form a command line to execute\&.  The value can also
start with a hyphen, in which case the usual command will be added to the
end; this is most useful for putting `\fBbuiltin\fP\&' or `\fBcommand\fP' in
front to make sure the appropriate version of a command is called, for
example to avoid calling a shell function with the same name as an external
command\&.
.RS
.PP
As an example, the completion function for process IDs uses this
style with the \fBprocesses\fP tag to generate the IDs to complete and
the list of processes to display (if the \fBverbose\fP style is `true\&')\&.
The list produced by the command should look like the output of the
\fBps\fP command\&.  The first line is not displayed, but is searched for
the string `\fBPID\fP\&' (or `\fBpid\fP') to find the position of the
process IDs in the following lines\&.  If the line does not contain
`\fBPID\fP\&', the first numbers in each of the other lines are taken as the 
process IDs to complete\&.
.PP
Note that the completion function generally has to call the specified
command for each attempt to generate the completion list\&.  Hence
care should be taken to specify only commands that take a short
time to run, and in particular to avoid any that may never terminate\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBcommand\-path\fP
This is a list of directories to search for commands to complete\&.  The
default for this style is the value of the special parameter \fBpath\fP\&.
.TP
\fBcommands\fP
This is used by the function completing sub\-commands for the system
initialisation scripts (residing in \fB/etc/init\&.d\fP or somewhere not
too far away from that)\&.  Its values give the default commands to
complete for those commands for which the completion function isn\&'t
able to find them out automatically\&.  The default for this style are
the two strings `\fBstart\fP\&' and `\fBstop\fP'\&.
.TP
\fBcomplete\fP
This is used by the \fB_expand_alias\fP function when invoked as a
bindable command\&.  If set to `true\&' and the word on the command
line is not the name of an alias, matching alias names will be
completed\&.
.TP
\fBcomplete\-options\fP
This is used by the completer for \fBcd\fP, \fBchdir\fP and \fBpushd\fP\&.
For these commands a \fB\-\fP is used to introduce a directory stack entry
and completion of these is far more common than completing options\&.
Hence unless the value of this style is `true\&' options will not be
completed, even after an initial \fB\-\fP\&.  If it is `true\&', options will
be completed after an initial \fB\-\fP unless there is a preceding
\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP on the command line\&.
.TP
\fBcompleter\fP
The strings given as the value of this style provide the names of the
completer functions to use\&. The available completer functions are
described in
the section `Control Functions\&' below\&.
.RS
.PP
Each string may be either the name of a completer function or a string
of the form `\fIfunction\fP\fB:\fP\fIname\fP\&'\&.  In the first case the
\fIcompleter\fP field of the context will contain the name of the
completer without the leading underscore and with all other
underscores replaced by hyphens\&.  In the second case the
\fIfunction\fP is the name of the completer to call, but the context
will contain the user\-defined \fIname\fP in the \fIcompleter\fP field of
the context\&.  If the \fIname\fP starts with a hyphen, the string for the
context will be build from the name of the completer function as in
the first case with the \fIname\fP appended to it\&.  For example: 
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' completer _complete _complete:\-foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here, completion will call the \fB_complete\fP completer twice, once
using `\fBcomplete\fP\&' and once using `\fBcomplete\-foo\fP' in the
\fIcompleter\fP field of the context\&.  Normally, using the same
completer more than once only makes sense when used with the
`\fIfunctions\fP\fB:\fP\fIname\fP\&' form, because otherwise the context
name will be the same in all calls to the completer; possible
exceptions to this rule are the \fB_ignored\fP and \fB_prefix\fP

\fBdelimiters\fP
This style is used when adding a delimiter for use with history

The following shows a way of supplementing any tag with arbitrary data, but

the standard completer \fBcomplete\fP for arguments of \fBcd\fP\&.  The tag
\fBnamed\-directories\-normal\fP behaves as normal, but the tag
\fBnamed\-directories\-mine\fP contains a fixed set of directories\&.

\fBfake\-files\fP
This style is used when completing files and looked up

separated by spaces) as
possible matches when completing in the directory \fIdir\fP, even if no 
such files really exist\&.  The dir may be a pattern; pattern characters
or colons in \fIdir\fP should be quoted with a backslash to be treated
literally\&.
.RS
.PP
This can be useful on systems that support special file systems whose
top\-level pathnames can not be listed or generated with glob patterns

does not have read permission\&.
.PP
The pattern form can be used to add a certain `magic\&' entry
to all directories on a particular file system\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfake\-parameters\fP
This is used by the completion function for parameter names\&.
Its values are names of parameters that might not yet be
set but should be completed nonetheless\&.  Each name may also be 
followed by a colon and a string specifying the type of the parameter
(like `\fBscalar\fP\&', `\fBarray\fP' or `\fBinteger\fP')\&.  If the type is
given, the name will only be completed if parameters of that type are
required in the particular context\&.  Names for which no type is
specified will always be completed\&.
.TP
\fBfile\-list\fP
This style controls whether files completed using the standard builtin
mechanism are to be listed with a long list similar to \fBls \-l\fP\&.
Note that this feature uses the shell module
\fBzsh/stat\fP for file information; this loads the builtin \fBstat\fP
which will replace any external \fBstat\fP executable\&.  To avoid
this the following code can be included in an initialization file:
.RS
.PP

\fBzmodload \-i zsh/stat

.RE
.PP
The style may either be set to a `true\&' value (or `\fBall\fP'), or
one of the values `\fBinsert\fP\&' or `\fBlist\fP', indicating that files
are to be listed in long format in all circumstances, or when
attempting to insert a file name, or when listing file names
without attempting to insert one\&.
.PP
More generally, the value may be an array of any of the above values,
optionally followed by \fB=\fP\fInum\fP\&.  If \fInum\fP is present it
gives the maximum number of matches for which long listing style
will be used\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' file\-list list=20 insert=10\fP

.RE

specifies that long format will be used when listing up to 20 files

\fBfile\-patterns\fP
This is used by the standard function for completing filenames,
\fB_files\fP\&.  If the style is unset up to three tags are offered,
`\fBglobbed\-files\fP\&',`\fBdirectories\fP' and `\fBall\-files\fP', depending on
the types of files  expected by the caller of \fB_files\fP\&.  The first two
(`\fBglobbed\-files\fP\&' and `\fBdirectories\fP') are normally offered
together to make it easier to complete files in sub\-directories\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fBfile\-patterns\fP style provides alternatives to the default tags,
which are not used\&.  Its value consists of elements of the form
`\fIpattern\fP\fB:\fP\fItag\fP\&'; each string may contain any number of
such specifications separated by spaces\&.
.PP
The \fIpattern\fP is a pattern that is to be used to generate filenames\&.
Any occurrence of the sequence `\fB%p\fP\&' is replaced by any
pattern(s)
passed by the function calling \fB_files\fP\&.  Colons in the pattern must
be preceded by a backslash to make them distinguishable from the colon
before the \fItag\fP\&.  If more than one pattern is needed, the patterns
can be given inside braces, separated by commas\&.
.PP
The \fItag\fPs of all strings in the value will be offered by \fB_files\fP
and used when looking up other styles\&.  Any \fItag\fPs in the same
word will be offered at the same time and before later words\&.
If no `\fB:\fP\fItag\fP\&' is given the `\fBfiles\fP' tag will be used\&.
.PP
The \fItag\fP may also be followed by an optional second colon and a
description, which will be used for the `\fB%d\fP\&' in the value of
the \fBformat\fP style (if that is set) instead of the default
description supplied by the completion function\&.  The inclusion
of a description also gives precedence to associated options such as
for completion grouping so it can be used where files should be
separated\&.
.PP
For example, to make the \fBrm\fP command first complete only names of
object files and then the names of all files if there is no matching
object file:
.PP

This works even where there is no special pattern: \fB_files\fP matches
all files using the pattern `\fB*\fP\&' at the first step and stops when it
sees this pattern\&.  Note also it will never try a pattern more than once
for a single completion attempt\&.
.PP
To separate directories into a separate group from the files but still
complete them at the first attempt, a description needs to be given\&.
Note that directories need to be explicitly excluded from the
globbed\-files because `\fB*\fP\&' will match directories\&. For grouping, it
is also necessary to set the \fBgroup\-name\fP style\&.

.RE
.TP
\fBfile\-sort\fP
The standard filename completion function uses this style without a tag
to determine in which order the names should be listed; menu completion
will cycle through them in the same order\&.  The possible
values are: `\fBsize\fP\&' to sort by the size of the file;
`\fBlinks\fP\&' to sort by the number of links to the file;
`\fBmodification\fP\&' (or `\fBtime\fP' or `\fBdate\fP') to sort by the last
modification time; `\fBaccess\fP\&' to sort by the last access time; and
`\fBinode\fP\&' (or `\fBchange\fP') to sort by the last inode change
time\&.  If the style is set to any other value, or is unset, files will be
sorted alphabetically by name\&.  If the value contains the string
`\fBreverse\fP\&', sorting is done in the opposite order\&.  If the value
contains the string `\fBfollow\fP\&', timestamps are associated with the
targets of symbolic links; the default is to use the timestamps
of the links themselves\&.
.TP
\fBfile\-split\-chars\fP
A set of characters that will cause \fIall\fP file completions for
the given context to be split at the point where any of the characters
occurs\&.  A typical use is to set the style to \fB:\fP; then everything
up to and including the last \fB:\fP in the string so far is ignored when
completing files\&.  As this is quite heavy\-handed, it is usually
preferable to update completion functions for contexts where this
behaviour is useful\&.
.TP
\fBfilter\fP
The \fBldap\fP plugin of email address completion (see \fB_email_addresses\fP) uses
this style to specify
the attributes to match against when filtering entries\&.  So for example, if
the style is set to `\fBsn\fP\&', matching is done against surnames\&.  Standard
LDAP filtering is used so normal completion matching is bypassed\&.  If this
style is not set, the LDAP plugin is skipped\&.  You may also need to set the
\fBcommand\fP style to specify how to connect to your LDAP server\&.
.TP
\fBforce\-list\fP
This forces a list of completions to be shown at any point where listing is
done, even in cases where the list would usually be suppressed\&.
For example, normally the list is only shown if
there are at least two different matches\&.  By setting this style to
`\fBalways\fP\&', the list will always be shown, even if there is only a
single match that will immediately be accepted\&.  The style may also
be set to a number\&.  In this case the list will be shown if there are
at least that many matches, even if they would all insert the same
string\&.
.RS

This style is tested for the default tag as well as for each tag valid
for the current completion\&.  Hence the listing can be forced only for
certain types of match\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBformat\fP
If this is set for the \fBdescriptions\fP tag, its value is used as a
string to display above matches in completion lists\&.  The sequence
`\fB%d\fP\&' in this string will be replaced with a short description of
what these matches are\&.  This string may also contain the output
attribute sequences understood by \fBcompadd \-X\fP
(see
\fIzshcompwid\fP(1))\&.
.RS
.PP
The style is tested with each tag valid for the current completion
before it is tested for the \fBdescriptions\fP tag\&.  Hence different format 
strings can be defined for different types of match\&.

Note also that some completer functions define additional
`\fB%\fP\&'\-sequences\&.  These are described for the completer functions that 
make use of them\&.
.PP
Some completion functions display messages that may be customised by
setting this style for the \fBmessages\fP tag\&.  Here, the `\fB%d\fP\&' is

.PP
Finally, the format string is looked up with the \fBwarnings\fP tag, 
for use when no matches could be generated at all\&.  In this case the
`\fB%d\fP\&' is replaced with the descriptions for the matches that were
expected separated by spaces\&.  The sequence `\fB%D\fP\&' is replaced with
the same descriptions separated by newlines\&.
.PP
It is possible to use printf\-style field width specifiers with `\fB%d\fP\&'

builtin command from the \fBzsh/zutil\fP module, see

\fBgain\-privileges\fP
If set to \fBtrue\fP, this style enables the use of commands like \fBsudo\fP
or \fBdoas\fP to gain extra privileges when retrieving information for

the command\-line\&. To force the use of, e\&.g\&. \fBsudo\fP or to override any
prefix that might be added due to \fBgain\-privileges\fP, the \fBcommand\fP

\fBgroup\-name\fP
The completion system can group different types of matches, which appear
in separate lists\&.  This style can be used to give the names of groups
for particular tags\&.  For example, in command position the completion

aliases, shell functions and parameters and reserved words as possible
completions\&.  To have the external commands and shell functions listed

\fBkeep\-prefix\fP
This style is used by the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  If it is `true\&', the

`\fBchanged\fP\&' (the default), the prefix will only be left unchanged if
there were other changes between the expanded words and the original
word from the command line\&.  Any other value forces the prefix to be
expanded unconditionally\&.
.RS

The behaviour of \fB_expand\fP when this style is `true\&' is to cause \fB_expand\fP

\fB/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts\fP and \fB~/\&.ssh/known_hosts\fP are used\&.

\fBlast\-prompt\fP
This is a more flexible form of the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option\&.
If it is `true\&', the completion system will try to return the cursor to
the previous command line after displaying a completion list\&.  It is
tested for all tags valid for the current completion, then the
\fBdefault\fP tag\&.  The cursor will be moved back to the
previous line if this style is `true\&' for all types of match\&.  Note
that unlike the \fBALWAYS_LAST_PROMPT\fP option this is independent of the
numeric argument\&.
.TP
\fBlist\fP
This style is used by the \fB_history_complete_word\fP bindable command\&.
If it is set to `true\&' it has no effect\&.  If it is set to `false'
matches will not be listed\&.  This overrides the setting of the options
controlling listing behaviour, in particular \fBAUTO_LIST\fP\&.  The context
always starts with `\fB:completion:history\-words\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBlist\-colors\fP
If the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded, this style can be used to set
color specifications\&.  This mechanism replaces the use of the
\fBZLS_COLORS\fP and \fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters described in
the section `The zsh/complist Module\&' in \fIzshmodules\fP(1), but the syntax is the same\&.
.RS
.PP
If this style is set for the \fBdefault\fP tag, the strings in the value 
are taken as specifications that are to be used everywhere\&.  If it is
set for other tags, the specifications are used only for matches of
the type described by the tag\&.  For this to work best, the \fBgroup\-name\fP
style must be set to an empty string\&.  
.PP
In addition to setting styles for specific tags, it is also possible to
use group names specified explicitly by the \fBgroup\-name\fP tag together
with the `\fB(group)\fP\&' syntax allowed by the \fBZLS_COLORS\fP and
\fBZLS_COLOURS\fP parameters and simply using the \fBdefault\fP tag\&.

It is possible to use any color specifications already set up for the GNU

.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:default' list\-colors \e

The default colors are the same as for the GNU \fBls\fP command and can be
obtained by setting the style to an empty string (i\&.e\&. \fB\&''\fP)\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBlist\-dirs\-first\fP
This is used by file completion and corresponds to a particular
setting of the \fBfile\-patterns\fP style\&.
If set, the default directories to be completed
are listed separately from and before completion for other files\&.
.TP
\fBlist\-grouped\fP
If this style is `true\&' (the default), the completion system will try to
make certain completion listings more compact by grouping matches\&.
For example, options for commands that have the same description (shown
when the \fBverbose\fP style is set to `true\&') will appear as a single
entry\&.  However, menu selection can be used to cycle through all the
matches\&.
.TP
\fBlist\-packed\fP
This is tested for each tag valid in the current context as well as the
\fBdefault\fP tag\&.  If it is set to `true\&', the corresponding matches
appear in listings as if the \fBLIST_PACKED\fP option were set\&.  If it is
set to `false\&', they are listed normally\&.
.TP
\fBlist\-prompt\fP
If this style is set for the \fBdefault\fP tag,
completion lists that don\&'t fit on the screen can be scrolled (see
the description of the \fBzsh/complist\fP module in \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.  The value, if not the empty string, will be displayed after every
screenful and the shell will prompt for a key press; if the style is
set to the empty string,
a default prompt will be used\&.
.RS
.PP
The value may contain the escape sequences:
`\fB%l\fP\&' or `\fB%L\fP', which will be replaced by the number of the last line
displayed and the total number of lines; `\fB%m\fP\&' or `\fB%M\fP', 
the number of the  last match shown and the total number of
matches; and `\fB%p\fP\&' and `\fB%P\fP', `\fBTop\fP'
when at the beginning of the list, `\fBBottom\fP\&' when at the end and the
position shown as a percentage of the total length otherwise\&.  In each
case the form with the uppercase letter will be replaced by a string of fixed
width, padded to the  right with spaces, while the lowercase form will
be replaced by a variable width string\&.  As in other prompt strings, the
escape sequences `\fB%S\fP\&', `\fB%s\fP', `\fB%B\fP', `\fB%b\fP', `\fB%U\fP',
`\fB%u\fP\&' for entering and leaving the display modes
standout, bold and underline, and `\fB%F\fP\&', `\fB%f\fP', `\fB%K\fP', `\fB%k\fP' for
changing the foreground background colour, are also available, as is the form
`\fB%{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB%}\fP\&' for enclosing escape sequences which display with zero

After deleting this prompt the variable \fBLISTPROMPT\fP should be unset for

\fBlist\-rows\-first\fP
This style is tested in the same way as the \fBlist\-packed\fP style and
determines whether matches are to be listed in a rows\-first fashion as

.TP
\fBlist\-separator\fP
The value of this style is used in completion listing to separate the
string to complete from a description when possible (e\&.g\&. when
completing options)\&.  It defaults to `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' (two hyphens)\&.
.TP
\fBlist\-suffixes\fP
This style is used by the function that completes filenames\&.  If it is
`true\&', and completion is attempted on a string containing multiple partially
typed pathname components, all ambiguous components will be shown\&.
Otherwise, completion stops at the first ambiguous component\&.
.TP
\fBlocal\fP
This is for use with functions that complete URLs for which the
corresponding files are available directly from the file system\&.
Its value should consist of three strings: a
hostname, the path to the default web pages for the server, and the
directory name used by a user placing web pages within their home
area\&.

\fBmail\-directory\fP
If set, zsh will assume that mailbox files can be found in
the directory specified\&.  It defaults to `\fB~/Mail\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBmatch\-original\fP
This is used by the \fB_match\fP completer\&.  If it is set to
\fBonly\fP, \fB_match\fP will try to generate matches without inserting a
`\fB*\fP\&' at the cursor position\&.  If set to any other non\-empty value,
it will first try to generate matches without inserting the `\fB*\fP\&'
and if that yields no matches, it will try again with the `\fB*\fP\&'
inserted\&.  If it is unset or set to the empty string, matching will
only be performed with the `\fB*\fP\&' inserted\&.
.TP
\fBmatcher\fP
This style is tested separately for each tag valid in the current
context\&.  Its value is placed before any match specifications given by the
\fBmatcher\-list\fP style so can override them via the use of an \fBx:\fP
specification\&.  The value should be in the form described in
the section `Completion Matching Control\&' in \fIzshcompwid\fP(1)\&.  For examples of this, see the description of the \fBtag\-order\fP style\&.
.RS
.PP
For notes comparing the use of this and the \fBmatcher\-list\fP style, see

.RE
.TP
\fBmatcher\-list\fP
This style can be set to a list of match specifications that are to
be applied everywhere\&. Match specifications are described in
the section `Completion Matching Control\&' in \fIzshcompwid\fP(1)\&.
The completion system will try them one after another for each completer
selected\&.  For example, to try first simple completion and, if that
generates no matches, case\-insensitive completion:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' matcher\-list '' 'm:{a\-zA\-Z}={A\-Za\-z}'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
By default each specification replaces the previous one; however, if a
specification is prefixed with \fB+\fP, it is added to the existing list\&.
Hence it is possible to create increasingly general specifications
without repetition:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' matcher\-list \e 
       \&'' '+m:{a\-z}={A\-Z}' '+m:{A\-Z}={a\-z}'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
It is possible to create match specifications valid for particular
completers by using the third field of the context\&.  This applies only
to completers that override the global matcher\-list, which as of this
writing includes only \fB_prefix\fP and \fB_ignored\fP\&.  For example, to
use the completers \fB_complete\fP and \fB_prefix\fP but allow
case\-insensitive completion only with \fB_complete\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' completer _complete _prefix
zstyle \&':completion:*:complete:*:*:*' matcher\-list \e 
       \&'' 'm:{a\-zA\-Z}={A\-Za\-z}'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
User\-defined names, as explained for the \fBcompleter\fP style, are
available\&.  This makes it possible to try the same completer more than
once with different match specifications each time\&.  For example, to try
normal completion without a match specification, then normal completion
with case\-insensitive matching, then correction, and finally
partial\-word completion:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' completer \e 
    _complete _correct _complete:foo
zstyle \&':completion:*:complete:*:*:*' matcher\-list \e

    \&'m:{a\-zA\-Z}={A\-Za\-z} r:|[\-_\&./]=* r:|=*'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If the style is unset in any context no match specification is applied\&.
Note also that some completers such as \fB_correct\fP and \fB_approximate\fP
do not use the match specifications at all, though these completers will
only ever be called once even if the \fBmatcher\-list\fP contains more than
one element\&.
.PP
Where multiple specifications are useful, note that the \fIentire\fP
completion is done for each element of \fBmatcher\-list\fP, which can
quickly reduce the shell\&'s performance\&.  As a rough rule of thumb,
one to three strings will give acceptable performance\&.  On the other
hand, putting multiple space\-separated values into the same string does
not have an appreciable impact on performance\&.
.PP
If there is no current matcher or it is empty, and the option
\fBNO_CASE_GLOB\fP is in effect, the matching for files is performed
case\-insensitively in any case\&.  However, any matcher must
explicitly specify case\-insensitive matching if that is required\&.
.PP
For notes comparing the use of this and the \fBmatcher\fP style, see
under the description of the \fBtag\-order\fP style\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBmax\-errors\fP
This is used by the \fB_approximate\fP and \fB_correct\fP completer functions
to determine the maximum number of errors to allow\&.  The completer will try
to generate completions by first allowing one error, then two errors, and
so on, until either a match or matches were found or the maximum number of
errors given by this style has been reached\&.
.RS
.PP
If the value for this style contains the string `\fBnumeric\fP\&', the 
completer function will take any numeric argument as the
maximum number of errors allowed\&. For example, with
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:approximate:::' max\-errors 2 numeric\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
two errors are allowed if no numeric argument is given, but with
a numeric argument of six (as in `\fBESC\-6 TAB\fP\&'), up to six
errors are accepted\&.  Hence with a value of `\fB0 numeric\fP\&', no correcting
completion will be attempted unless a numeric argument is given\&.
.PP
If the value contains the string `\fBnot\-numeric\fP\&', the completer
will \fInot\fP try to generate corrected
completions when given a numeric argument, so in this case the number given
should be greater than zero\&.  For example, `\fB2 not\-numeric\fP\&' specifies that
correcting completion with two errors will usually be performed, but if a
numeric argument is given, correcting completion will not be
performed\&.
.PP
The default value for this style is `\fB2 numeric\fP\&'\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBmax\-matches\-width\fP
This style is used to determine the trade off between the width of the
display used for matches and the width used for their descriptions when
the \fBverbose\fP style is in effect\&.  The value gives the number of
display columns to reserve for the matches\&.  The default is half the
width of the screen\&.
.RS
.PP
This has the most impact when several matches have the
same description and so will be grouped together\&.  Increasing the style

more of the description to be visible\&.

\fBmenu\fP
If this is `true\&' in the context of any of the tags defined

a specific tag will take precedence over that for the `\fBdefault\fP\&' tag\&.
.RS

If none of the values found in this way is `true\&' but at least
one is set to `\fBauto\fP\&', the shell behaves as if the \fBAUTO_MENU\fP

If one of the values is explicitly set to `false\&', menu
completion will be explicitly turned off, overriding the
\fBMENU_COMPLETE\fP option and other settings\&.

In the form `\fByes=\fP\fInum\fP\&', where `\fByes\fP' may be any of the
`true\&' values (`\fByes\fP', `\fBtrue\fP', `\fBon\fP' and `\fB1\fP'),
menu completion will be turned on if there are at least \fInum\fP matches\&.
In the form `\fByes=long\fP\&', menu completion will be turned on
if the list does not fit on the screen\&.  This does not activate menu
completion if the widget normally only lists completions, but menu
completion can be activated in that case with the value `\fByes=long\-list\fP\&'
(Typically, the value `\fBselect=long\-list\fP\&' described later is more
useful as it provides control over scrolling\&.)
.PP
Similarly, with any of the `false\&' values (as in `\fBno=10\fP'), menu
completion will \fInot\fP be used if there are \fInum\fP or more matches\&.  
.PP
The value of this widget also controls menu selection, as implemented by
the \fBzsh/complist\fP module\&.  The following values may appear either
alongside or instead of the values above\&.
.PP
If the value contains the string `\fBselect\fP\&', menu selection
will be started unconditionally\&.
.PP
In the form `\fBselect=\fP\fInum\fP\&', menu selection will only be started if
there are at least \fInum\fP matches\&.  If the values for more than one
tag provide a number, the smallest number is taken\&.
.PP
Menu selection can be turned off explicitly by defining a value
containing the string`\fBno\-select\fP\&'\&.
.PP
It is also possible to start menu selection only if the list of
matches does not fit on the screen by using the value
`\fBselect=long\fP\&'\&.  To start menu selection even if the current widget
only performs listing, use the value `\fBselect=long\-list\fP\&'\&.
.PP
To turn on menu completion or menu selection when there are a certain
number of matches \fIor\fP the list of matches does not fit on the
screen, both of `\fByes=\fP\&' and `\fBselect=\fP' may be given twice, once
with a number and once with `\fBlong\fP\&' or `\fBlong\-list\fP'\&.
.PP
Finally, it is possible to activate two special modes of menu selection\&.
The word `\fBinteractive\fP\&' in the value causes interactive mode
to be entered immediately when menu selection is started; see
the description of the \fBzsh/complist\fP module in \fIzshmodules\fP(1)

\fBnumbers\fP
This is used with the \fBjobs\fP tag\&.  If it is `true\&', the shell will
complete job numbers instead of the shortest unambiguous prefix

only be used if that many words from the job descriptions are required to
resolve ambiguities\&.  For example, if the value is `\fB1\fP\&', strings will
only be used if all jobs differ in the first word on their command lines\&.

\fBold\-list\fP
This is used by the \fB_oldlist\fP completer\&.  If it is set to `\fBalways\fP\&',
then standard widgets which perform listing will retain the current list of
matches, however they were generated; this can be turned off explicitly
with the value `\fBnever\fP\&', giving the behaviour without the \fB_oldlist\fP
completer\&.  If the style is unset, or any other value, then the existing
list of completions is displayed if it is not already; otherwise, the
standard completion list is generated; this is the default behaviour of
\fB_oldlist\fP\&.  However, if there is an old list and this style contains
the name of the completer function that generated the list, then the
old list will be used even if it was generated by a widget which does
not do listing\&.
.RS
.PP
For example, suppose you type \fB^Xc\fP to use the \fB_correct_word\fP
widget, which generates a list of corrections for the word under the
cursor\&.  Usually, typing \fB^D\fP would generate a standard list of
completions for the word on the command line, and show that\&.  With
\fB_oldlist\fP, it will instead show the list of corrections already
generated\&.
.PP
As another example consider the \fB_match\fP completer: with the
\fBinsert\-unambiguous\fP style set to `true\&' it inserts only a common prefix
string, if there is any\&.  However, this may remove parts of the original
pattern, so that further completion could produce more matches than on the
first attempt\&.  By using the \fB_oldlist\fP completer and setting this style
to \fB_match\fP, the list of matches generated on the first attempt will be
used again\&.

If this style is set it is generally unwise to call the \fB_all_matches\fP

\fBold\-menu\fP
This is used by the \fB_oldlist\fP completer\&.  It controls how menu
completion behaves when a completion has already been inserted and the

behaviour of \fB_oldlist\fP is that menu completion always continues
with the existing list of completions\&.  If this style is set to
`false\&', however, a new completion is started if the old list was
generated by a different completion command; this is the behaviour without
the \fB_oldlist\fP completer\&.

.PP
For example, suppose you type \fB^Xc\fP to generate a list of corrections,

examines all components of a path to see if there are completions of

\fBseparate\-sections\fP
This style is used with the \fBmanuals\fP tag when completing names of
manual pages\&.  If it is `true\&', entries for different sections are
added separately using tag names of the form `\fBmanuals\&.\fP\fIX\fP\&',

\fBshow\-ambiguity\fP
If the \fBzsh/complist\fP module is loaded, this style can be used to

\fBsingle\-ignored\fP
This is used by the \fB_ignored\fP completer when there is only one match\&.

If set to `true\&', the \fB_history_complete_word\fP bindable

\fBstrip\-comments\fP
If set to `true\&', this style causes non\-essential comment text to be

\fBtag\-order\fP
This provides a mechanism for sorting how the tags available in a
particular context will be used\&.
.RS

The values for the style are sets of space\-separated lists of tags\&.
The tags in each value will be tried at the same time; if no match is
found, the next value is used\&.  (See the \fBfile\-patterns\fP style for
an exception to this behavior\&.)

For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:complete:\-command\-:*:*' tag\-order \e

.fi
.RE
.PP
specifies that completion in command position first offers
external commands and shell functions\&.  Remaining tags will be tried if
no completions are found\&.
.PP
In addition to tag names, each string in the value may take one of the
following forms:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-\fP
If any value consists of only a hyphen,
then \fIonly\fP the tags specified in the other values are
generated\&.  Normally all tags not explicitly selected are tried last
if the specified tags fail to generate any matches\&.  This means 
that a single value consisting only of a single hyphen
turns off completion\&.
.TP
\fB!\fP \fItags\fP\&.\&.\&.
A string starting with an exclamation mark
specifies names of tags that are \fInot\fP to be used\&.  The effect is
the same as if all other possible tags for the context had been
listed\&.
.TP
\fItag\fP\fB:\fP\fIlabel\fP \&.\&.\&.
Here, \fItag\fP is one of the standard tags and \fIlabel\fP is an
arbitrary name\&.  Matches are generated as normal but the name \fIlabel\fP
is used in contexts instead of \fItag\fP\&.  This is not useful in words
starting with \fB!\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
If the \fIlabel\fP starts with a hyphen, the \fItag\fP is prepended to the
\fIlabel\fP to form the name used for lookup\&.  This can be
used to make the completion system try a certain tag more than once,
supplying different style settings for each attempt; see below for an
example\&.
.RE
.TP
\fItag\fP\fB:\fP\fIlabel\fP\fB:\fP\fIdescription\fP
As before, but \fBdescription\fP will replace the `\fB%d\fP\&' in
the value of the \fBformat\fP style instead of the default description
supplied by the completion function\&.  Spaces in the description must
be quoted with a backslash\&.  A `\fB%d\fP\&' appearing
in \fIdescription\fP is replaced with the description given by the
completion function\&.
.PP
In any of the forms above the tag may be a pattern or several
patterns in the form `\fB{\fP\fIpat1\fP\fB,\fP\fIpat2\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP\&'\&.  In this
case all matching tags will be used except 
for any given explicitly in the same string\&.
.PP
One use of these features is to try
one tag more than once, setting other styles differently on
each attempt, but still to use all the other tags without having to
repeat them all\&.  For example, to make completion of function names in
command position ignore all the completion functions starting with an
underscore the first time completion is tried:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:\-command\-:*:*' tag\-order \e 
    \&'functions:\-non\-comp *' functions
zstyle \&':completion:*:functions\-non\-comp' \e 
    ignored\-patterns \&'_*'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
On the first attempt, all tags will be offered but the \fBfunctions\fP tag
will be replaced by \fBfunctions\-non\-comp\fP\&.  The \fBignored\-patterns\fP style 
is set for this tag to exclude functions starting with an underscore\&.
If there are no matches, the second value of the
\fBtag\-order\fP style is used which completes functions using the default
tag, this time presumably including all function names\&.
.PP
The matches for one tag can be split into different groups\&.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' tag\-order \e

With the \fBgroup\-names\fP style set, options beginning with
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&', options beginning with a single `\fB\-\fP' or `\fB+\fP' but

displayed in separate groups with different descriptions\&.
.PP
Another use of patterns is to
try multiple match specifications one after another\&.  The
\fBmatcher\-list\fP style offers something similar, but it is tested very
early in the completion system and hence can\&'t be set for single
commands nor for more specific contexts\&.  Here is how to
try normal completion without any match specification and, if that
generates no matches, try again with case\-insensitive matching, restricting
the effect to arguments of the command \fBfoo\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:foo:*:*' tag\-order '*' '*:\-case'
zstyle \&':completion:*\-case' matcher 'm:{a\-z}={A\-Z}'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
First, all the tags offered when completing after \fBfoo\fP are tried using
the normal tag name\&.  If that generates no matches, the second value of
\fBtag\-order\fP is used, which tries all tags again except that this time
each has \fB\-case\fP appended to its name for lookup of styles\&.  Hence this
time the value for the \fBmatcher\fP style from the second call to \fBzstyle\fP
in the example is used to make completion case\-insensitive\&.
.PP
It is possible to use the \fB\-e\fP option of the \fBzstyle\fP builtin
command to specify conditions for the use of particular tags\&.  For
example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \-e \&'*:\-command\-:*' tag\-order '
    if [[ \-n $PREFIX$SUFFIX ]]; then
      reply=( )
    else

.RE
.PP
Completion in command position will be attempted only if the string
typed so far is not empty\&.  This is tested using the \fBPREFIX\fP
special parameter; see
zshcompwid
for a description of parameters which are special inside completion widgets\&.
Setting \fBreply\fP to an empty array provides the default
behaviour of trying all tags at once; setting it to an
array containing only a hyphen disables the use of all tags and hence of
all completions\&.
.PP
If no \fBtag\-order\fP style has been defined for a context, the strings
`\fB(|*\-)argument\-* (|*\-)option\-* values\fP\&' and `\fBoptions\fP' plus all
tags offered by the completion function will be used to provide a
sensible default behavior that causes arguments (whether normal command
arguments or arguments of options) to be completed before option names for
most commands\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBurls\fP
This is used together with the \fBurls\fP tag by
functions completing URLs\&.
.RS

If the value consists of more than one string, or if the only string
does not name a file or directory, the strings are used as the URLs to
complete\&.

If the value contains only one string which is the name of a normal

Finally, if the only string in the value names a directory, the

If the first argument to \fB_main_complete\fP is a single hyphen, the

This is similar to the basic \fB_complete\fP completer but allows the

This will give correcting completion if and only if
normal completion yields no possible completions\&.  When
corrected completions are found, the completer will normally start
menu completion allowing you to cycle through these strings\&.

This completer uses the tags \fBcorrections\fP and \fBoriginal\fP when
generating the possible corrections and the original string\&.  The

`\fB%e\fP\&' and `\fB%o\fP' which will be replaced by the number of errors
accepted to generate the corrections and the original string,
respectively\&.
.PP
The completer progressively increases the number of errors allowed up to
the limit by the \fBmax\-errors\fP style, hence if a completion is found
with one error, no completions with two errors will be shown, and so on\&.
It modifies the completer name in the context to indicate the number of
errors being tried: on the first try the completer field contains
`\fBapproximate\-1\fP\&', on the second try `\fBapproximate\-2\fP', and so on\&.
.PP
When \fB_approximate\fP is called from another function, the number of
errors to accept may be passed with the \fB\-a\fP option\&.  The argument

Note that this completer (and the \fB_correct\fP completer mentioned

The external command and its arguments are completed as separate arguments
(in a manner appropriate for completing \fB/usr/bin/env\fP)
if there are two or more remaining positional arguments on the command line,
and as a quoted command string (in the manner of \fBsystem(\&.\&.\&.)\fP) otherwise\&.
See also \fB_cmdstring\fP and \fB_precommand\fP\&.

This function takes no arguments\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_cmdstring\fP
Completes an external command as a single argument, as for
\fBsystem(\&.\&.\&.)\fP\&.
.TP
\fB_complete\fP
This completer generates all possible completions in a context\-sensitive
manner, i\&.e\&. using the settings defined with the \fBcompdef\fP function
explained above and the current settings of all special parameters\&.
This gives the normal completion behaviour\&.
.RS
.PP
To complete arguments of commands, \fB_complete\fP uses the utility function
\fB_normal\fP, which is in turn responsible for finding the particular
function; it is described below\&.  Various contexts of the form
\fB\-\fP\fIcontext\fP\fB\-\fP are handled specifically\&. These are all
mentioned above as possible arguments to the \fB#compdef\fP tag\&.
.PP
Before trying to find a function for a specific context, \fB_complete\fP 
checks if the parameter `\fBcompcontext\fP\&' is set\&. Setting
`\fBcompcontext\fP\&' allows the usual completion dispatching to be
overridden which is useful in places such as a function that uses
\fBvared\fP for input\&. If it is set to an array, the elements are taken
to be the possible matches which will be completed using the tag
`\fBvalues\fP\&' and the description `\fBvalue\fP'\&. If it is set to an
associative array, the keys are used as the possible completions and
the values (if non\-empty) are used as descriptions for the matches\&.  If
`\fBcompcontext\fP\&' is set to a string containing colons, it should be of
the form `\fItag\fP\fB:\fP\fIdescr\fP\fB:\fP\fIaction\fP\&'\&.  In this case the
\fItag\fP and \fIdescr\fP give the tag and description to use and the
\fIaction\fP indicates what should be completed in one of the forms
accepted by the \fB_arguments\fP utility function described below\&.
.PP
Finally, if `\fBcompcontext\fP\&' is set to a string without colons, the
value is taken as the name of the context to use and the function
defined for that context will be called\&.  For this purpose, there is a
special context named \fB\-command\-line\-\fP that completes whole command
lines (commands and their arguments)\&.  This is not used by the completion
system itself but is nonetheless handled when explicitly called\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_correct\fP
Generate corrections, but not completions, for the current word; this is
similar to \fB_approximate\fP but will not allow any number of extra
characters at the cursor as that completer does\&.  The effect is
similar to spell\-checking\&.  It is based on \fB_approximate\fP, but the
completer field in the context name is \fBcorrect\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
For example, with:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:::::' completer \e 
       _complete _correct _approximate
zstyle \&':completion:*:correct:::' max\-errors 2 not\-numeric
zstyle \&':completion:*:approximate:::' max\-errors 3 numeric\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
correction will accept up to two errors\&.  If a numeric argument is
given, correction will not be performed, but correcting completion
will be, and will accept as many errors as given by the numeric
argument\&.  Without a numeric argument, first correction and then
correcting completion will be tried, with the first one accepting two
errors and the second one accepting three errors\&.
.PP
When \fB_correct\fP is called as a function, the number of errors to accept
may be given following the \fB\-a\fP option\&.  The argument is in the same
form a values to the \fBaccept\fP style, all in one string\&.
.PP
This completer function is intended to be used without the
\fB_approximate\fP completer or, as in the example, just before
it\&.  Using it after the \fB_approximate\fP completer is useless since
\fB_approximate\fP will at least generate the corrected strings
generated by the \fB_correct\fP completer \-\- and probably more\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_expand\fP
This completer function does not really perform completion, but instead
checks if the word on the command line is eligible for expansion and,
if it is, gives detailed control over how this expansion is done\&.  For
this to happen, the completion system needs to be invoked with
\fBcomplete\-word\fP, not \fBexpand\-or\-complete\fP (the default binding for
\fBTAB\fP), as otherwise the string will be expanded by the shell\&'s
internal mechanism before the completion system is started\&.
Note also this completer should be called before the \fB_complete\fP 
completer function\&.
.RS
.PP
The tags used when generating expansions are \fBall\-expansions\fP for the
string containing all possible expansions, \fBexpansions\fP when adding
the possible expansions as single matches and \fBoriginal\fP when adding
the original string from the line\&.  The order in which these strings are
generated, if at all, can be controlled by the \fBgroup\-order\fP and
\fBtag\-order\fP styles, as usual\&.
.PP
The format string for \fBall\-expansions\fP and for \fBexpansions\fP may
contain the sequence `\fB%o\fP\&' which will be replaced by the original
string from the line\&.
.PP
The kind of expansion to be tried is controlled by the \fBsubstitute\fP,
\fBglob\fP and \fBsubst\-globs\-only\fP styles\&.
.PP
It is also possible to call \fB_expand\fP as a function, in which case the
different modes may be selected with options: \fB\-s\fP for
\fBsubstitute\fP, \fB\-g\fP for \fBglob\fP and \fB\-o\fP for \fBsubst\-globs\-only\fP\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_expand_alias\fP
If the word the cursor is on is an alias, it is expanded and no other
completers are called\&.  The types of aliases which are to be expanded can
be controlled with the styles \fBregular\fP, \fBglobal\fP and \fBdisabled\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
This function is also a bindable command, see
the section `Bindable Commands\&' below\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_extensions\fP
If the cursor follows the string `\fB*\&.\fP\&', filename extensions are
completed\&. The extensions are taken from files in current directory or a
directory specified at the beginning of the current word\&. For exact matches,
completion continues to allow other completers such as \fB_expand\fP to
expand the pattern\&. The standard \fBadd\-space\fP and \fBprefix\-hidden\fP
styles are observed\&.
.TP
\fB_external_pwds\fP
Completes current directories of other zsh processes belonging to the
current user\&.
.RS
.PP
This is intended to be used via \fB_generic\fP, bound to a custom key
combination\&. Note that pattern matching is enabled so matching is
performed similar to how it works with the \fB_match\fP completer\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_history\fP
Complete words from the shell\&'s command  history\&.  This completer 
can be controlled by the \fBremove\-all\-dups\fP, and \fBsort\fP styles as for the
\fB_history_complete_word\fP bindable command, see
the section `Bindable Commands\&' below
and
the section `Completion System Configuration\&' above\&.
.TP
\fB_ignored\fP
The \fBignored\-patterns\fP style can be set to a list of patterns which are
compared against possible completions; matching ones are removed\&.
With this completer those matches can be reinstated, as
if no \fBignored\-patterns\fP style were set\&.  The completer actually
generates its own list of matches; which completers are invoked
is determined in the same way as for the \fB_prefix\fP completer\&.
The \fBsingle\-ignored\fP style is also available as described above\&.
.TP
\fB_list\fP
This completer allows the insertion of matches to be delayed until
completion is attempted a second time without the word on the line
being changed\&.  On the first attempt, only the list of matches will be
shown\&.  It is affected by the styles \fBcondition\fP and \fBword\fP, see
the section `Completion System Configuration\&' above\&.
.TP
\fB_match\fP
This completer is intended to be used after the \fB_complete\fP
completer\&.  It behaves similarly but the string on the command line may
be a pattern to match against trial completions\&.  This gives the effect
of the \fBGLOB_COMPLETE\fP option\&.
.RS
.PP
Normally completion will be performed by taking the pattern from the line,
inserting a `\fB*\fP\&' at the cursor position and comparing the resulting
pattern with the possible completions generated\&.  This can be modified
with the \fBmatch\-original\fP style described above\&.
.PP
The generated matches will be offered in a menu completion unless the
\fBinsert\-unambiguous\fP style is set to `true\&'; see the description above
for other options for this style\&.
.PP
Note that matcher specifications defined globally or used by the
completion functions (the styles \fBmatcher\-list\fP and \fBmatcher\fP) will
not be used\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_menu\fP
This completer was written as simple example function to show how menu
completion can be enabled in shell code\&. However, it has the notable
effect of disabling menu selection which can be useful with
\fB_generic\fP based widgets\&. It should be used as the first completer in
the list\&.  Note that this is independent of the setting of the
\fBMENU_COMPLETE\fP option and does not work with the other menu
completion widgets such as \fBreverse\-menu\-complete\fP, or
\fBaccept\-and\-menu\-complete\fP\&.
.TP
\fB_oldlist\fP
This completer controls how the standard completion widgets behave
when there is an existing list of completions which may have been
generated by a special completion (i\&.e\&. a separately\-bound completion
command)\&.  It allows the ordinary completion keys to continue to use the
list of completions thus generated, instead of producing a new list of
ordinary contextual completions\&.
It should appear in the list of completers before any of
the widgets which generate matches\&.  It uses two styles: \fBold\-list\fP and
\fBold\-menu\fP, see
the section `Completion System Configuration\&' above\&.
.TP
\fB_precommand\fP
Complete an external command in word\-separated arguments, as for
\fBexec\fP and \fB/usr/bin/env\fP\&.
.TP
\fB_prefix\fP
This completer can be used to try completion with the suffix (everything
after the cursor) ignored\&.  In other words, the suffix will not be
considered to be part of the word to complete\&.  The effect is similar
to the \fBexpand\-or\-complete\-prefix\fP command\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fBcompleter\fP style is used to decide which other completers are to
be called to generate matches\&.  If this style is unset, the list of
completers set for the current context is used \-\- except, of course, the
\fB_prefix\fP completer itself\&.  Furthermore, if this completer appears
more than once in the list of completers only those completers not
already tried by the last invocation of \fB_prefix\fP will be called\&.
.PP
For example, consider this global \fBcompleter\fP style:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' completer \e 
    _complete _prefix _correct _prefix:foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here, the \fB_prefix\fP completer tries normal completion but ignoring the
suffix\&.  If that doesn\&'t generate any matches, and neither does
the call to the \fB_correct\fP completer after it, \fB_prefix\fP will 
be called a second time and, now only trying correction with the
suffix ignored\&.  On the second invocation the completer part of the
context appears as `\fBfoo\fP\&'\&.
.PP
To use \fB_prefix\fP as the last resort and try only normal completion
when it is invoked:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*' completer _complete \&.\&.\&. _prefix
zstyle \&':completion::prefix:*' completer _complete\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBadd\-space\fP style is also respected\&.  If it is set to `true\&' then
\fB_prefix\fP will insert a space between the matches generated (if any) 
and the suffix\&.
.PP
Note that this completer is only useful if the
\fBCOMPLETE_IN_WORD\fP option is set; otherwise, the cursor will
be moved to the end of the current word before the completion code is
called and hence there will be no suffix\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_user_expand\fP
This completer behaves similarly to the \fB_expand\fP completer but
instead performs expansions defined by users\&.  The styles \fBadd\-space\fP and
\fBsort\fP styles specific to the \fB_expand\fP completer are usable with
\fB_user_expand\fP in addition to other styles handled more generally by
the completion system\&.  The tag \fBall\-expansions\fP is also available\&.
.RS
.PP
The expansion depends on the array style \fBuser\-expand\fP being defined
for the current context; remember that the context for completers is less
specific than that for contextual completion as the full context has not
yet been determined\&.  Elements of the array may have one of the following
forms:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fB$\fP\fIhash\fP

\fIhash\fP is the name of an associative array\&.  Note this is not a full
parameter expression, merely a \fB$\fP, suitably quoted to prevent immediate
expansion, followed by the name of an associative array\&.  If the trial
expansion word matches a key in \fIhash\fP, the resulting expansion is the
corresponding value\&.
.PP
.TP
\fI_func\fP

\fI_func\fP is the name of a shell function whose name must begin with
\fB_\fP but is not otherwise special to the completion system\&.  The function
is called with the trial word as an argument\&.  If the word is to be
expanded, the function should set the array \fBreply\fP to a list of
expansions\&.  Optionally, it can set \fBREPLY\fP to a word that will
be used as a description for the set of expansions\&.
The return status of the function is irrelevant\&.

.PD
\fB_bash_completions\fP
This function is used by two widgets, \fB_bash_complete\-word\fP and
\fB_bash_list\-choices\fP\&.  It exists to provide compatibility with
completion bindings in bash\&.  The last character of the binding determines
what is completed: `\fB!\fP\&', command names; `\fB$\fP', environment variables;
`\fB@\fP\&', host names; `\fB/\fP', file names; `\fB~\fP' user names\&.  In bash, the
binding preceded by `\fB\ee\fP\&' gives completion, and preceded by `\fB^X\fP'
lists options\&.  As some of these bindings clash with standard zsh
bindings, only `\fB\ee~\fP\&' and `\fB^X~\fP' are bound by default\&.  To add the
rest, the following should be added to \fB\&.zshrc\fP after \fBcompinit\fP has
been run:
.RS

\fB_correct_filename\fP (\fB^XC\fP)
Correct the filename path at the cursor position\&.  Allows up to six errors

standard output\&.
.TP
\fB_correct_word\fP (\fB^Xc\fP)
Performs correction of the current argument using the usual contextual

`\fBcorrect\-word\fP\&' in the \fIfunction\fP field of the context name and
then calls the \fB_correct\fP completer\&.
.TP
\fB_expand_alias\fP (\fB^Xa\fP)
This function can be used as a completer and as a bindable command\&.
It expands the word the cursor is on if it is an alias\&.  The types of
alias expanded can be controlled with the styles \fBregular\fP, \fBglobal\fP

.RS
.PP
When used as a bindable command there is one additional feature that
can be selected by setting the \fBcomplete\fP style to `true\&'\&.  In this
case, if the word is not the name of an alias, \fB_expand_alias\fP tries
to complete the word to a full alias name without expanding it\&.  It
leaves the cursor directly after the completed word so that invoking
\fB_expand_alias\fP once more will expand the now\-complete alias name\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB_expand_word\fP (\fB^Xe\fP)
Performs expansion on the current word:  equivalent to the standard
\fBexpand\-word\fP command, but using the \fB_expand\fP completer\&.  Before
calling it, the \fIfunction\fP field of the context is set to
`\fBexpand\-word\fP\&'\&.

\fB_generic\fP
This function is not defined as a widget and not bound by
default\&.  However, it can be used to define a widget and will then
store the name of the widget in the \fIfunction\fP field of the context 
and call the completion system\&.  This allows custom completion widgets
with their own set of style settings to be defined easily\&.  For example, 
to define a widget that performs normal completion and starts
menu selection:
.RS

.RS
.nf
\fBzle \-C foo complete\-word _generic
bindkey \&'\&.\&.\&.' foo
zstyle \&':completion:foo:*' menu yes select=1\fP

Note in particular that the \fBcompleter\fP style may be set for the context

\fB_most_recent_file\fP (\fB^Xm\fP)
Complete the name of the most recently modified file matching the pattern

\fIN\fP, complete the \fIN\fPth most recently modified file\&.  Note the
completion, if any, is always unique\&.

Successive invocations of the command cycle through all possible sets of
tags\&.

\fB_read_comp\fP (\fB^X^R\fP)
Prompt the user for a string, and use that to perform completion on the

be a set of words beginning `\fB_\fP\&', for example `\fB_files \-/\fP', in which
case the function with any arguments will be called to generate the
completions\&.  Unambiguous parts of the function name will be completed
automatically (normal completion is not available at this point) until a
space is typed\&.
.RS
.PP
Second, any other string will be passed as a set of arguments to
\fBcompadd\fP and should hence be an expression specifying what should
be completed\&.

A very restricted set of editing commands is available when reading the

the line, and `\fB^C\fP\&' and `\fB^G\fP' abort the function, while `\fBRET\fP'
accepts the completion\&.  Note the string is used verbatim as a command
line, so arguments must be quoted in accordance with standard shell rules\&.

Options to \fB_arguments\fP itself must be in separate words, i\&.e\&. \fB\-s \-w\fP,
not \fB\-sw\fP\&.  The options are followed by \fIspec\fPs that describe options and
arguments of the analyzed command\&.  To avoid ambiguity, all
options to \fB_arguments\fP itself may be separated from the \fIspec\fP forms
by a single colon\&.
.PP
The `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'
form is used to intuit \fIspec\fP forms from the help output of the command
being analyzed, and is described in detail below\&.  The \fIopts\fP for the
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' form are otherwise the same options as the first form\&.  Note

\fB$state\fP is to be handled\&.

If an option in a group appears on the command line, it is stored in the

\fISpecifying Multiple Sets of Arguments\fP
.PP
It is possible to specify multiple sets of options and arguments with
the sets separated by single hyphens\&. This differs from groups in that
sets are considered to be mutually exclusive of each other\&.
.PP
Specifications before the first set and from any group are common to
all sets\&. For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_arguments \e 
    \-a \e 
  \- set1 \e 
    \-c \e 
  \- set2 \e 
    \-d \e 
    \&':arg:(x2 y2)'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This defines two sets\&.  When the command line contains the option
`\fB\-c\fP\&', the `\fB\-d\fP' option and the argument will not be considered
possible completions\&.  When it contains `\fB\-d\fP\&' or an argument, the
option `\fB\-c\fP\&' will not be considered\&.  However, after `\fB\-a\fP'
both sets will still be considered valid\&.
.PP
As for groups, the name of a set may appear in exclusion lists, either
alone or preceding a normal option or argument specification\&.
.PP
The completion code has to parse the command line separately for each
set\&. This can be slow so sets should only be used when necessary\&.
A useful alternative is often an option specification with rest\-arguments
(as in `\fB\-foo:*:\&.\&.\&.\fP\&'); here the option \fB\-foo\fP swallows up all
remaining arguments as described by the \fIoptarg\fP definitions\&.
.PP
\fIDeriving \fIspec\fP forms from the help output\fP
.PP
The option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' allows \fB_arguments\fP to work out the names of long
options that support the `\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&' option which is standard in many
GNU commands\&.  The command word is called with the argument
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&' and the output examined for option names\&.  Clearly, it can
be dangerous to pass this to commands which may not support this option as
the behaviour of the command is unspecified\&.
.PP
In addition to options, `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' will try to deduce the
types of arguments available for options when the form
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\fIopt\fP\fB=\fP\fIval\fP\&' is valid\&.  It is also possible to provide
hints by examining the help text of the command and adding \fIhelpspec\fP of
the form `\fIpattern\fP\fB:\fP\fImessage\fP\fB:\fP\fIaction\fP\&'; note that other
\fB_arguments\fP \fIspec\fP forms are not used\&.  The \fIpattern\fP is matched
against the help text for an option, and if it matches the \fImessage\fP and
\fIaction\fP are used as for other argument specifiers\&.  The special case
of `\fB*:\fP\&' means both \fImessage\fP and \fIaction\fP are empty, which has
the effect of causing options having no description in the help output to
be ordered in listings ahead of options that have a description\&.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_arguments \-\- \&'*\e*:toggle:(yes no)' \e 
              \&'*=FILE*:file:_files' \e 
              \&'*=DIR*:directory:_files \-/' \e 
              \&'*=PATH*:directory:_files \-/'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Here, `\fByes\fP\&' and `\fBno\fP' will be completed as the argument of
options whose description ends in a star; file names will be completed for
options that contain the substring `\fB=FILE\fP\&' in the description; and
directories will be completed for options whose description contains
`\fB=DIR\fP\&' or `\fB=PATH\fP'\&.  The last three are in fact the default and so
need not be given explicitly, although it is possible to override the use
of these patterns\&.  A typical help text which uses this feature is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB  \-C, \-\-directory=DIR          change to directory DIR\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
so that the above specifications will cause directories to be completed
after `\fB\-\fP\fB\-directory\fP\&', though not after `\fB\-C\fP'\&.
.PP
Note also that \fB_arguments\fP tries to find out automatically if the
argument for an option is optional\&.  This can be specified explicitly by
doubling the colon before the \fImessage\fP\&.
.PP
If the \fIpattern\fP ends in `\fB(\-)\fP\&', this will be removed from the
pattern and the \fIaction\fP will be used only directly after the
`\fB=\fP\&', not in the next word\&.  This is the behaviour of a normal
specification defined with the form `\fB=\-\fP\&'\&.
.PP
By default, the command (with the option `\fB\-\-help\fP\&') is run after
resetting all the locale categories (except for \fBLC_CTYPE\fP) to `\fBC\fP\&'\&.
If the localized help output is known to work, the option `\fB\-l\fP\&' can
be specified after the `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' so that the command is
run in the current locale\&.
.PP
The `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' can be followed by the option `\fB\-i\fP
\fIpatterns\fP\&' to give patterns for options which are not to be
completed\&.  The patterns can be given as the name of an array parameter
or as a literal list in parentheses\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_arguments \-\- \-i \e 
    "(\-\-(en|dis)able\-FEATURE*)"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will cause completion to ignore the options
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-enable\-FEATURE\fP\&' and `\fB\-\fP\fB\-disable\-FEATURE\fP' (this example is
useful with GNU \fBconfigure\fP)\&.
.PP
The `\fB_arguments \-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' form can also be followed by the option `\fB\-s\fP
\fIpair\fP\&' to describe option aliases\&.  The \fIpair\fP consists of a list
of alternating patterns and corresponding replacements, enclosed in parens
and quoted so that it forms a single argument word in the \fB_arguments\fP
call\&.
.PP
For example, some \fBconfigure\fP\-script help output describes options only
as `\fB\-\fP\fB\-enable\-foo\fP\&', but the script also accepts the negated form
`\fB\-\fP\fB\-disable\-foo\fP\&'\&.  To allow completion of the second form:

\fIMiscellaneous notes\fP
.PP
Finally, note that \fB_arguments\fP generally expects to be the primary
function handling any completion for which it is used\&.  It may have side
effects which change the treatment of any matches added by other functions
called after it\&.  To combine \fB_arguments\fP with other functions, those
functions should be called either before \fB_arguments\fP, as an \fIaction\fP
within a \fIspec\fP, or in handlers for `\fB\->\fP\fIstate\fP\&' actions\&.
.PP
Here is a more general example of the use of \fB_arguments\fP:

.PP
This describes three options: `\fB\-l\fP\&', `\fB\-format\fP', and
`\fB\-copy\fP\&'\&.  The first takes one argument described as `\fIleft
border\fP\&' for which no completion will be offered because of the empty
action\&.  Its argument may come directly after the `\fB\-l\fP\&' or it may be 
given as the next word on the line\&.
.PP
The `\fB\-format\fP\&' option takes one
argument in the next word, described as `\fIpaper size\fP\&' for which
only the strings `\fBletter\fP\&' and `\fBA4\fP' will be completed\&.
.PP
The `\fB\-copy\fP\&' option may appear more than once on the command line and
takes two arguments\&.  The first is mandatory and will be completed as a
filename\&.  The second is optional (because of the second colon before
the description `\fIresolution\fP\&') and will be completed from the strings
`\fB300\fP\&' and `\fB600\fP'\&.
.PP
The last two descriptions say what should be completed as
arguments\&.  The first describes the first argument as a
`\fIpostscript file\fP\&' and makes files ending in `\fBps\fP' or `\fBeps\fP'

This function is used to complete combinations of values,  for example
pairs of hostnames and usernames\&.  The \fIstyle\fP argument gives the style

`\fB\-s "[:@]"\fP\&' in the case of the \fBusers\-hosts\fP style\&.    Each
`\fIfield\fP\fB=\fP\fIpattern\fP\&' specification restricts the
completions which apply to elements of the style with appropriately
matching fields\&.

If no style with the given name is defined for the given tag,

function name of the required field preceded by an
underscore is defined, that function will be called to generate the

The styles listed below are tested in the current context using the

\fBignore\-line\fP, \fBignored\-patterns\fP, \fBgroup\-name\fP and \fBsort\fP\&.
The \fBformat\fP style is first tested for the given \fItag\fP and then for
the \fBdescriptions\fP tag if no value was found, while the remainder are
only tested for the tag given as the first argument\&.  The function also

.PP
The string returned by the \fBformat\fP style (if any) will be modified so
that the sequence `\fB%d\fP\&' is replaced by the \fIdescr\fP given as the third
argument without any leading or trailing white space\&.  If, after
removing the white space, the \fIdescr\fP is the empty string, the format
style will not be used and the options put into the \fIname\fP array will

If \fB_description\fP is called with more than three arguments,
the additional \fIspec\fPs should be of the form `\fIchar\fP\fB:\fP\fIstr\fP\&'\&.

every appearance of `\fB%\fP\fIchar\fP\&' will be replaced by \fIstring\fP\&.
If no additional \fIspec\fPs are given but the description in \fIdescr\fP
conforms to a common form then further escape sequences are set for
elements of that description\&.  These elements correspond to a default
value (`\fB%o\fP\&'), the units (`\fB%m\fP') range of acceptable values
(`\fB%r\fP\&') and the remaining initial part of the description (`\fB%h\fP')\&.
The form the description takes consists of specifying the units and

The options placed in the array \fIname\fP take account of the

`\fB\-J\fP\&', `\fB\-1\fP', or `\fB\-2\fP' is passed to \fB_description\fP, that

options understood by commands that produce a list when passed the
option `\fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP\&'\&.  It is intended to be used as a top\-level
completion function in its own right\&.  For example, to enable option
completion for the commands \fBfoo\fP and \fBbar\fP, use

options will be ignored\&.  This fits in conveniently with the
argument\-passing conventions of actions for \fB_arguments\fP\&.

As an example, consider a command taking the options \fB\-n\fP and

The \fIdescr\fP is used in the same way as the third

generated\&.  This is useful for displaying a help message in places where

The \fBformat\fP style is examined with the \fBmessages\fP tag to find a

If the \fB\-r\fP option is given, no style is used; the \fIdescr\fP is
taken literally as the string to display\&.  This is most useful
when the \fIdescr\fP comes from a pre\-processed argument list

option does not disable the `\fB%\fP\&'\-sequence parsing done by

\fItag\fP to be shown even if there are no matches for that tag\&.  This form
is called by \fB_arguments\fP in the event that there is no action for an
option specification\&.  The tag can be omitted and if so the tag is taken
from the parameter \fB$curtag\fP; this is maintained by the completion

the time this function is called, \fBcompstate[insert]\fP is cleared, so
additional matches generated later are not inserted on the command line\&.

\fB_multi_parts\fP [ \fB\-i\fP ] \fIsep\fP \fIarray\fP
The argument \fIsep\fP is a separator character\&.
The \fIarray\fP may be either the

`\fB(foo bar\fP\fB)\fP\&', a parenthesised list of words separated
by whitespace\&.  The possible completions are the
strings from the array\&.  However, each chunk delimited by \fIsep\fP will be
completed separately\&.  For example, the \fB_tar\fP function uses
`\fB_multi_parts\fP \fB/\fP \fIpatharray\fP\&' to complete partial file paths
from the given array of complete file paths\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB\-i\fP option causes \fB_multi_parts\fP to insert a unique match even
if that requires multiple separators to be inserted\&.  This is not usually
the expected behaviour with filenames, but certain other types of
completion, for example those with a fixed set of possibilities, may be
more suited to this form\&.

labels for a particular tag as described above for the \fBtag\-order\fP

there is it returns status zero, otherwise non\-zero\&.

a call to \fB_tags\fP or \fB_requested\fP\&.

The \fB\-x12VJ\fP options and the first three arguments are passed to the

This is the standard function called to handle completion outside

A second use is to reexamine the command line specified by the \fB$words\fP

For example, the function \fB_precommand\fP, which
completes after precommand specifiers such as \fBnohup\fP, removes the
first word from the \fBwords\fP array, decrements the \fBCURRENT\fP parameter,
then calls `\fB_normal \-p $service\fP\&'\&.  The effect is that

Where a particular suffix represents the default units for a number, it

It is typically helpful for units to be presented in order of magnitude
when completed\&.  To facilitate this, the order in which they are given
is preserved\&.
.PP
When the \fBformat\fP style is looked up with the \fBdescriptions\fP tag or
the tag specified with \fB\-t\fP, the list of suffixes is available as a
`\fB%x\fP\&' escape sequence\&. This is in addition to the usual sequences
documented under the \fBformat\fP style\&. The form this list takes can also
be configured\&. To this end, the \fBformat\fP style is first looked up with
the tag \fBunit\-suffixes\fP\&. The retrieved format is applied to each
suffix in turn and the results are then concatenated to form the
completed list\&. For the \fBunit\-suffixes\fP format, `\fB%x\fP\&' expands to
the individual suffix and `\fB%X\fP\&' to its description\&. \fB%d\fP' indicates
a default suffix and can be used in a condition\&. The index and reverse
index are set in `\fB%i\fP\&' and `\fB%r\fP' respectively and are useful for
text included only with the first and last suffixes in the list\&. So for
example, the following joins the suffixes together as a comma\-separated

The part of the \fIspec\fP before the first colon is the word to be

The optional third part of the \fIspec\fP describes how words following

completion should be performed for it\&.  It returns status zero if the
tag is requested and non\-zero otherwise\&.  The function is typically used
as part of a loop over different tags as follows:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB_tags foo bar baz
while _tags; do
  if _requested foo; then
    \&.\&.\&. # perform completion for foo
  fi
  \&.\&.\&. # test the tags bar and baz in the same way
  \&.\&.\&. # exit loop if matches were generated
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that the test for whether matches were generated is not performed
until the end of the \fB_tags\fP loop\&.  This is so that the user can set
the \fBtag\-order\fP style to specify a set of tags to be completed at the
same time\&.
.PP
If \fIname\fP and \fIdescr\fP are given, \fB_requested\fP calls the
\fB_description\fP function with these arguments together with the options
passed to \fB_requested\fP\&.
.PP
If \fIcommand\fP is given, the \fB_all_labels\fP function will be called
immediately with the same arguments\&.  In simple cases this makes it
possible to perform the test for the tag and the matching in one go\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBlocal expl ret=1
_tags foo bar baz
while _tags; do
  _requested foo expl \&'description' \e 
      compadd foobar foobaz && ret=0

If the \fIcommand\fP is not \fBcompadd\fP, it must nevertheless be prepared

\fB_retrieve_cache\fP \fIcache_identifier\fP
This function retrieves completion information from the file given by
\fIcache_identifier\fP, stored in a directory specified by the
\fBcache\-path\fP style which defaults to \fB~/\&.zcompcache\fP\&.  The return status
is zero if retrieval was successful\&.  It will only attempt retrieval
if the \fBuse\-cache\fP style is set, so you can call this function
without worrying about whether the user wanted to use the caching
layer\&.

\fB_sep_parts\fP
This function is passed alternating arrays and separators as arguments\&.
The arrays specify completions for parts of strings to be separated by the
separators\&.  The arrays may be the names of array parameters or
a quoted list of words in parentheses\&.  For example, with the array
`\fBhosts=(ftp news)\fP\&' the call `\fB_sep_parts '(foo bar)' @ hosts\fP' will
complete the string  `\fBf\fP\&' to `\fBfoo\fP' and the string `\fBb@n\fP' to
`\fBbar@news\fP\&'\&.

\fB_sequence\fP [ \fB\-s\fP \fIsep\fP ] [ \fB\-n\fP \fImax\fP ] [ \fB\-d\fP ] \fIfunction\fP [ \fB\-\fP ] \&.\&.\&.
This function is a wrapper to other functions for completing items in a
separated list\&. The same function is used to complete each item in the
list\&. The separator is specified with the \fB\-s\fP option\&. If \fB\-s\fP is
omitted it will use `\fB,\fP\&'\&. Duplicate values are not matched unless
\fB\-d\fP is specified\&. If there is a fixed or maximum number of items in
the list, this can be specified with the \fB\-n\fP option\&.
.RS

Common \fBcompadd\fP options are passed on to the function\&. It is possible

\fB_setup\fP \fItag\fP [ \fIgroup\fP ]
This function sets up the special
parameters used by the completion system appropriately for the \fItag\fP
given as the first argument\&.  It uses the styles \fBlist\-colors\fP,
\fBlist\-packed\fP, \fBlist\-rows\-first\fP, \fBlast\-prompt\fP, \fBaccept\-exact\fP,
\fBmenu\fP and \fBforce\-list\fP\&.

The optional \fIgroup\fP supplies the name of the group in which the
matches will be placed\&.  If it is not given, the \fItag\fP is used as
the group name\&.

\fB_store_cache\fP \fIcache_identifier\fP \fIparam\fP \&.\&.\&.
This function, together with \fB_retrieve_cache\fP and
\fB_cache_invalid\fP, implements a caching layer which can be used
in any completion function\&.  Data obtained by
costly operations are stored in parameters;
this function then dumps the values of those parameters to a file\&.  The
data can then be retrieved quickly from that file via \fB_retrieve_cache\fP,
even in different instances of the shell\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIcache_identifier\fP specifies the file which the data should be
dumped to\&.  The file is stored in a directory specified by the
\fBcache\-path\fP style which defaults to \fB~/\&.zcompcache\fP\&.  The remaining
\fIparam\fPs arguments are the parameters to dump to the file\&.
.PP
The return status is zero if storage was successful\&.  The function will
only attempt storage if the \fBuse\-cache\fP style is set, so you can
call this function without worrying about whether the user wanted to
use the caching layer\&.
.PP
The completion function may avoid calling \fB_retrieve_cache\fP when it
already has the completion data available as parameters\&. 
However, in that case it should
call \fB_cache_invalid\fP to check whether the data in the parameters and
in the cache are still valid\&.
.PP
See the _perl_modules completion function for a simple example of
the usage of the caching layer\&.
.RE

\fB_tags\fP [ [ \fB\-C\fP \fIname\fP ] \fItag\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
If called with arguments, these are taken to be the names of tags
valid for completions in the current context\&.  These tags are stored
internally and sorted by using the \fBtag\-order\fP style\&.
.RS
.PP
Next, \fB_tags\fP is called repeatedly without arguments from the same
completion function\&.  This successively selects the first, second,
etc\&. set of tags requested by the user\&.  The return status is zero if at
least one of the tags is requested and non\-zero otherwise\&.  To test if a
particular tag is to be tried, the \fB_requested\fP function should be
called (see above)\&.
.PP
If `\fB\-C\fP \fIname\fP\&' is given, \fIname\fP is temporarily stored in the
\fIargument\fP field (the fifth) of the context in the \fBcurcontext\fP parameter
during the call to \fB_tags\fP; the field is restored on exit\&.  This
allows \fB_tags\fP to use a more 
specific context without having to change and reset the
\fBcurcontext\fP parameter (which has the same effect)\&.
.RE

\fB_tilde_files\fP
Like \fB_files\fP, but resolve leading tildes according to the rules of
filename expansion, so the suggested completions don\&'t start with

This is used to complete arbitrary keywords (values) and their arguments,
or lists of such combinations\&.
.RS
.PP
If the first argument is the option `\fB\-O\fP \fIname\fP\&', it will be used
in the same way as by the \fB_arguments\fP function\&.  In other words, the
elements of the \fIname\fP array will be passed to \fBcompadd\fP
when executing an action\&.
.PP
If the first argument (or the first argument after `\fB\-O\fP \fIname\fP\&')
is `\fB\-s\fP\&', the next argument is used as the character that separates
multiple values\&.  This character is automatically added after each value
in an auto\-removable fashion (see below); all values completed by
`\fB_values \-s\fP\&' appear in the same word on the command line, unlike
completion using \fB_arguments\fP\&.  If this option is not present, only a
single value will be completed per word\&.
.PP
Normally, \fB_values\fP will only use the current word to determine
which values are already present on the command line and hence are not
to be completed again\&.  If the \fB\-w\fP option is given, other arguments
are examined as well\&.
.PP
The first non\-option argument, \fIdesc\fP, is used as a string to print as a
description before listing the values\&.
.PP
All other arguments describe the possible values and their
arguments in the same format used for the description of options by
the \fB_arguments\fP function (see above)\&.  The only differences are that
no minus or plus sign is required at the beginning,
values can have only one argument, and the forms of action
beginning with an equal sign are not supported\&.
.PP
The character separating a value from its argument can be set using the
option \fB\-S\fP (like \fB\-s\fP, followed by the character to use as the
separator in the next argument)\&.  By default the equals
sign will be used as the separator between values and arguments\&.

This describes three possible values: `\fBfoo\fP\&', `\fBone\fP', and
`\fBtwo\fP\&'\&.  The first is described as `\fBbar\fP', takes no argument 
and may appear more than once\&.  The second is described as
`\fBnumber\fP\&', may appear more than once, and takes one mandatory
argument described as `\fBfirst count\fP\&'; no action is
specified, so it will not be completed\&.  The
`\fB(two)\fP\&' at the beginning says that if the value `\fBone\fP' is on
the line, the value `\fBtwo\fP\&' will no longer be considered a possible
completion\&.  Finally, the last value (`\fBtwo\fP\&') is described
as `\fBanother number\fP\&' and takes an optional argument described as
`\fBsecond count\fP\&' for which the completions (to appear after an
`\fB=\fP\&') are `\fB1\fP', `\fB2\fP', and `\fB3\fP'\&.  The \fB_values\fP function
will complete lists of these values separated by commas\&.
.PP
Like \fB_arguments\fP, this function temporarily adds another context name
component to the arguments element (the fifth) of the current context
while executing the \fIaction\fP\&.  Here this name is just the name of the
value for which the argument is completed\&.
.PP
The style \fBverbose\fP is used to decide if the descriptions for the
values (but not those for the arguments) should be printed\&.
.PP
The associative array \fBval_args\fP is used to report values and their
arguments; this works similarly to the \fBopt_args\fP associative array
used by \fB_arguments\fP\&.  Hence the function calling \fB_values\fP should
declare the local parameters \fBstate\fP, \fBstate_descr\fP, \fBline\fP,
\fBcontext\fP and \fBval_args\fP:

.PP
when using an action of the form `\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&'\&.  With this
function the \fBcontext\fP parameter will be set to the name of the
value whose argument is to be completed\&.  Note that for \fB_values\fP,
the \fBstate\fP and \fBstate_descr\fP are scalars rather than arrays\&.
Only a single matching state is returned\&.
.PP
Note also that \fB_values\fP normally adds the character used as the
separator between values as an auto\-removable suffix (similar to a
`\fB/\fP\&' after a directory)\&.  However, this is not possible for a
`\fB\->\fP\fIstring\fP\&' action as the matches for the argument are
generated by the calling function\&.  To get the usual behaviour,
the calling function can add the separator \fIx\fP as a suffix by
passing the options `\fB\-qS\fP \fIx\fP\&' either directly or indirectly to
\fBcompadd\fP\&.
.PP
The option \fB\-C\fP is treated in the same way as it is by \fB_arguments\fP\&.
In that case the parameter \fBcurcontext\fP should be made local instead

The arguments to \fB_wanted\fP are the same as those to \fB_requested\fP,
