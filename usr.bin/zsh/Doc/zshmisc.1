.SH "SIMPLE COMMANDS & PIPELINES"
A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional parameter
assignments followed by blank\-separated words,
with optional redirections interspersed\&.  For a description
of assignment, see the beginning of
\fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.
.PP
The first word is the command to be executed, and the remaining
words, if any, are arguments to the command\&.
If a command name is given, the parameter assignments modify
the environment of the command when it is executed\&.
The value of a simple command is its exit status,
or 128 plus the signal number if terminated by a signal\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is a simple command with arguments\&.
.PP
A \fIpipeline\fP is either a simple command, or a sequence of two or more
simple commands where each command is separated from the next by `\fB|\fP\&'
or `\fB|&\fP\&'\&.  Where commands are separated by `\fB|\fP', the standard
output of the first command is connected to the
standard input of the next\&.  `\fB|&\fP\&' is shorthand for `\fB2>&1 |\fP', which
connects both the standard output and the standard error of the
command to the standard input of the next\&.  The value of a pipeline
is the value of the last command, unless the pipeline is preceded by
`\fB!\fP\&' in which case the value is the logical inverse of the value of the
last command\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho foo | sed \&'s/foo/bar/'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is a pipeline, where the output (`\fBfoo\fP\&' plus a newline) of the first
command will be passed to the input of the second\&.
.PP
If a pipeline is preceded by `\fBcoproc\fP\&', it is executed as a coprocess;
a two\-way pipe is established between it and the parent shell\&.  The
shell can read from or write to the coprocess by means of the `\fB>&p\fP\&'
and `\fB<&p\fP\&' redirection operators or with `\fBprint \-p\fP' and `\fBread \-p\fP'\&.
A pipeline cannot be preceded by both `\fBcoproc\fP\&' and `\fB!\fP'\&.
If job control is active, the coprocess can be treated in other than input
and output as an ordinary background job\&.
.PP
A \fIsublist\fP is either a single pipeline, or a sequence of two or more
pipelines separated by `\fB&&\fP\&' or `\fB||\fP'\&.  If two pipelines are separated
by `\fB&&\fP\&', the second pipeline is executed only if the first succeeds
(returns a zero status)\&.  If two pipelines are separated by `\fB||\fP\&', the
second is executed only if the first fails (returns a nonzero status)\&.
Both operators have equal precedence and are left associative\&.
The value of the sublist is the value of the last pipeline executed\&.
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdmesg | grep panic && print yes\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is a sublist consisting of two pipelines, the second just a simple command
which will be executed if and only if the \fBgrep\fP command returns a zero
status\&.  If it does not, the value of the sublist is that return status, else
it is the status returned by the \fBprint\fP (almost certainly zero)\&.
.PP
A \fIlist\fP is a sequence of zero or more sublists, in which each sublist
is terminated by `\fB;\fP\&', `\fB&\fP', `\fB&|\fP', `\fB&!\fP', or a newline\&.
This terminator
may optionally be omitted from the last sublist in the list when the
list appears as a complex command inside `\fB(\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB)\fP\&'
or `\fB{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB}\fP\&'\&.  When a
sublist is terminated by `\fB;\fP\&' or newline, the shell waits for it to
finish before executing the next sublist\&.  If a sublist is terminated
by a `\fB&\fP\&', `\fB&|\fP', or `\fB&!\fP',
the shell executes the last pipeline in it in the background, and
does not wait for it to finish (note the difference from other shells
which execute the whole sublist in the background)\&.
A backgrounded pipeline returns a status of zero\&.
.PP
More generally, a list can be seen as a set of any shell commands
whatsoever, including the complex commands below; this is implied wherever
the word `list\&' appears in later descriptions\&.  For example, the commands
in a shell function form a special sort of list\&.
.SH "PRECOMMAND MODIFIERS"
A simple command may be preceded by a \fIprecommand modifier\fP,
which will alter how the command is interpreted\&.  These modifiers are
shell builtin commands with the exception of \fBnocorrect\fP which is
a reserved word\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-\fP
The command is executed with a `\fB\-\fP\&' prepended to its
\fBargv[0]\fP string\&.
.TP
\fBbuiltin\fP
The command word is taken to be the name of a builtin command,
rather than a shell function or external command\&.
.TP
\fBcommand\fP [ \fB\-pvV\fP ]
The command word is taken to be the name of an external command,
rather than a shell function or builtin\&.   If the \fBPOSIX_BUILTINS\fP option
is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties
of them are suppressed\&. The \fB\-p\fP flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in \fB$path\fP\&. With the \fB\-v\fP flag, \fBcommand\fP
is similar to \fBwhence\fP and with \fB\-V\fP, it is equivalent to \fBwhence
\-v\fP\&.
.TP
\fBexec\fP [ \fB\-cl\fP ] [ \fB\-a\fP \fIargv0\fP ]
The following command together with any arguments is run in place
of the current process, rather than as a sub\-process\&.  The shell does not
fork and is replaced\&.  The shell does not invoke \fBTRAPEXIT\fP, nor does it
source \fBzlogout\fP files\&.
The options are provided for compatibility with other shells\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fB\-c\fP option clears the environment\&.
.PP
The \fB\-l\fP option is equivalent to the \fB\-\fP precommand modifier, to
treat the replacement command as a login shell; the command is executed
with a \fB\-\fP prepended to its \fBargv[0]\fP string\&.  This flag has no effect
if used together with the \fB\-a\fP option\&.
.PP
The \fB\-a\fP option is used to specify explicitly the \fBargv[0]\fP string
(the name of the command as seen by the process itself) to be used by the
replacement command and is directly equivalent to setting a value
for the \fBARGV0\fP environment variable\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBnocorrect\fP
Spelling correction is not done on any of the words\&.  This must appear
before any other precommand modifier, as it is interpreted immediately,
before any parsing is done\&.  It has no effect in non\-interactive shells\&.
.TP
\fBnoglob\fP
Filename generation (globbing) is not performed on any of
the words\&.
.SH "COMPLEX COMMANDS"
A \fIcomplex command\fP in zsh is one of the following:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBif\fP \fIlist\fP \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP [ \fBelif\fP \fIlist\fP \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP ] \&.\&.\&. [ \fBelse\fP \fIlist\fP ] \fBfi\fP
The \fBif\fP \fIlist\fP is executed, and if it returns a zero exit status,
the \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP is executed\&.
Otherwise, the \fBelif\fP \fIlist\fP is executed and if its status is zero,
the \fBthen\fP \fIlist\fP is executed\&.
If each \fBelif\fP \fIlist\fP returns nonzero status, the \fBelse\fP \fIlist\fP
is executed\&.
.TP
\fBfor\fP \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. [ \fBin\fP \fIword\fP \&.\&.\&. ] \fIterm\fP \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdone\fP
Expand the list of \fIword\fPs, and set the parameter
\fIname\fP to each of them in turn, executing \fIlist\fP
each time\&.  If the `\fBin\fP \fIword\fP\&' is omitted,
use the positional parameters instead of the \fIword\fPs\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIterm\fP consists of one or more newline or \fB;\fP
which terminate the \fIword\fPs, and are optional when the
`\fBin\fP \fIword\fP\&' is omitted\&.
.PP
More than one parameter \fIname\fP can appear before the list of
\fIword\fPs\&.  If \fIN\fP \fIname\fPs are given, then on each execution of the
loop the next \fIN\fP \fIword\fPs are assigned to the corresponding
parameters\&.  If there are more \fIname\fPs than remaining \fIword\fPs, the
remaining parameters are each set to the empty string\&.  Execution of the
loop ends when there is no remaining \fIword\fP to assign to the first
\fIname\fP\&.  It is only possible for \fBin\fP to appear as the first \fIname\fP
in the list, else it will be treated as marking the end of the list\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfor ((\fP [\fIexpr1\fP] \fB;\fP [\fIexpr2\fP] \fB;\fP [\fIexpr3\fP] \fB)) do\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdone\fP
The arithmetic expression \fIexpr1\fP is evaluated first (see
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation\&')\&.  The arithmetic expression
\fIexpr2\fP is repeatedly evaluated until it evaluates to zero and
when non\-zero, \fIlist\fP is executed and the arithmetic expression
\fIexpr3\fP evaluated\&.  If any expression is omitted, then it behaves
as if it evaluated to 1\&.
.TP
\fBwhile\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdone\fP
Execute the \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP as long as the \fBwhile\fP \fIlist\fP
returns a zero exit status\&.
.TP
\fBuntil\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdone\fP
Execute the \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP as long as \fBuntil\fP \fIlist\fP
returns a nonzero exit status\&.
.TP
\fBrepeat\fP \fIword\fP \fBdo\fP \fIlist\fP \fBdone\fP
\fIword\fP is expanded and treated as an arithmetic expression,
which must evaluate to a number \fIn\fP\&.
\fIlist\fP is then executed \fIn\fP times\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fBrepeat\fP syntax is disabled by default when the
shell starts in a mode emulating another shell\&.  It can be enabled
with the command `\fBenable \-r repeat\fP\&'
.RE
.TP
\fBcase\fP \fIword\fP \fBin\fP [ [\fB(\fP] \fIpattern\fP [ \fB|\fP \fIpattern\fP ] \&.\&.\&. \fB)\fP \fIlist\fP (\fB;;\fP|\fB;&\fP|\fB;|\fP) ] \&.\&.\&. \fBesac\fP
Execute the \fIlist\fP associated with the first \fIpattern\fP
that matches \fIword\fP, if any\&.  The form of the patterns
is the same as that used for filename generation\&.  See
the section `Filename Generation\&'\&.
.RS
.PP
Note further that, unless the \fBSH_GLOB\fP option is set, the whole
pattern with alternatives is treated by the shell as equivalent to a
group of patterns within parentheses, although white space may appear
about the parentheses and the vertical bar and will be stripped from the
pattern at those points\&.  White space may appear elsewhere in the
pattern; this is not stripped\&.  If the \fBSH_GLOB\fP option is set, so
that an opening parenthesis can be unambiguously treated as part of the
case syntax, the expression is parsed into separate words and these are
treated as strict alternatives (as in other shells)\&.
.PP
If the \fIlist\fP that is executed is terminated with \fB;&\fP rather than
\fB;;\fP, the following list is also executed\&.  The rule for
the terminator of the following list \fB;;\fP, \fB;&\fP or \fB;|\fP is
applied unless the \fBesac\fP is reached\&.
.PP
If the \fIlist\fP that is executed is terminated with \fB;|\fP the
shell continues to scan the \fIpattern\fPs looking for the next match,
executing the corresponding \fIlist\fP, and applying the rule for
the corresponding terminator \fB;;\fP, \fB;&\fP or \fB;|\fP\&.
Note that \fIword\fP is not re\-expanded; all applicable \fIpattern\fPs
are tested with the same \fIword\fP\&.
.RE
.TP

Print the set of \fIword\fPs, each preceded by a number\&.
If the \fBin\fP \fIword\fP is omitted, use the positional parameters\&.
The \fBPROMPT3\fP prompt is printed and a line is read from the line editor
if the shell is interactive and that is active, or else standard input\&.
If this line consists of the
number of one of the listed \fIword\fPs, then the parameter \fIname\fP
is set to the \fIword\fP corresponding to this number\&.
If this line is empty, the selection list is printed again\&.
Otherwise, the value of the parameter \fIname\fP is set to null\&.
The contents of the line read from standard input is saved
in the parameter \fBREPLY\fP\&.  \fIlist\fP is executed
for each selection until a break or end\-of\-file is encountered\&.
.TP
\fB(\fP \fIlist\fP \fB)\fP
Execute \fIlist\fP in a subshell\&.  Traps set by the \fBtrap\fP builtin
are reset to their default values while executing \fIlist\fP; an
exception is that ignored signals will continue to be ignored
if the option \fBPOSIXTRAPS\fP is set\&.

\fB{\fP \fIlist\fP \fB}\fP
Execute \fIlist\fP\&.

First execute \fItry\-list\fP\&.  Regardless of errors, or \fBbreak\fP or
\fBcontinue\fP commands encountered within \fItry\-list\fP,
execute \fIalways\-list\fP\&.  Execution then continues from the
result of the execution of \fItry\-list\fP; in other words, any error,
or \fBbreak\fP or \fBcontinue\fP command is treated in the
normal way, as if \fIalways\-list\fP were not present\&.  The two
chunks of code are referred to as the `try block\&' and the `always block'\&.
.RS
.PP
Optional newlines or semicolons may appear after the \fBalways\fP;
note, however, that they may \fInot\fP appear between the preceding
closing brace and the \fBalways\fP\&.
.PP
An `error\&' in this context is a condition such as a syntax error which
causes the shell to abort execution of the current function, script, or
list\&.  Syntax errors encountered while the shell is parsing the
code do not cause the \fIalways\-list\fP to be executed\&.  For example,
an erroneously constructed \fBif\fP block in \fItry\-list\fP would cause the
shell to abort during parsing, so that \fIalways\-list\fP would not be
executed, while an erroneous substitution such as \fB${*foo*}\fP would
cause a run\-time error, after which \fIalways\-list\fP would be executed\&.
.PP
An error condition can be tested and reset with the special integer
variable \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP\&.  Outside an \fIalways\-list\fP the value is
irrelevant, but it is initialised to \fB\-1\fP\&.  Inside \fIalways\-list\fP, the
value is 1 if an error occurred in the \fItry\-list\fP, else 0\&.  If
\fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP is set to 0 during the \fIalways\-list\fP, the error
condition caused by the \fItry\-list\fP is reset, and shell execution
continues normally after the end of \fIalways\-list\fP\&.  Altering the value
during the \fItry\-list\fP is not useful (unless this forms part of an
enclosing \fBalways\fP block)\&.
.PP
Regardless of \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP, after the end of \fIalways\-list\fP the
normal shell status \fB$?\fP is the value returned from \fItry\-list\fP\&.
This will be non\-zero if there was an error, even if \fBTRY_BLOCK_ERROR\fP
was set to zero\&.
.PP
The following executes the given code, ignoring any errors it causes\&.
This is an alternative to the usual convention of protecting code by
executing it in a subshell\&.
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB{
    # code which may cause an error
  } always {
    # This code is executed regardless of the error\&.
    (( TRY_BLOCK_ERROR = 0 ))
}
# The error condition has been reset\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When a \fBtry\fP block occurs outside of any function, 
a \fBreturn\fP or a \fBexit\fP encountered in \fItry\-list\fP does \fInot\fP cause
the execution of \fIalways\-list\fP\&.  Instead, the shell exits immediately
after any \fBEXIT\fP trap has been executed\&.
Otherwise, a \fBreturn\fP command encountered in \fItry\-list\fP will cause the
execution of \fIalways\-list\fP, just like \fBbreak\fP and \fBcontinue\fP\&.

.SH "ALTERNATE FORMS FOR COMPLEX COMMANDS"
Many of zsh\&'s complex commands have alternate forms\&.  These are

\fBwhile\fP and \fBuntil\fP commands, in both these cases the test part of the

`\fB((\fP \fI\&.\&.\&.\fP \fB))\fP\&',
else the end of the test will not be recognized\&.  For the

for the arguments is necessary, but the other condition (the special form

.SH "ERRORS"
Certain errors are treated as fatal by the shell: in an interactive
shell, they cause control to return to the command line, and in a
non\-interactive shell they cause the shell to be aborted\&.  In older
versions of zsh, a non\-interactive shell running a script would not
abort completely, but would resume execution at the next command to be
read from the script, skipping the remainder of any functions or
shell constructs such as loops or conditions; this somewhat illogical
behaviour can be recovered by setting the option \fBCONTINUE_ON_ERROR\fP\&.

If so, it is replaced by the text of the alias if it is in command
position (if it could be the first word of a simple command),
or if the alias is global\&.
If the replacement text ends with a space, the next word in the shell input
is always eligible for purposes of alias expansion\&.
.PP
It is an error for the function name, \fIword\fP, in the sh\-compatible function
definition syntax `\fIword\fP \fB()\fP \&.\&.\&.\&' to be a word that resulted
from alias expansion, unless the \fBALIAS_FUNC_DEF\fP option is set\&.
.PP
An alias is defined using the \fBalias\fP builtin; global aliases
may be defined using the \fB\-g\fP option to that builtin\&.
.PP
A \fIword\fP is defined as:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\(bu
Any plain string or glob pattern
.TP
\(bu
Any quoted string, using any quoting method (note that the quotes
must be part of the alias definition for this to be eligible)
.TP

Any parameter reference or command substitution
.TP

other tokens between them
.TP

Any reserved word (\fBcase\fP, \fBdo\fP, \fBelse\fP, etc\&.)
.TP
\(bu
With global aliasing, any command separator, any redirection
operator, and `\fB(\fP\&' or `\fB)\fP' when not part of a glob pattern
.PP
Alias expansion is done on the shell input before any other expansion
except history expansion\&.  Therefore, if an alias is defined for the
word \fBfoo\fP, alias expansion may be avoided by quoting part of the
word, e\&.g\&. \fB\efoo\fP\&.  Any form of quoting works, although there is
nothing to prevent an alias being defined for the quoted form such as
\fB\efoo\fP as well\&.
.PP
In particular, note that quoting must be used when using \fBunalias\fP to remove
global aliases:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB% alias \-g foo=bar
% unalias foo
unalias: no such hash table element: bar
% unalias \efoo
% \fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When \fBPOSIX_ALIASES\fP is set, only plain unquoted strings are eligible
for aliasing\&.  The \fBalias\fP builtin does not reject ineligible aliases,
but they are not expanded\&.
.PP
For use with completion, which would remove an initial backslash followed
by a character that isn\&'t special, it may be more convenient to quote the
word by starting with a single quote, i\&.e\&. \fB\&'foo\fP; completion will
automatically add the trailing single quote\&.
.PP
.SS "Alias difficulties"
.PP
Although aliases can be used in ways that bend normal shell syntax, not
every string of non\-white\-space characters can be used as an alias\&.
.PP
Any set of characters not listed as a word above is not a word, hence no
attempt is made to expand it as an alias, no matter how it is defined
(i\&.e\&. via the builtin or the special parameter \fBaliases\fP described in
the section THE ZSH/PARAMETER MODULE in \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.
However, as noted in the case of \fBPOSIX_ALIASES\fP above, the shell does
not attempt to deduce whether the string corresponds to a word at the
time the alias is created\&.
.PP
For example, an expression containing an \fB=\fP at the start of
a command line is an assignment and cannot be expanded as an alias;
a lone \fB=\fP is not an assignment but can only be set as an alias
using the parameter, as otherwise the \fB=\fP is taken part of the
syntax of the builtin command\&.
.PP
It is not presently possible to alias the `\fB((\fP\&' token that
introduces arithmetic expressions, because until a full statement has been
parsed, it cannot be distinguished from two consecutive `\fB(\fP\&'
tokens introducing nested subshells\&.
Also, if a separator such as \fB&&\fP is aliased,
\fB\e&&\fP turns into the two tokens \fB\e&\fP and \fB&\fP, each of which may
have been aliased separately\&.  Similarly for \fB\e<<\fP, \fB\e>|\fP, etc\&.
.PP
There is a commonly encountered problem with aliases
illustrated by the following code:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias echobar=\&'echo bar'; echobar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This prints a message that the command \fBechobar\fP could not be found\&.
This happens because aliases are expanded when the code is read in;
the entire line is read in one go, so that when \fBechobar\fP is executed it
is too late to expand the newly defined alias\&.  This is often
a problem in shell scripts, functions, and code executed with `\fBsource\fP\&'
or `\fB\&.\fP\&'\&.  Consequently, use of functions rather than aliases is
recommended in non\-interactive code\&.
.PP
.SH "QUOTING"
A character may be \fIquoted\fP (that is, made
to stand for itself) by preceding it with a `\fB\e\fP\&'\&.
`\fB\e\fP\&' followed by a newline is ignored\&.
.PP
A string enclosed between `\fB$\&'\fP' and `\fB'\fP' is
processed the same way as the string arguments of the
\fBprint\fP builtin, and the resulting string is considered to be
entirely quoted\&.  A literal `\fB\&'\fP' character can be included in the
string by using the `\fB\e\&'\fP' escape\&.
.PP
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quotes (\fB\&''\fP) that
is not preceded by a `\fB$\fP\&' are quoted\&.  A single quote cannot appear
within single quotes unless the option \fBRC_QUOTES\fP is set, in which case
a pair of single quotes are turned into a single quote\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint \&''''\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP

single quote if it is set\&.
.PP
Inside double quotes (\fB""\fP), parameter and
command substitution occur, and `\fB\e\fP\&' quotes the characters
`\fB\e\fP\&', `\fB`\fP', `\fB"\fP', `\fB$\fP', and the first character
of \fB$histchars\fP (default `\fB!\fP\&')\&.

If one of the above is preceded by a digit, then the file
descriptor referred to is that specified by the digit
instead of the default 0 or 1\&.
The order in which redirections are specified is significant\&.
The shell evaluates each redirection in terms of the
(\fIfile descriptor\fP, \fIfile\fP)
association at the time of evaluation\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\&.\&.\&. \fB1>\fP\fIfname\fP \fB2>&1\fP

.RE
.PP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file \fIfname\fP\&.
It then associates file descriptor 2 with the file associated with file
descriptor 1 (that is, \fIfname\fP)\&.
If the order of redirections were reversed,
file descriptor 2 would be associated
with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been)
and then file descriptor 1 would be associated with file \fIfname\fP\&.

The `\fB|&\fP\&' command separator described in

and `\fB=(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&' for input and
`\fB>(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&' for output, are often used together with
redirection\&.  For example, if \fIword\fP in an output redirection is of the

command represented by \fIlist\fP\&.  See

.SH "OPENING FILE DESCRIPTORS USING PARAMETERS"
.PP
When the shell is parsing arguments to a command, and the shell option
\fBIGNORE_BRACES\fP is not set, a different form of redirection is allowed:
instead of a digit before the operator there is a valid shell identifier
enclosed in braces\&.  The shell will open a new file descriptor that
is guaranteed to be at least 10 and set the parameter named by the
identifier to the file descriptor opened\&.  No whitespace is allowed
between the closing brace and the redirection character\&.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\&.\&.\&. \fB{myfd}>&1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This opens a new file descriptor that is a duplicate of file descriptor
1 and sets the parameter \fBmyfd\fP to the number of the file descriptor,
which will be at least 10\&.  The new file descriptor can be written to using
the syntax \fB>&$myfd\fP\&.  The file descriptor remains open in subshells
and forked external executables\&.
.PP
The syntax \fB{\fP\fIvarid\fP\fB}>&\-\fP, for example \fB{myfd}>&\-\fP, may be used
to close a file descriptor opened in this fashion\&.  Note that the
parameter given by \fIvarid\fP must previously be set to a file descriptor
in this case\&.
.PP
It is an error to open or close a file descriptor in this fashion when the
parameter is readonly\&.  However, it is not an error to read or write a file
descriptor using \fB<&$\fP\fIparam\fP or \fB>&$\fP\fIparam\fP if \fIparam\fP is
readonly\&.
.PP
If the option \fBCLOBBER\fP is unset, it is an error to open a file
descriptor using a parameter that is already set to an open file descriptor
previously allocated by this mechanism\&.  Unsetting the parameter before
using it for allocating a file descriptor avoids the error\&.
.PP
Note that this mechanism merely allocates or closes a file descriptor; it
does not perform any redirections from or to it\&.  It is usually convenient
to allocate a file descriptor prior to use as an argument to \fBexec\fP\&.
The syntax does not in any case work when used around complex commands
such as parenthesised subshells or loops, where the opening brace is
interpreted as part of a command list to be executed in the current shell\&.
.PP
The following shows a typical sequence of allocation, use, and closing of a
file descriptor:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBinteger myfd
exec {myfd}>~/logs/mylogfile\&.txt
print This is a log message\&. >&$myfd
exec {myfd}>&\-\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that the expansion of the variable in the expression \fB>&$myfd\fP
occurs at the point the redirection is opened\&.  This is after the expansion
of command arguments and after any redirections to the left on the command
line have been processed\&.
.SH "MULTIOS"
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for writing more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
its input to all the specified outputs, similar to \fBtee\fP,
provided the \fBMULTIOS\fP option is set, as it is by default\&.  Thus:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdate >foo >bar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
writes the date to two files, named `\fBfoo\fP\&' and `\fBbar\fP'\&.
Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdate >foo | cat\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
writes the date to the file `\fBfoo\fP\&', and also pipes it to cat\&.
.PP
Note that the shell opens all the files to be used in the multio process
immediately, not at the point they are about to be written\&.
.PP
Note also that redirections are always expanded in order\&.  This happens
regardless of the setting of the \fBMULTIOS\fP option, but with the option
in effect there are additional consequences\&. For example,
the meaning of the expression \fB>&1\fP will change after a previous
redirection:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdate >&1 >output\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In the case above, the \fB>&1\fP refers to the standard output at the
start of the line; the result is similar to the \fBtee\fP command\&.
However, consider:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBdate >output >&1\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
As redirections are evaluated in order, when the \fB>&1\fP is encountered
the standard output is set to the file \fBoutput\fP and another copy of
the output is therefore sent to that file\&.  This is unlikely to be what
is intended\&.
.PP
If the \fBMULTIOS\fP
option is set, the word after a redirection operator is also subjected
to filename generation (globbing)\&.  Thus
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB: > *\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will truncate all files in the current directory,
assuming there\&'s at least one\&.  (Without the \fBMULTIOS\fP
option, it would create an empty file called `\fB*\fP\&'\&.)
Similarly, you can do
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho exit 0 >> *\&.sh\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If the user tries to open a file descriptor for reading more than once,
the shell opens the file descriptor as a pipe to a process that copies
all the specified inputs to its output in the order specified, provided
the \fBMULTIOS\fP option is set\&.  It should be noted that each file is
opened immediately, not at the point where it is about to be read:
this behaviour differs from \fBcat\fP, so if strictly standard behaviour
is needed, \fBcat\fP should be used instead\&.
.PP
Thus
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsort <foo <fubar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
or even
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsort <f{oo,ubar}\fP

is equivalent to `\fBcat foo fubar | sort\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Expansion of the redirection argument occurs at the point the redirection
is opened, at the point described above for the expansion of the variable

.PP
Note that a pipe is an implicit redirection; thus
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcat bar | sort <foo\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
is equivalent to `\fBcat bar foo | sort\fP\&' (note the order of the inputs)\&.
.PP
If the \fBMULTIOS\fP option is \fIun\fPset,
each redirection replaces the previous redirection for that file descriptor\&.
However, all files redirected to are actually opened, so
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBecho Hello > bar > baz\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
when \fBMULTIOS\fP is unset will truncate `\fBbar\fP\&', and write `\fBHello\fP'
into `\fBbaz\fP\&'\&.
.PP
There is a problem when an output multio is attached to an external
program\&.  A simple example shows this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBcat file >file1 >file2
cat file1 file2\fP

.RE
.PP
Here, it is possible that the second `\fBcat\fP\&' will not display the full
contents of \fBfile1\fP and \fBfile2\fP (i\&.e\&. the original contents of
\fBfile\fP repeated twice)\&.
.PP
The reason for this is that the multios are spawned after the \fBcat\fP
process is forked from the parent shell, so the parent shell does not
wait for the multios to finish writing data\&.  This means the command as
shown can exit before \fBfile1\fP and \fBfile2\fP are completely written\&.
As a workaround, it is possible to run the \fBcat\fP process as part of a
job in the current shell:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB{ cat file } >file >file2\fP

.PP
A function can be marked as \fIundefined\fP using the \fBautoload\fP builtin
(or `\fBfunctions \-u\fP\&' or `\fBtypeset \-fu\fP')\&.  Such a function has no
body\&.  When the function is first executed, the shell searches for its
definition using the elements of the \fBfpath\fP variable\&.  Thus to define
functions for autoloading, a typical sequence is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfpath=(~/myfuncs $fpath)
autoload myfunc1 myfunc2 \&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The usual alias expansion during reading will be suppressed if the

recommended for the use of functions supplied with the zsh distribution\&.
Note that for functions precompiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin command
the flag \fB\-U\fP must be provided when the \fB\&.zwc\fP file is created, as the
corresponding information is compiled into the latter\&.
.PP
For each \fIelement\fP in \fBfpath\fP, the shell looks for three possible
files, the newest of which is used to load the definition for the function:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fIelement\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP
A file created with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin command, which is expected to
contain the definitions for all functions in the directory named
\fIelement\fP\&.  The file is treated in the same manner as a directory
containing files for functions and is searched for the definition of the
function\&.   If the definition is not found, the search for a definition
proceeds with the other two possibilities described below\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIelement\fP already includes a \fB\&.zwc\fP extension (i\&.e\&. the extension
was explicitly given by the user), \fIelement\fP is searched for the
definition of the function without comparing its age to that of other
files; in fact, there does not need to be any directory named \fIelement\fP
without the suffix\&.  Thus including an element such as
`\fB/usr/local/funcs\&.zwc\fP\&' in \fBfpath\fP will speed up the search for
functions, with the disadvantage that functions included must be explicitly
recompiled by hand before the shell notices any changes\&.
.RE
.TP
\fIelement\fP\fB/\fP\fIfunction\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP
A file created with \fBzcompile\fP, which is expected to contain the
definition for \fIfunction\fP\&.  It may include other function definitions
as well, but those are neither loaded nor executed; a file found in this
way is searched \fIonly\fP for the definition of \fIfunction\fP\&.
.TP
\fIelement\fP\fB/\fP\fIfunction\fP
A file of zsh command text, taken to be the definition for \fIfunction\fP\&.
.PP
In summary, the order of searching is, first, in the \fIparents of\fP
directories in \fBfpath\fP for the newer of either a compiled directory or
a directory in \fBfpath\fP; second, if more than one of these contains a
definition for the function that is sought, the leftmost in the \fBfpath\fP
is chosen; and third, within a directory, the newer of either a compiled
function or an ordinary function definition is used\&.
.PP
If the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option is set, or the file contains only a
simple definition of the function, the file\&'s contents will be executed\&.
This will normally define the function in question, but may also perform
initialization, which is executed in the context of the function execution,
and may therefore define local parameters\&.  It is an error if the function
is not defined by loading the file\&.
.PP
Otherwise, the function body (with no surrounding `\fIfuncname\fP\fB()
{\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP\&') is taken to be the complete contents of the file\&.  This
form allows the file to be used directly as an executable shell script\&.  If
processing of the file results in the function being re\-defined, the
function itself is not re\-executed\&.  To force the shell to perform
initialization and then call the function defined, the file should contain
initialization code (which will be executed then discarded) in addition to
a complete function definition (which will be retained for subsequent calls
to the function), and a call to the shell function, including any
arguments, at the end\&.
.PP
For example, suppose the autoload file \fBfunc\fP contains
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfunc() { print This is func; }
print func is initialized\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
then `\fBfunc; func\fP\&' with \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP set will produce both messages
on the first call, but only the message `\fBThis is func\fP\&' on the second
and subsequent calls\&.  Without \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP set, it will produce
the initialization message on the first call, and the other message on the
second and subsequent calls\&.
.PP
It is also possible to create a function that is not marked as autoloaded,
but which loads its own definition by searching \fBfpath\fP, by using
`\fBautoload \-X\fP\&' within a shell function\&.  For example, the following are
equivalent:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmyfunc() {
  autoload \-X
}
myfunc args\&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunfunction myfunc   # if myfunc was defined
autoload myfunc
myfunc args\&.\&.\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In fact, the \fBfunctions\fP command outputs `\fBbuiltin autoload \-X\fP\&' as
the body of an autoloaded function\&.  This is done so that
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBeval "$(functions)"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
produces a reasonable result\&.  A true autoloaded function can be
identified by the presence of the comment `\fB# undefined\fP\&' in the body,
because all comments are discarded from defined functions\&.
.PP
To load the definition of an autoloaded function \fBmyfunc\fP without
executing \fBmyfunc\fP, use:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload +X myfunc\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SH "ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS"
.PP
If no name is given for a function, it is `anonymous\&' and is handled
specially\&.  Either form of function definition may be used: a `\fB()\fP\&' with
no preceding name, or a `\fBfunction\fP\&' with an immediately following open
brace\&.  The function is executed immediately at the point of definition and
is not stored for future use\&.  The function name is set to `\fB(anon)\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Arguments to the function may be specified as words following the
closing brace defining the function, hence if there are none no
arguments (other than \fB$0\fP) are set\&.  This is a difference from the
way other functions are parsed: normal function definitions may be
followed by certain keywords such as `\fBelse\fP\&' or `\fBfi\fP', which will
be treated as arguments to anonymous functions, so that a newline or
semicolon is needed to force keyword interpretation\&.
.PP
Note also that the argument list of any enclosing script or function is
hidden (as would be the case for any other function called at this
point)\&.
.PP
Redirections may be applied to the anonymous function in the same manner as
to a current\-shell structure enclosed in braces\&.  The main use of anonymous
functions is to provide a scope for local variables\&.  This is particularly
convenient in start\-up files as these do not provide their own local
variable scope\&.
.PP
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBvariable=outside
function {
  local variable=inside
  print "I am $variable with arguments $*"
} this and that
print "I am $variable"\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBI am inside with arguments this and that
I am outside\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that function definitions with arguments that expand to nothing,
for example `\fBname=; function $name { \fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB }\fP\&', are not
treated as anonymous functions\&.  Instead, they are treated as normal
function definitions where the definition is silently discarded\&.
.PP
.SH "SPECIAL FUNCTIONS"
Certain functions, if defined, have special meaning to the shell\&.
.PP
.SS "Hook Functions"
.PP
For the functions below, it is possible to define an array that has the
same name as the function with `\fB_functions\fP\&' appended\&.  Any element in
such an array is taken as the name of a function to execute; it is executed
in the same context and with the same arguments and same initial value of \fB$?\fP
as the basic function\&.  For
example, if \fB$chpwd_functions\fP is an array containing the values
`\fBmychpwd\fP\&', `\fBchpwd_save_dirstack\fP', then the shell attempts to
execute the functions `\fBchpwd\fP\&', `\fBmychpwd\fP' and
`\fBchpwd_save_dirstack\fP\&', in that order\&.  Any function that does not exist
is silently ignored\&.  A function found by this mechanism is referred to
elsewhere as a \fIhook function\fP\&.  An error in any function causes subsequent
functions not to be run\&.  Note further that an error in a \fBprecmd\fP hook
causes an immediately following \fBperiodic\fP function not to run (though
it may run at the next opportunity)\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBchpwd\fP
Executed whenever the current working directory is changed\&.
.TP
\fBperiodic\fP
If the parameter \fBPERIOD\fP
is set, this function is executed every \fB$PERIOD\fP
seconds, just before a prompt\&.  Note that if multiple functions
are defined using the array \fBperiodic_functions\fP only one
period is applied to the complete set of functions, and the
scheduled time is not reset if the list of functions is altered\&.
Hence the set of functions is always called together\&.
.TP
\fBprecmd\fP
Executed before each prompt\&.  Note that precommand functions are not
re\-executed simply because the command line is redrawn, as happens, for
example, when a notification about an exiting job is displayed\&.
.TP
\fBpreexec\fP
Executed just after a command has been read and is about to be
executed\&.  If the history mechanism is active (regardless of whether the
line was discarded from the history buffer), the string that the user
typed is passed as the first argument, otherwise it is an empty string\&.
The actual command that will be executed (including expanded aliases) is
passed in two different forms: the second argument is a single\-line,
size\-limited version of the command (with things like function bodies
elided); the third argument contains the full text that is being
executed\&.
.TP
\fBzshaddhistory\fP
Executed when a history line has been read interactively, but
before it is executed\&.  The sole argument is the complete history
line (so that any terminating newline will still be present)\&.
.RS
.PP
If any of the hook functions returns status 1 (or any non\-zero value
other than 2, though this is not guaranteed for future versions of the
shell) the history line will not be saved, although it lingers in the
history until the next line is executed, allowing you to reuse or edit
it immediately\&.
.PP
If any of the hook functions returns status 2 the history line
will be saved on the internal history list, but not written to
the history file\&.  In case of a conflict, the first non\-zero status
value is taken\&.
.PP
A hook function may call `\fBfc \-p\fP \fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\&' to switch the history
context so that the history is saved in a different file from
that in the global \fBHISTFILE\fP parameter\&.  This is handled specially:
the history context is automatically restored after the processing
of the history line is finished\&.
.PP
The following example function works with one of the options
\fBINC_APPEND_HISTORY\fP or \fBSHARE_HISTORY\fP set, in order that the line
is written out immediately after the history entry is added\&.  It first
adds the history line to the normal history with the newline stripped,
which is usually the correct behaviour\&.  Then it switches the history
context so that the line will be written to a history file in the
current directory\&.

\fBTRAPEXIT\fP, it is not called when functions exit\&.

\fBTRAP\fP\fINAL\fP
If defined and non\-null,
this function will be executed whenever the shell
catches a signal \fBSIG\fP\fINAL\fP, where \fINAL\fP is a signal
name as specified for the \fBkill\fP builtin\&.
The signal number will be passed as the first parameter to the function\&.
.RS
.PP
If a function of this form is defined and null,
the shell and processes spawned by it will ignore \fBSIG\fP\fINAL\fP\&.
.PP
The return status from the function is handled specially\&.  If it is
zero, the signal is assumed to have been handled, and execution continues
normally\&.  Otherwise, the shell will behave as interrupted except that
the return status of the trap is retained\&.
.PP
Programs terminated by uncaught signals typically return the status 128
plus the signal number\&.  Hence the following causes the handler for
\fBSIGINT\fP to print a message, then mimic the usual effect of the signal\&.

If the option \fBDEBUG_BEFORE_CMD\fP is set (as it is by default), executed
before each command; otherwise executed after each command\&.  See
the description of the \fBtrap\fP builtin in
\fIzshbuiltins\fP(1) for details of additional features provided
in debug traps\&.
.TP
\fBTRAPEXIT\fP
Executed when the shell exits,
or when the current function exits if defined inside a function\&.
The value of \fB$?\fP at the start of execution is the exit status of the
shell or the return status of the function exiting\&.
.TP
\fBTRAPZERR\fP
Executed whenever a command has a non\-zero exit status\&.  However, the
function is not executed if the command occurred in a sublist followed by
`\fB&&\fP\&' or `\fB||\fP'; only the final command in a sublist of this type
causes the trap to be executed\&.  The function \fBTRAPERR\fP acts the same as
\fBTRAPZERR\fP on systems where there is no \fBSIGERR\fP (this is the usual
case)\&.
.PP
The functions beginning `\fBTRAP\fP\&' may alternatively be defined with the
\fBtrap\fP builtin:  this may be preferable for some uses\&.  Setting a trap

.SH "JOBS"
If the \fBMONITOR\fP option is set,
an interactive shell associates a \fIjob\fP with each pipeline\&.
It keeps a table of current jobs, printed by the \fBjobs\fP
command, and assigns them small integer numbers\&.
When a job is started asynchronously with `\fB&\fP\&',
the shell prints a line to standard error which looks like:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[1] 1234\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
indicating that the job which was started asynchronously was job number
1 and had one (top\-level) process, whose process ID was 1234\&.
.PP
If a job is started with `\fB&|\fP\&' or `\fB&!\fP',
then that job is immediately disowned\&.  After startup, it
does not have a place in the job table, and is not subject
to the job control features described here\&.
.PP
If you are running a job and wish to do something else you may hit the key
^Z (control\-Z) which sends a \fBTSTP\fP signal to the current job:  this key
may be redefined by the \fBsusp\fP option of the external \fBstty\fP command\&.
The shell will then normally indicate that the job has been `suspended\&',
and print another prompt\&.  You can then manipulate the state of this job,
putting it in the background with the \fBbg\fP command, or run some other
commands and then eventually bring the job back into the foreground with
the foreground command \fBfg\fP\&.  A ^Z takes effect immediately and
is like an interrupt in that pending output and unread input are discarded
when it is typed\&.
.PP
A job being run in the background will suspend if it tries to read
from the terminal\&.
.PP
Note that if the job running in the foreground is a shell function,
then suspending it will have the effect of causing the shell to fork\&.
This is necessary to separate the function\&'s state from that of the
parent shell performing the job control, so that the latter can return
to the command line prompt\&.  As a result, even if \fBfg\fP is
used to continue the job the function will no longer be part of the
parent shell, and any variables set by the function will not be visible
in the parent shell\&.  Thus the behaviour is different from the case
where the function was never suspended\&.  Zsh is different from many
other shells in this regard\&.
.PP
One additional side effect is that use of \fBdisown\fP with a job
created by suspending shell code in this fashion is delayed: the
job can only be disowned once any process started from the parent
shell has terminated\&.  At that point, the disowned job disappears
silently from the job list\&.
.PP
The same behaviour is found when the shell is executing code as the
right hand side of a pipeline or any complex shell construct such as
\fBif\fP, \fBfor\fP, etc\&., in order that the entire block of code
can be managed as a single job\&.
Background jobs are normally allowed to produce output,
but this can be disabled by giving the command `\fBstty tostop\fP\&'\&.
If you set this
tty option, then background jobs will suspend when they try to produce
output like they do when they try to read input\&.
.PP
When a command is suspended and continued later with the \fBfg\fP or
\fBwait\fP builtins, zsh restores tty modes that were in effect when it was
suspended\&.  This (intentionally) does not apply if the command is
continued via `\fBkill \-CONT\fP\&', nor when it is continued with \fBbg\fP\&.
.PP
There are several ways to refer to jobs in the shell\&.
A job can be referred to by the process ID of any process of the job
or by one of the following:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fB%\fP\fInumber\fP
The job with the given number\&.
.TP
\fB%\fP\fIstring\fP
The last job whose command line begins with \fIstring\fP\&.
.TP
\fB%?\fP\fIstring\fP
The last job whose command line contains \fIstring\fP\&.
.TP
\fB%%\fP
Current job\&.
.TP
\fB%+\fP
Equivalent to `\fB%%\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fB%\-\fP
Previous job\&.
.PD
.PP
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state\&.
It normally informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that
no further progress is possible\&.  If the \fBNOTIFY\fP option is not set,
it waits until just before it prints a prompt before it informs you\&.
All such notifications are sent directly to the terminal, not to
the standard output or standard error\&.
.PP
When the monitor mode is on, each background job that completes
triggers any trap set for \fBCHLD\fP\&.
.PP
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are running or suspended, you will
be warned that `You have suspended (running) jobs\&'\&.
You may use the \fBjobs\fP command to see what they are\&.
If you do this or immediately try to
exit again, the shell will not warn you a second time; the suspended
jobs will be terminated, and the running jobs will be sent
a \fBSIGHUP\fP signal, if the \fBHUP\fP option is set\&.
.PP
To avoid having the shell terminate the running jobs, either
use the \fInohup\fP(1) command
or the \fBdisown\fP builtin\&.
.SH "SIGNALS"
The \fBINT\fP and \fBQUIT\fP signals for an invoked
command are ignored if the command is followed by
`\fB&\fP\&' and the \fBMONITOR\fP option is not active\&.
The shell itself always ignores the \fBQUIT\fP signal\&.
Otherwise, signals have the values
inherited by the shell from its parent
(but see the \fBTRAP\fP\fINAL\fP special functions in the section `Functions\&')\&.
.PP
Certain jobs are run asynchronously by the shell other than those
explicitly put into the background; even in cases where the shell
would usually wait for such jobs, an explicit \fBexit\fP command
or exit due to the option \fBERR_EXIT\fP will cause the shell to
exit without waiting\&.  Examples of such asynchronous jobs are
process substitution, see
the section PROCESS SUBSTITUTION in the \fIzshexpn\fP(1) manual page, and the handler processes for
multios, see
the section MULTIOS in the \fIzshmisc\fP(1) manual page\&.
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/arith.yo
.SH "ARITHMETIC EVALUATION"
The shell can perform integer and floating point arithmetic, either using
the builtin \fBlet\fP, or via a substitution of the form
\fB$((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&.  For
integers, the shell is usually compiled to use 8\-byte precision where this
is available, otherwise precision is 4 bytes\&.  This can be tested, for
example, by giving the command `\fBprint \- $(( 12345678901 ))\fP\&'; if the
number appears unchanged, the precision is at least 8 bytes\&.  Floating
point arithmetic always uses the `double\&' type with whatever corresponding
precision is provided by the compiler and the library\&.
.PP
The \fBlet\fP builtin command takes arithmetic expressions as arguments; each
is evaluated separately\&.  Since many of the arithmetic operators, as well
as spaces, require quoting, an alternative form is provided: for any
command which begins with a `\fB((\fP\&', all the characters until a
matching `\fB))\fP\&' are treated as a double\-quoted expression and
arithmetic expansion performed as for an argument of \fBlet\fP\&.  More
precisely, `\fB((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&' is equivalent to
`\fBlet "\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB"\fP\&'\&.  The return status is 0 if the arithmetic value
of the expression is non\-zero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an error occurred\&.
.PP
For example, the following statement
.PP
.RS

Integers can be in bases other than 10\&.
A leading `\fB0x\fP\&' or `\fB0X\fP' denotes hexadecimal and a leading
`\fB0b\fP\&' or `\fB0B\fP' binary\&.
Integers may also be of the form `\fIbase\fP\fB#\fP\fIn\fP\&',
where \fIbase\fP is a decimal number between two and thirty\-six
representing the arithmetic base and \fIn\fP
is a number in that base (for example, `\fB16#ff\fP\&' is 255 in hexadecimal)\&.
The \fIbase\fP\fB#\fP may also be omitted, in which case
base 10 is used\&.  For backwards compatibility the form
`\fB[\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP\fIn\fP\&' is also accepted\&.
.PP
An integer expression or a base given in the form
`\fIbase\fP\fB#\fP\fIn\fP\&' may contain underscores (`\fB_\fP') after the
leading digit for visual guidance; these are ignored in computation\&.
Examples are \fB1_000_000\fP or \fB0xffff_ffff\fP which are equivalent to
\fB1000000\fP and \fB0xffffffff\fP respectively\&.
.PP
It is also possible to specify a base to be used for output in the form
`\fB[#\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP\&', for example `\fB[#16]\fP'\&.  This is used when
outputting arithmetical substitutions or when assigning to scalar
parameters, but an explicitly defined integer or floating point parameter
will not be affected\&.  If an integer variable is implicitly defined by an
arithmetic expression, any base specified in this way will be set as the
variable\&'s output arithmetic base as if the option `\fB\-i\fP \fIbase\fP' to
the \fBtypeset\fP builtin had been used\&.  The expression has no precedence
and if it occurs more than once in a mathematical expression, the last
encountered is used\&.  For clarity it is recommended that it appear at the
beginning of an expression\&.  As an example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset \-i 16 y
print $(( [#8] x = 32, y = 32 ))
print $x $y\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs first `\fB8#40\fP\&', the rightmost value in the given output base, and
then `\fB8#40 16#20\fP\&', because \fBy\fP has been explicitly declared to
have output base 16, while \fBx\fP (assuming it does not already exist) is
implicitly typed by the arithmetic evaluation, where it acquires the output
base 8\&.
.PP
The \fIbase\fP may be replaced or followed by an underscore, which may
itself be followed by a positive integer (if it is missing the value 3
is used)\&.  This indicates that underscores should be inserted into the
output string, grouping the number for visual clarity\&.  The following
integer specifies the number of digits to group together\&.  For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsetopt cbases
print $(( [#16_4] 65536 ** 2 ))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs `\fB0x1_0000_0000\fP\&'\&.
.PP
The feature can be used with floating
point numbers, in which case the base must be omitted; grouping
is away from the decimal point\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzmodload zsh/mathfunc
print $(( [#_] sqrt(1e7) ))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs `\fB3_162\&.277_660_168_379_5\fP\&' (the number of decimal places
shown may vary)\&.
.PP
If the \fBC_BASES\fP option is set, hexadecimal numbers are output in the standard C
format, for example `\fB0xFF\fP\&' instead of the usual `\fB16#FF\fP'\&.  If the
option \fBOCTAL_ZEROES\fP is also set (it is not by default), octal numbers
will be treated similarly and hence appear as `\fB077\fP\&' instead of
`\fB8#77\fP\&'\&.  This option has no effect on the output of bases other than
hexadecimal and octal, and these formats are always understood on input\&.
.PP
When an output base is specified using the `\fB[#\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP\&' syntax,
an appropriate base prefix will be output if necessary, so that the value
output is valid syntax for input\&.  If the \fB#\fP is doubled, for example
`\fB[##16]\fP\&', then no base prefix is output\&.
.PP
Floating point constants are recognized by the presence of a decimal point
or an exponent\&.  The decimal point may be the first character of the
constant, but the exponent character \fBe\fP or \fBE\fP may not, as it will be
taken for a parameter name\&.  All numeric parts (before and after the
decimal point and in the exponent) may contain underscores after the
leading digit for visual guidance; these are ignored in computation\&.

Note the precedence of exponentiation in both cases is below
that of unary operators, hence `\fB\-3**2\fP\&' evaluates as `\fB9\fP', not
`\fB\-9\fP\&'\&.  Use parentheses where necessary: `\fB\-(3**2)\fP'\&.  This is
for compatibility with other shells\&.
.PP
Mathematical functions can be called with the syntax
`\fIfunc\fP\fB(\fP\fIargs\fP\fB)\fP\&', where the function decides
if the \fIargs\fP is used as a string or a comma\-separated list of
arithmetic expressions\&. The shell currently defines no mathematical
functions by default, but the module \fBzsh/mathfunc\fP may be loaded with
the \fBzmodload\fP builtin to provide standard floating point mathematical
functions\&.
.PP
An expression of the form `\fB##\fP\fIx\fP\&' where \fIx\fP is any character
sequence such as `\fBa\fP\&', `\fB^A\fP', or `\fB\eM\-\eC\-x\fP' gives the value of
this character and an expression of the form `\fB#\fP\fIname\fP\&' gives the
value of the first character of the contents of the parameter \fIname\fP\&.
Character values are according to the character set used in the current
locale; for multibyte character handling the option \fBMULTIBYTE\fP must be
set\&.  Note that this form is different from `\fB$#\fP\fIname\fP\&', a standard
parameter substitution which gives the length of the parameter \fIname\fP\&.
`\fB#\e\fP\&' is accepted instead of `\fB##\fP', but its use is deprecated\&.
.PP
Named parameters and subscripted arrays can be referenced by name within an
arithmetic expression without using the parameter expansion syntax\&.  For
example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB((val2 = val1 * 2))\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
assigns twice the value of \fB$val1\fP to the parameter named \fBval2\fP\&.
.PP
An internal integer representation of a named parameter
can be specified with the \fBinteger\fP builtin\&.
Arithmetic evaluation is performed on the value of each
assignment to a named parameter declared integer
in this manner\&.  Assigning a floating point number to an integer results in
rounding towards zero\&.
.PP
Likewise, floating point numbers can be declared with the \fBfloat\fP
builtin; there are two types, differing only in their output format, as
described for the \fBtypeset\fP builtin\&.  The output format can be bypassed
by using arithmetic substitution instead of the parameter substitution,
i\&.e\&. `\fB${\fP\fIfloat\fP\fB}\fP\&' uses the defined format, but
`\fB$((\fP\fIfloat\fP\fB))\fP\&' uses a generic floating point
format\&.
.PP
Promotion of integer to floating point values is performed where
necessary\&.  In addition, if any operator which requires an integer
(`\fB&\fP\&', `\fB|\fP', `\fB^\fP', `\fB<<\fP', `\fB>>\fP' and their equivalents with
assignment) is given a floating point argument, it will be silently rounded
towards zero except for `\fB~\fP\&' which rounds down\&.
.PP
Users should beware that, in common with many other programming
languages but not software designed for calculation, the evaluation of
an expression in zsh is taken a term at a time and promotion of integers
to floating point does not occur in terms only containing integers\&.  A
typical result of this is that a division such as \fB6/8\fP is truncated,
in this being rounded towards 0\&.  The \fBFORCE_FLOAT\fP shell option can
be used in scripts or functions where floating point evaluation is
required throughout\&.
.PP
Scalar variables can hold integer or floating point values at different
times; there is no memory of the numeric type in this case\&.
.PP
If a variable is first assigned in a numeric context without previously
being declared, it will be implicitly typed as \fBinteger\fP or \fBfloat\fP and
retain that type either until the type is explicitly changed or until the
end of the scope\&.  This can have unforeseen consequences\&.  For example, in
the loop
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor (( f = 0; f < 1; f += 0\&.1 )); do
# use $f
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
if \fBf\fP has not already been declared, the first assignment will cause it
to be created as an integer, and consequently the operation `\fBf += 0\&.1\fP\&'
will always cause the result to be truncated to zero, so that the loop will
fail\&.  A simple fix would be to turn the initialization into `\fBf = 0\&.0\fP\&'\&.
It is therefore best to declare numeric variables with explicit types\&.

.PP
For compatibility, if there is a single argument that is not
syntactically significant, typically a variable, the condition is
treated as a test for whether the expression expands as a string of
non\-zero length\&.  In other words, \fB[[ $var ]]\fP is the same as \fB[[ \-n
$var ]]\fP\&.  It is recommended that the second, explicit, form be used
where possible\&.
.PP
Normal shell expansion is performed on the \fIfile\fP, \fIstring\fP and
\fIpattern\fP arguments, but the result of each expansion is constrained to
be a single word, similar to the effect of double quotes\&.
.PP
Filename generation is not performed on any form of argument to
conditions\&.  However, it can be forced in any case where normal shell
expansion is valid and when the option \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP is in effect by
using an explicit glob qualifier of the form \fB(#q)\fP at the
end of the string\&.  A normal glob qualifier expression may appear
between the `\fBq\fP\&' and the closing parenthesis; if none appears the
expression has no effect beyond causing filename generation\&.  The
results of filename generation are joined together to form a single
word, as with the results of other forms of expansion\&.
.PP
This special use of filename generation is only available with the
\fB[[\fP syntax\&.  If the condition occurs within the \fB[\fP or \fBtest\fP
builtin commands then globbing occurs instead as part of normal command
line expansion before the condition is evaluated\&.  In this case it may
generate multiple words which are likely to confuse the syntax of the
test command\&.
.PP
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ \-n file*(#qN) ]]\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
produces status zero if and only if there is at least one file in the
current directory beginning with the string `\fBfile\fP\&'\&.  The globbing
qualifier \fBN\fP ensures that the expression is empty if there is
no matching file\&.
.PP
Pattern metacharacters are active for the \fIpattern\fP arguments;
the patterns are the same as those used for filename generation, see
\fIzshexpn\fP(1), but there is no special behaviour
of `\fB/\fP\&' nor initial dots, and no glob qualifiers are allowed\&.
.PP
In each of the above expressions, if
\fIfile\fP is of the form `\fB/dev/fd/\fP\fIn\fP\&',
where \fIn\fP is an integer,
then the test applied to the open file whose
descriptor number is \fIn\fP,
even if the underlying system does not support
the \fB/dev/fd\fP directory\&.
.PP
In the forms which do numeric comparison, the expressions \fIexp\fP
undergo arithmetic expansion as if they were enclosed in
\fB$((\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB))\fP\&.
.PP
For example, the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB[[ ( \-f foo || \-f bar ) && $report = y* ]] && print File exists\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
tests if either file \fBfoo\fP or file \fBbar\fP exists, and if so, if the
value of the parameter \fBreport\fP begins with `\fBy\fP\&'; if the complete
condition is true, the message `\fBFile exists\&.\fP\&' is printed\&.

Start (stop) using a different foreground colour, if supported
by the terminal\&.  The colour may be specified two ways: either
as a numeric argument, as normal, or by a sequence in braces
following the \fB%F\fP, for example \fB%F{red}\fP\&.  In the latter case
the values allowed are as described for the \fBfg\fP \fBzle_highlight\fP
attribute;
see \fICharacter Highlighting\fP in \fIzshzle\fP(1)\&.  This means that numeric
colours are allowed in the second format also\&.
.TP
\fB%K\fP (\fB%k\fP)
Start (stop) using a different bacKground colour\&.  The syntax is
identical to that for \fB%F\fP and \fB%f\fP\&.

A positive numeric argument between the \fB%\fP and the \fB{\fP is treated as

\fB%G\fP
Within a \fB%{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB%}\fP sequence, include a `glitch\&': that is, assume
that a single character width will be output\&.  This is useful when
outputting characters that otherwise cannot be correctly handled by the
shell, such as the alternate character set on some terminals\&.
The characters in question can be included within a \fB%{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB%}\fP
sequence together with the appropriate number of \fB%G\fP sequences to
indicate the correct width\&.  An integer between the `\fB%\fP\&' and `\fBG\fP'
indicates a character width other than one\&.  Hence \fB%{\fP\fIseq\fP\fB%2G%}\fP
outputs \fIseq\fP and assumes it takes up the width of two standard
characters\&.
.RS
.PP
Multiple uses of \fB%G\fP accumulate in the obvious fashion; the position
of the \fB%G\fP is unimportant\&.  Negative integers are not handled\&.
.PP
Note that when prompt truncation is in use it is advisable to divide up
output into single characters within each \fB%{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB%}\fP group so that
the correct truncation point can be found\&.

\fB%(\fP\fIx\fP\fB\&.\fP\fItrue\-text\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIfalse\-text\fP\fB)\fP
Specifies a ternary expression\&.  The character following the \fIx\fP is
arbitrary; the same character is used to separate the text for the
`true\&' result from that for the `false' result\&.
This separator may not appear in the \fItrue\-text\fP, except as part of a

\fB%[\fP\fIxstring\fP\fB]\fP
Specifies truncation behaviour for the remainder of the prompt string\&.
The third, deprecated, form is equivalent to `\fB%\fP\fIxstringx\fP\&',
i\&.e\&. \fIx\fP may be `\fB<\fP\&' or `\fB>\fP'\&.
The \fIstring\fP will be displayed in
place of the truncated portion of any string; note this does not
undergo prompt expansion\&.
.RS
.PP
The numeric argument, which in the third form may appear immediately
after the `\fB[\fP\&', specifies the maximum permitted length of
the various strings that can be displayed in the prompt\&.
In the first two forms, this numeric argument may be negative, in which
case the truncation length is determined by subtracting the absolute
value of the numeric argument from the number of character positions
remaining on the current prompt line\&.  If this results in a zero or
negative length, a length of 1 is used\&.  In other words, a negative
argument arranges that after truncation at least \fIn\fP characters
remain before the right margin (left margin for \fBRPROMPT\fP)\&.
.PP
The forms with `\fB<\fP\&' truncate at the left of the string,
and the forms with `\fB>\fP\&' truncate at the right of the string\&.
For example, if the current directory is `\fB/home/pike\fP\&',
the prompt `\fB%8<\&.\&.<%/\fP\&' will expand to `\fB\&.\&.e/pike\fP'\&.
In this string, the terminating character (`\fB<\fP\&', `\fB>\fP' or `\fB]\fP'),
or in fact any character, may be quoted by a preceding `\fB\e\fP\&'; note
when using \fBprint \-P\fP, however, that this must be doubled as the
string is also subject to standard \fBprint\fP processing, in addition
to any backslashes removed by a double quoted string:  the worst case
is therefore `\fBprint \-P "%<\e\e\e\e<<\&.\&.\&."\fP\&'\&.
.PP
If the \fIstring\fP is longer than the specified truncation length,
it will appear in full, completely replacing the truncated string\&.
.PP
The part of the prompt string to be truncated runs to the end of the
string, or to the end of the next enclosing group of the `\fB%(\fP\&'
construct, or to the next truncation encountered at the same grouping
level (i\&.e\&. truncations inside a `\fB%(\fP\&' are separate), which
ever comes first\&.  In particular, a truncation with argument zero
(e\&.g\&., `\fB%<<\fP\&') marks the end of the range of the string to be
truncated while turning off truncation from there on\&. For example, the
prompt `\fB%10<\&.\&.\&.<%~%<<%# \fP\&' will print a truncated representation of the
current directory, followed by a `\fB%\fP\&' or `\fB#\fP', followed by a
space\&.  Without the `\fB%<<\fP\&', those two characters would be included
in the string to be truncated\&.  Note that `\fB%\-0<<\fP\&' is not equivalent
to `\fB%<<\fP\&' but specifies that the prompt is truncated at the right margin\&.
.PP
Truncation applies only within each individual line of the prompt, as
delimited by embedded newlines (if any)\&.  If the total length of any line
of the prompt after truncation is greater than the terminal width, or if
the part to be truncated contains embedded newlines, truncation behavior
is undefined and may change in a future version of the shell\&.  Use
`\fB%\-\fP\fIn\fP\fB(l\&.\fP\fItrue\-text\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIfalse\-text\fP\fB)\fP\&' to remove parts
of the prompt when the available space is less than \fIn\fP\&.
