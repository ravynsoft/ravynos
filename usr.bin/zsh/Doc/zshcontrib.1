.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Zsh source distribution includes a number of items contributed by the
user community\&.  These are not inherently a part of the shell, and some
may not be available in every zsh installation\&.  The most significant of
these are documented here\&.  For documentation on other contributed items
such as shell functions, look for comments in the function source files\&.

.SS "Accessing On\-Line Help"
.PP
The key sequence \fBESC h\fP is normally bound by ZLE to execute the
\fBrun\-help\fP widget (see
\fIzshzle\fP(1))\&.  This invokes the \fBrun\-help\fP command with the command word from the
current input line as its argument\&.  By default, \fBrun\-help\fP is an alias
for the \fBman\fP command, so this often fails when the command word is a
shell builtin or a user\-defined function\&.  By redefining the \fBrun\-help\fP
alias, one can improve the on\-line help provided by the shell\&.
.PP
The \fBhelpfiles\fP utility, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is a Perl program that can be used to process the zsh manual
to produce a separate help file for each shell builtin and for many other
shell features as well\&.  The autoloadable \fBrun\-help\fP function, found in
\fBFunctions/Misc\fP, searches for these helpfiles and performs several
other tests to produce the most complete help possible for the command\&.
.PP
Help files are installed by default to a subdirectory of \fB/usr/share/zsh\fP
or \fB/usr/local/share/zsh\fP\&.
.PP
To create your own help files with \fBhelpfiles\fP, choose or create a
directory where the individual command help files will reside\&.  For
example, you might choose \fB~/zsh_help\fP\&.  If you unpacked the zsh
distribution in your home directory, you would use the commands:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBmkdir ~/zsh_help
perl ~/zsh\-5\&.9/Util/helpfiles ~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBHELPDIR\fP parameter tells \fBrun\-help\fP where to look for the help
files\&. When unset, it uses the default installation path\&.
To use your own set of help files, set this to the appropriate path
in one of your startup files:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBHELPDIR=~/zsh_help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
To use the \fBrun\-help\fP function, you need to add lines something
like the following to your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or equivalent startup file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBunalias run\-help
autoload run\-help\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload run\-help\fP\&' to work, the \fBrun\-help\fP
file must be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/run\-help\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Recompiling Functions"
.PP
If you frequently edit your zsh functions, or periodically update your zsh
installation to track the latest developments, you may find that function
digests compiled with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin are frequently out of date
with respect to the function source files\&.  This is not usually a problem,
because zsh always looks for the newest file when loading a function, but
it may cause slower shell startup and function loading\&.  Also, if a digest
file is explicitly used as an element of \fBfpath\fP, zsh won\&'t check whether
any of its source files has changed\&.
.PP
The \fBzrecompile\fP autoloadable function, found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can
be used to keep function digests up to date\&.

This tries to find \fB*\&.zwc\fP files and automatically re\-compile them if at
least one of the original files is newer than the compiled file\&.  This
works only if the names stored in the compiled files are full paths or are
relative to the directory that contains the \fB\&.zwc\fP file\&.
.RS
.PP
In the first form, each \fIname\fP is the name of a compiled file or a
directory containing \fB*\&.zwc\fP files that should be checked\&.  If no
arguments are given, the directories and \fB*\&.zwc\fP files in \fBfpath\fP are
used\&.
.PP
When \fB\-t\fP is given, no compilation is performed, but a return status of
zero (true) is set if there are files that need to be re\-compiled and
non\-zero (false) otherwise\&.  The \fB\-q\fP option quiets the chatty output
that describes what \fBzrecompile\fP is doing\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-t\fP option, the return status is zero if all files that
needed re\-compilation could be compiled and non\-zero if compilation for at
least one of the files failed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-p\fP option is given, the \fIarg\fPs are interpreted as one
or more sets of arguments for \fBzcompile\fP, separated by `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'\&.
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzrecompile \-p \e 
           \-R ~/\&.zshrc \-\- \e 
           \-M ~/\&.zcompdump \-\- \e 
           ~/zsh/comp\&.zwc ~/zsh/Completion/*/_*\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This compiles \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP into \fB~/\&.zshrc\&.zwc\fP if that doesn\&'t exist or
if it is older than \fB~/\&.zshrc\fP\&. The compiled file will be marked for
reading instead of mapping\&. The same is done for \fB~/\&.zcompdump\fP and
\fB~/\&.zcompdump\&.zwc\fP, but this compiled file is marked for mapping\&. The
last line re\-creates the file \fB~/zsh/comp\&.zwc\fP if any of the files
matching the given pattern is newer than it\&.
.PP
Without the \fB\-p\fP option, \fBzrecompile\fP does not create function digests
that do not already exist, nor does it add new functions to the digest\&.
.RE
.PP
The following shell loop is an example of a method for creating function
digests for all functions in your \fBfpath\fP, assuming that you have write
permission to the directories:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfor ((i=1; i <= $#fpath; ++i)); do
  dir=$fpath[i]
  zwc=${dir:t}\&.zwc
  if [[ $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.) || $dir == (\&.|\&.\&.)/* ]]; then
    continue
  fi
  files=($dir/*(N\-\&.))
  if [[ \-w $dir:h && \-n $files ]]; then
    files=(${${(M)files%/*/*}#/})
    if ( cd $dir:h &&
         zrecompile \-p \-U \-z $zwc $files ); then
      fpath[i]=$fpath[i]\&.zwc
    fi
  fi
done\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP options are appropriate for functions in the default
zsh installation \fBfpath\fP; you may need to use different options for your
personal function directories\&.
.PP
Once the digests have been created and your \fBfpath\fP modified to refer to
them, you can keep them up to date by running \fBzrecompile\fP with no
arguments\&.
.PP
.SS "Keyboard Definition"
.PP
The large number of possible combinations of keyboards, workstations,
terminals, emulators, and window systems makes it impossible for zsh to
have built\-in key bindings for every situation\&.  The \fBzkbd\fP utility,
found in \fBFunctions/Misc\fP, can help you quickly create key bindings for your
configuration\&.
.PP
Run \fBzkbd\fP either as an autoloaded function, or as a shell script:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzsh \-f ~/zsh\-5\&.9/Functions/Misc/zkbd\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
When you run \fBzkbd\fP, it first asks you to enter your terminal type; if
the default it offers is correct, just press return\&.  It then asks you to
press a number of different keys to determine characteristics of your
keyboard and terminal; \fBzkbd\fP warns you if it finds anything out of the
ordinary, such as a Delete key that sends neither \fB^H\fP nor \fB^?\fP\&.
.PP
The keystrokes read by \fBzkbd\fP are recorded as a definition for an
associative array named \fBkey\fP, written to a file in the subdirectory
\fB\&.zkbd\fP within either your \fBHOME\fP or \fBZDOTDIR\fP directory\&.  The name
of the file is composed from the \fBTERM\fP, \fBVENDOR\fP and \fBOSTYPE\fP
parameters, joined by hyphens\&.
.PP
You may read this file into your \fB\&.zshrc\fP or another startup file with
the `\fBsource\fP\&' or `\fB\&.\fP' commands, then reference the \fBkey\fP parameter
in bindkey commands, like this:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBsource ${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.zkbd/$TERM\-$VENDOR\-$OSTYPE
[[ \-n ${key[Left]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Left]}" backward\-char
[[ \-n ${key[Right]} ]] && bindkey "${key[Right]}" forward\-char
# etc\&.\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that in order for `\fBautoload zkbd\fP\&' to work, the \fBzkdb\fP file must
be in one of the directories named in your \fBfpath\fP array (see
\fIzshparam\fP(1))\&.  This should already be the case if you have a standard zsh
installation; if it is not, copy \fBFunctions/Misc/zkbd\fP to an
appropriate directory\&.
.PP
.SS "Dumping Shell State"
.PP
Occasionally you may encounter what appears to be a bug in the shell,
particularly if you are using a beta version of zsh or a development
release\&.  Usually it is sufficient to send a description of the
problem to one of the zsh mailing lists (see
\fIzsh\fP(1)), but sometimes one of the zsh developers will need to recreate your
environment in order to track the problem down\&.
.PP
The script named \fBreporter\fP, found in the \fBUtil\fP directory of the
distribution, is provided for this purpose\&.  (It is also possible to
\fBautoload reporter\fP, but \fBreporter\fP is not installed in \fBfpath\fP
by default\&.)  This script outputs a detailed dump of the shell state,
in the form of another script that can be read with `\fBzsh \-f\fP\&' to
recreate that state\&.
.PP
To use \fBreporter\fP, read the script into your shell with the `\fB\&.\fP\&'
command and redirect the output into a file:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\&. ~/zsh\-5\&.9/Util/reporter > zsh\&.report\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
You should check the \fBzsh\&.report\fP file for any sensitive information
such as passwords and delete them by hand before sending the script to the
developers\&.  Also, as the output can be voluminous, it\&'s best to wait for
the developers to ask for this information before sending it\&.
.PP
You can also use \fBreporter\fP to dump only a subset of the shell state\&.
This is sometimes useful for creating startup files for the first time\&.
Most of the output from reporter is far more detailed than usually is
necessary for a startup file, but the \fBaliases\fP, \fBoptions\fP, and
\fBzstyles\fP states may be useful because they include only changes from
the defaults\&.  The \fBbindings\fP state may be useful if you have created
any of your own keymaps, because \fBreporter\fP arranges to dump the keymap
creation commands as well as the bindings for every keymap\&.
.PP
As is usual with automated tools, if you create a startup file with
\fBreporter\fP, you should edit the results to remove unnecessary commands\&.
Note that if you\&'re using the new completion system, you should \fInot\fP
dump the \fBfunctions\fP state to your startup files with \fBreporter\fP; use
the \fBcompdump\fP function instead (see
\fIzshcompsys\fP(1))\&.

\fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP [ \fB\-L\fP | \fB\-dD\fP ] [ \fB\-Uzk\fP ] \fIhook\fP \fIfunction\fP
Several functions are special to the shell, as described in the section
SPECIAL FUNCTIONS, see \fIzshmisc\fP(1),
in that they are automatically called at specific points during shell execution\&.
Each has an associated array consisting of names of functions to be
called at the same point; these are so\-called `hook functions\&'\&.
The shell function \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP provides a simple way of adding or
removing functions from the array\&.
.RS
.PP
\fIhook\fP is one of \fBchpwd\fP, \fBperiodic\fP, \fBprecmd\fP, \fBpreexec\fP,
\fBzshaddhistory\fP, \fBzshexit\fP, or \fBzsh_directory_name\fP,
the special functions in question\&.  Note that \fBzsh_directory_name\fP
is called in a different way from the other functions, but may
still be manipulated as a hook\&.
.PP
\fIfunction\fP is name of an ordinary shell function\&.  If no options
are given this will be added to the array of functions to be executed
in the given context\&.
Functions are invoked in the order they were added\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-L\fP is given, the current values for the hook arrays
are listed with \fBtypeset\fP\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-d\fP is given, the \fIfunction\fP is removed from
the array of functions to be executed\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-D\fP is given, the \fIfunction\fP is treated as a pattern
and any matching names of functions are removed from the array of
functions to be executed\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-U\fP, \fB\-z\fP and \fB\-k\fP are passed as arguments to
\fBautoload\fP for \fIfunction\fP\&.  For functions contributed with zsh, the
options \fB\-Uz\fP are appropriate\&.

\fBadd\-zle\-hook\-widget\fP [ \fB\-L\fP | \fB\-dD\fP ] [ \fB\-Uzk\fP ] \fIhook\fP \fIwidgetname\fP
Several widget names are special to the line editor, as described in the section
Special Widgets, see \fIzshzle\fP(1),
in that they are automatically called at specific points during editing\&.
Unlike function hooks, these do not use a predefined array of other names
to call at the same point; the shell function \fBadd\-zle\-hook\-widget\fP
maintains a similar array and arranges for the special widget to invoke
those additional widgets\&.
.RS
.PP
\fIhook\fP is one of \fBisearch\-exit\fP, \fBisearch\-update\fP,
\fBline\-pre\-redraw\fP, \fBline\-init\fP, \fBline\-finish\fP, \fBhistory\-line\-set\fP,
or \fBkeymap\-select\fP, corresponding to each of the special widgets
\fBzle\-isearch\-exit\fP, etc\&.  The special widget names are also accepted
as the \fIhook\fP argument\&.
.PP
\fIwidgetname\fP is the name of a ZLE widget\&.  If no options are given this
is added to the array of widgets to be invoked in the given hook context\&.
Widgets are invoked in the order they were added, with
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBzle \fP\fIwidgetname\fP\fB \-Nw \-f "nolast" \-\- "$@"\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that this means that the `\fBWIDGET\fP\&' special parameter tracks the
\fIwidgetname\fP when the widget function is called, rather than tracking
the name of the corresponding special hook widget\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-d\fP is given, the \fIwidgetname\fP is removed from
the array of widgets to be executed\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-D\fP is given, the \fIwidgetname\fP is treated as a pattern
and any matching names of widgets are removed from the array\&.
.PP
If \fIwidgetname\fP does not name an existing widget when added to the
array, it is assumed that a shell function also named \fIwidgetname\fP is
meant to provide the implementation of the widget\&.  This name is therefore
marked for autoloading, and the options \fB\-U\fP, \fB\-z\fP and \fB\-k\fP are
passed as arguments to \fBautoload\fP as with \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP\&.  The
widget is also created with `\fBzle \-N \fP\fIwidgetname\fP\&' to cause the
corresponding function to be loaded the first time the hook is called\&.
.PP
The arrays of \fIwidgetname\fP are currently maintained in \fBzstyle\fP
contexts, one for each \fIhook\fP context, with a style of `\fBwidgets\fP\&'\&.
If the \fB\-L\fP option is given, this set of styles is listed with
`\fBzstyle \-L\fP\&'\&.  This implementation may change, and the special widgets
that refer to the styles are created only if \fBadd\-zle\-hook\-widget\fP is
called to add at least one widget, so if this function is used for any
hooks, then all hooks should be managed only via this function\&.
.RE
.PP
.SH "REMEMBERING RECENT DIRECTORIES"
.PP
The function \fBcdr\fP allows you to change the working directory to a
previous working directory from a list maintained automatically\&.  It is
similar in concept to the directory stack controlled by the \fBpushd\fP,
\fBpopd\fP and \fBdirs\fP builtins, but is more configurable, and as it stores
all entries in files it is maintained across sessions and (by default)
between terminal emulators in the current session\&.  Duplicates are
automatically removed, so that the list reflects the single most recent
use of each directory\&.
.PP
Note that the \fBpushd\fP directory stack is not actually modified or used
by \fBcdr\fP unless you configure it to do so as described in the
configuration section below\&.
.PP
.SS "Installation"
.PP
The system works by means of a hook function that is called every time the
directory changes\&.  To install the system, autoload the required functions
and use the \fBadd\-zsh\-hook\fP function described above:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-Uz chpwd_recent_dirs cdr add\-zsh\-hook
add\-zsh\-hook chpwd chpwd_recent_dirs\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Now every time you change directly interactively, no matter which
command you use, the directory to which you change will be remembered
in most\-recent\-first order\&.
.PP
.SS "Use"
.PP
All direct user interaction is via the \fBcdr\fP function\&.
.PP
The argument to cdr is a number \fIN\fP corresponding to the \fIN\fPth most
recently changed\-to directory\&.  1 is the immediately preceding directory;
the current directory is remembered but is not offered as a destination\&.
Note that if you have multiple windows open 1 may refer to a directory
changed to in another window; you can avoid this by having per\-terminal
files for storing directory as described for the
\fBrecent\-dirs\-file\fP style below\&.
.PP
If you set the \fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP style described below \fBcdr\fP
will behave the same as \fBcd\fP if given a non\-numeric argument, or more
than one argument\&.  The recent directory list is updated just the same
however you change directory\&.
.PP
If the argument is omitted, 1 is assumed\&.  This is similar to \fBpushd\fP\&'s
behaviour of swapping the two most recent directories on the stack\&.
.PP
Completion for the argument to \fBcdr\fP is available if compinit has been
run; menu selection is recommended, using:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':completion:*:*:cdr:*:*' menu selection\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
to allow you to cycle through recent directories; the order is preserved,
so the first choice is the most recent directory before the current one\&.
The verbose style is also recommended to ensure the directory is shown; this
style is on by default so no action is required unless you have changed it\&.

.TP
\fB\-p \&'\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB'\fP
Prunes any items in the directory list that match the given extended glob

file name in the list; the full string must match, so wildcards at the
end (e\&.g\&. \fB\&'*removeme*'\fP) are needed to remove entries with a given
substring\&.
.RS
.PP
If output is to a terminal, then the function will print the new list
after pruning and prompt for confirmation by the user\&.  This output and
confirmation step can be skipped by using \fB\-P\fP instead of \fB\-p\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
.SS "Configuration"
.PP
Configuration is by means of the styles mechanism that should be familiar
from completion; if not, see the description of the \fBzstyle\fP command in
see \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  The context for setting styles
should be \fB\&':chpwd:*'\fP in case the meaning of the context is extended in
future, for example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':chpwd:*' recent\-dirs\-max 0\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
sets the value of the \fBrecent\-dirs\-max\fP style to 0\&.  In practice the
style name is specific enough that a context of \&'*' should be fine\&.
.PP
An exception is \fBrecent\-dirs\-insert\fP, which is used exclusively by the
completion system and so has the usual completion system context
(\fB\&':completion:*'\fP if nothing more specific is needed), though again
\fB\&'*'\fP should be fine in practice\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP
If true, and the command is expecting a recent directory index, and
either there is more than one argument or the argument is not an
integer, then fall through to "cd"\&.  This allows the lazy to use only
one command for directory changing\&.  Completion recognises this, too;
see recent\-dirs\-insert for how to control completion when this option
is in use\&.
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-file\fP
The file where the list of directories is saved\&.  The default
is \fB${ZDOTDIR:\-$HOME}/\&.chpwd\-recent\-dirs\fP, i\&.e\&. this is in your
home directory unless you have set the variable \fBZDOTDIR\fP to point
somewhere else\&.  Directory names are saved in \fB$\&'\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB'\fP quoted
form, so each line in the file can be supplied directly to the shell as an
argument\&.
.RS
.PP
The value of this style may be an array\&.  In this case, the first
file in the list will always be used for saving directories while any
other files are left untouched\&.  When reading the recent directory
list, if there are fewer than the maximum number of entries in the
first file, the contents of later files in the array will be appended
with duplicates removed from the list shown\&.  The contents of the two
files are not sorted together, i\&.e\&. all the entries in the first file
are shown first\&.  The special value \fB+\fP can appear in the list to
indicate the default file should be read at that point\&.  This allows
effects like the following:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':chpwd:*' recent\-dirs\-file \e 
~/\&.chpwd\-recent\-dirs\-${TTY##*/} +\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Recent directories are read from a file numbered according to
the terminal\&.  If there are insufficient entries the list
is supplemented from the default file\&.
.PP
It is possible to use \fBzstyle \-e\fP to make the directory configurable
at run time:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \-e \&':chpwd:*' recent\-dirs\-file pick\-recent\-dirs\-file
pick\-recent\-dirs\-file() {

directory under it, then use a special file for saving recent
directories, else use the default\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-insert\fP
Used by completion\&.  If \fBrecent\-dirs\-default\fP is true, then setting
this to \fBtrue\fP causes the actual directory, rather than its index, to
be inserted on the command line; this has the same effect as using
the corresponding index, but makes the history clearer and the line
easier to edit\&.  With this setting, if part of an argument was
already typed, normal directory completion rather than recent
directory completion is done; this is because recent directory
completion is expected to be done by cycling through entries menu
fashion\&.
.RS
.PP
If the value of the style is \fBalways\fP, then only recent directories will
be completed; in that case, use the \fBcd\fP command when you want to
complete other directories\&.
.PP
If the value is \fBfallback\fP, recent directories will be tried first, then
normal directory completion is performed if recent directory completion
failed to find a match\&.
.PP
Finally, if the value is \fBboth\fP then both sets of completions are
presented; the usual tag mechanism can be used to distinguish results, with
recent directories tagged as \fBrecent\-dirs\fP\&.  Note that the recent
directories inserted are abbreviated with directory names where appropriate\&.

The maximum number of directories to save to the file\&.  If
this is zero or negative there is no maximum\&.  The default is 20\&.
Note this includes the current directory, which isn\&'t offered,
so the highest number of directories you will be offered
is one less than the maximum\&.
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-prune\fP
This style is an array determining what directories should (or should
not) be added to the recent list\&.  Elements of the array can include:
.RS
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBparent\fP
Prune parents (more accurately, ancestors) from the recent list\&.
If present, changing directly down by any number of directories
causes the current directory to be overwritten\&.  For example,
changing from ~pws to ~pws/some/other/dir causes ~pws not to be
left on the recent directory stack\&.  This only applies to direct
changes to descendant directories; earlier directories on the
list are not pruned\&.  For example, changing from ~pws/yet/another
to ~pws/some/other/dir does not cause ~pws to be pruned\&.
.TP
\fBpattern:\fP\fIpattern\fP
Gives a zsh pattern for directories that should not be
added to the recent list (if not already there)\&.  This element
can be repeated to add different patterns\&.  For example,
\fB\&'pattern:/tmp(|/*)'\fP stops \fB/tmp\fP or its descendants
from being added\&.  The \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option is always turned on
for these patterns\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBrecent\-dirs\-pushd\fP
If set to true, \fBcdr\fP will use \fBpushd\fP instead of \fBcd\fP to change the
directory, so the directory is saved on the directory stack\&.  As the
directory stack is completely separate from the list of files saved
by the mechanism used in this file there is no obvious reason to do
this\&.

.RE

.PP
.SS "Details of directory handling"
.PP
This section is for the curious or confused; most users will not
need to know this information\&.
.PP
Recent directories are saved to a file immediately and hence are
preserved across sessions\&.  Note currently no file locking is applied:
the list is updated immediately on interactive commands and nowhere else
(unlike history), and it is assumed you are only going to change
directory in one window at once\&.  This is not safe on shared accounts,
but in any case the system has limited utility when someone else is
changing to a different set of directories behind your back\&.
.PP
To make this a little safer, only directory changes instituted from the
command line, either directly or indirectly through shell function calls
(but not through subshells, evals, traps, completion functions and the
like) are saved\&.  Shell functions should use \fBcd \-q\fP or \fBpushd \-q\fP to
avoid side effects if the change to the directory is to be invisible at the
command line\&.  See the contents of the function \fBchpwd_recent_dirs\fP for
more details\&.
.PP
.SH "ABBREVIATED DYNAMIC REFERENCES TO DIRECTORIES"
.PP
The dynamic directory naming system is described in the subsection
\fIDynamic named directories\fP of
the section \fIFilename Expansion\fP in \fIzshexpn\fP(1)\&.  In this, a reference to
\fB~[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP is expanded by a function found by the hooks
mechanism\&.
.PP
The contributed function \fBzsh_directory_name_generic\fP provides a
system allowing the user to refer to directories with only a limited
amount of new code\&.  It supports all three of the standard interfaces
for directory naming: converting from a name to a directory, converting
in the reverse direction to find a short name, and completion of names\&.
.PP
The main feature of this function is a path\-like syntax,
combining abbreviations at multiple levels separated by ":"\&.
As an example, ~[g:p:s] might specify:
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBg\fP
The top level directory for your git area\&.  This first component
has to match, or the function will return indicating another
directory name hook function should be tried\&.
.TP
\fBp\fP
The name of a project within your git area\&.
.TP
\fBs\fP
The source area within that project\&.
This allows you to collapse references to long hierarchies to a very
compact form, particularly if the hierarchies are similar across different
areas of the disk\&.
.PP
Name components may be completed: if a description is shown at the top
of the list of completions, it includes the path to which previous
components expand, while the description for an individual completion
shows the path segment it would add\&.  No additional configuration is
needed for this as the completion system is aware of the dynamic
directory name mechanism\&.
.PP
.SS "Usage"
.PP
To use the function, first define a wrapper function for your specific
case\&.  We\&'ll assume it's to be autoloaded\&.  This can have any name but
we\&'ll refer to it as zdn_mywrapper\&.  This wrapper function will define
various variables and then call this function with the same arguments
that the wrapper function gets\&.  This configuration is described below\&.
.PP
Then arrange for the wrapper to be run as a zsh_directory_name hook:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBautoload \-Uz add\-zsh\-hook zsh_directory_name_generic zdn_mywrapper
add\-zsh\-hook \-U zsh_directory_name zdn_mywrapper\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
.SS "Configuration"
.PP
The wrapper function should define a local associative array zdn_top\&.
Alternatively, this can be set with a style called \fBmapping\fP\&.  The
context for the style is \fB:zdn:\fP\fIwrapper\-name\fP where
\fIwrapper\-name\fP is the function calling zsh_directory_name_generic;
for example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle :zdn:zdn_mywrapper: mapping zdn_mywrapper_top\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The keys in this associative array correspond to the first component of
the name\&.  The values are matching directories\&.  They may have an
optional suffix with a slash followed by a colon and the name of a
variable in the same format to give the next component\&.  (The slash
before the colon is to disambiguate the case where a colon is needed in
the path for a drive\&.  There is otherwise no syntax for escaping this,
so path components whose names start with a colon are not supported\&.)  A
special component \fB:default:\fP specifies a variable in the form
\fB/:\fP\fIvar\fP (the path section is ignored and so is usually empty)
that will be used for the next component if no variable is given for the
path\&.  Variables referred to within \fBzdn_top\fP have the same format as
\fBzdn_top\fP itself, but contain relative paths\&.
.PP
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBlocal \-A zdn_top=(
  g   ~/git
  ga  ~/alternate/git
  gs  /scratch/$USER/git/:second2
  :default: /:second1
)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This specifies the behaviour of a directory referred to as \fB~[g:\&.\&.\&.]\fP
or \fB~[ga:\&.\&.\&.]\fP or \fB~[gs:\&.\&.\&.]\fP\&.  Later path components are optional;
in that case \fB~[g]\fP expands to \fB~/git\fP, and so on\&.  \fBgs\fP expands
to \fB/scratch/$USER/git\fP and uses the associative array \fBsecond2\fP to
match the second component; \fBg\fP and \fBga\fP use the associative array
\fBsecond1\fP to match the second component\&.
.PP
When expanding a name to a directory, if the first component is not \fBg\fP or
\fBga\fP or \fBgs\fP, it is not an error; the function simply returns 1 so that a
later hook function can be tried\&.  However, matching the first component
commits the function, so if a later component does not match, an error
is printed (though this still does not stop later hooks from being
executed)\&.
.PP
For components after the first, a relative path is expected, but note that
multiple levels may still appear\&.  Here is an example of \fBsecond1\fP:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBlocal \-A second1=(
  p   myproject
  s   somproject
  os  otherproject/subproject/:third
)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The path as found from \fBzdn_top\fP is extended with the matching
directory, so \fB~[g:p]\fP becomes \fB~/git/myproject\fP\&.  The slash between
is added automatically (it\&'s not possible to have a later component
modify the name of a directory already matched)\&.  Only \fBos\fP specifies
a variable for a third component, and there\&'s no \fB:default:\fP, so it's
an error to use a name like \fB~[g:p:x]\fP or \fB~[ga:s:y]\fP because
there\&'s nowhere to look up the \fBx\fP or \fBy\fP\&.
.PP
The associative arrays need to be visible within this function; the
generic function therefore uses internal variable names beginning
\fB_zdn_\fP in order to avoid clashes\&.  Note that the variable \fBreply\fP
needs to be passed back to the shell, so should not be local in the
calling function\&.
.PP
The function does not test whether directories assembled by component
actually exist; this allows the system to work across automounted
file systems\&.  The error from the command trying to use a non\-existent
directory should be sufficient to indicate the problem\&.
.PP
.SS "Complete example"
.PP
Here is a full fictitious but usable autoloadable definition of the
example function defined by the code above\&.  So \fB~[gs:p:s]\fP expands
to \fB/scratch/$USER/git/myscratchproject/top/srcdir\fP (with \fB$USER\fP
also expanded)\&.
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBlocal \-A zdn_top=(
  g   ~/git
  ga  ~/alternate/git
  gs  /scratch/$USER/git/:second2
  :default: /:second1

slower but might be more accurate in all possible cases\&. This style is
used by the \fBbzr\fP, \fBhg\fP, and \fBgit\fP backends\&. In the case of \fBhg\fP it will invoke
the external hexdump program to parse the binary dirstate cache file; this

If you want to use the \fB%b\fP (bold off) prompt expansion in \fBformats\fP,
which expands \fB%b\fP itself, use \fB%%b\fP\&. That will cause the \fBvcs_info\fP
expansion to replace \fB%%b\fP with \fB%b\fP, so that zsh\&'s prompt expansion
mechanism can handle it\&. Similarly, to hand down \fB%b\fP from
\fBbranchformat\fP, use \fB%%%%b\fP\&. Sorry for this inconvenience, but it
cannot be easily avoided\&. Luckily we do not clash with a lot of prompt
expansions and this only needs to be done for those\&.
.PP
When one of the \fBgen\-applied\-string\fP, \fBgen\-unapplied\-string\fP, and
\fBset\-patch\-format\fP hooks is defined,
applying \fB%\fP\-escaping (`\fBfoo=${foo//\&'%'/%%}\fP') to the interpolated values
for use in the prompt is the responsibility of those hooks (jointly);
when neither of those hooks is defined, \fBvcs_info\fP handles escaping by itself\&.
We regret this coupling, but it was required for backwards compatibility\&.
.PP
.SS "Quilt Support"
.PP
\fBQuilt\fP is not a version control system, therefore this is not implemented
as a backend\&. It can help keeping track of a series of patches\&. People use it
to keep a set of changes they want to use on top of software packages (which
is tightly integrated into the package build process \- the Debian project
does this for a large number of packages)\&. Quilt can also help individual
developers keep track of their own patches on top of real version control
systems\&.
.PP
The \fBvcs_info\fP integration tries to support both ways of using quilt by
having two slightly different modes of operation: `addon\&' mode and
`standalone\&' mode)\&.
.PP
Quilt integration is off by default; to enable it, set the \fBuse\-quilt\fP style,
and add \fB%Q\fP to your \fBformats\fP or \fBactionformats\fP style:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*' use\-quilt true\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Styles looked up from the Quilt support code include `\fB\&.quilt\-\fP\fIquilt\-mode\fP\&'
in the \fIvcs\-string\fP part of the context, where \fIquilt\-mode\fP is either
\fBaddon\fP or \fBstandalone\fP\&.
Example: \fB:vcs_info:git\&.quilt\-addon:default:\fP\fIrepo\-root\-name\fP\&.
.PP
For `addon\&' mode to become active \fBvcs_info\fP must have already detected a
real version control system controlling the directory\&. If that is the case,
a directory that holds quilt\&'s patches needs to be found\&. That directory is
configurable via the `\fBQUILT_PATCHES\fP\&' environment variable\&. If that
variable exists its value is used, otherwise the value `\fBpatches\fP\&' is
assumed\&. The value from \fB$QUILT_PATCHES\fP can be overwritten using the
`\fBquilt\-patch\-dir\fP\&' style\&. (Note: you can use \fBvcs_info\fP to keep the value
of \fB$QUILT_PATCHES\fP correct all the time via the \fBpost\-quilt\fP hook)\&.
.PP
When the directory in question is found, quilt is assumed to be active\&. To
gather more information, \fBvcs_info\fP looks for a directory called `\&.pc\&';
Quilt uses that directory to track its current state\&. If this directory does
not exist we know that quilt has not done anything to the working directory
(read: no patches have been applied yet)\&.
.PP
If patches are applied, \fBvcs_info\fP will try to find out which\&. If you want
to know which patches of a series are not yet applied, you need to activate
the \fBget\-unapplied\fP style in the appropriate context\&.
.PP
\fBvcs_info\fP allows for very detailed control over how the gathered
information is presented (see 
the \fBConfiguration\fP and \fBHooks in vcs_info\fP sections),
all of which are documented below\&. Note there are a number of
other patch tracking systems that work on top of a certain version control
system (like \fBstgit\fP for \fBgit\fP, or \fBmq\fP for \fBhg\fP); the configuration
for systems like that are generally configured the same way as the \fBquilt\fP
support\&.
.PP
If the \fBquilt\fP support is working in `addon\&' mode, the produced string is
available as a simple format replacement (\fB%Q\fP to be precise), which can
be used in \fBformats\fP and \fBactionformats\fP; see below for details)\&.
.PP
If, on the other hand, the support code is working in `standalone\&' mode,
\fBvcs_info\fP will pretend as if \fBquilt\fP were an actual version control
system\&. That means that the version control system identifier (which
otherwise would be something like `svn\&' or `cvs') will be set to
`\fB\-quilt\-\fP\&'\&. This has implications on the used style context where this
identifier is the second element\&. \fBvcs_info\fP will have filled in a proper
value for the "repository\&'s" root directory and the string containing the
information about quilt\&'s state will be available as the `misc' replacement
(and \fB%Q\fP for compatibility with `addon\&' mode)\&.
.PP
What is left to discuss is how `standalone\&' mode is detected\&. The detection
itself is a series of searches for directories\&. You can have this detection
enabled all the time in every directory that is not otherwise under version
control\&. If you know there is only a limited set of trees where you would
like \fBvcs_info\fP to try and look for Quilt in `standalone\&' mode to minimise
the amount of searching on every call to \fBvcs_info\fP, there are a number of
ways to do that:
.PP
Essentially, `standalone\&' mode detection is controlled by a style called
`\fBquilt\-standalone\fP\&'\&. It is a string style and its value can have different
effects\&. The simplest values are: `\fBalways\fP\&' to run detection every time
\fBvcs_info\fP is run, and `\fBnever\fP\&' to turn the detection off entirely\&.
.PP
If the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is something else, it is interpreted
differently\&. If the value is the name of a scalar variable the value of that
variable is checked and that value is used in the same `always\&'/`never' way
as described above\&.
.PP
If the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is an array, the elements of that array
are used as directory names under which you want the detection to be active\&.
.PP
If \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is an associative array, the keys are taken as
directory names under which you want the detection to be active, but only if
the corresponding value is the string `\fBtrue\fP\&'\&.
.PP
Last, but not least, if the value of \fBquilt\-standalone\fP is the name of a
function, the function is called without arguments and the return value
decides whether detection should be active\&. A `0\&' return value is true; a
non\-zero return value is interpreted as false\&.
.PP
Note, if there is both a function and a variable by the name of
\fBquilt\-standalone\fP, the function will take precedence\&.

.SS "Hooks in vcs_info"
.PP
Hooks are places in \fBvcs_info\fP where you can run your own code\&. That

change the system\&'s behaviour\&.
.PP
For configuration, hooks change the style context:
.RS

.fi
.RE
.PP
To register functions to a hook, you need to list them in the \fBhooks\fP
style in the appropriate context\&.
.PP
Example:
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':vcs_info:*+foo:*' hooks bar baz\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This registers functions to the hook `foo\&' for all backends\&. In order to
avoid namespace problems, all registered function names are prepended by
a `\fB+vi\-\fP\&', so the actual functions called for the `foo' hook are
`\fB+vi\-bar\fP\&' and `\fB+vi\-baz\fP'\&.
.PP
If you would like to register a function to a hook regardless of the
current context, you may use the \fBvcs_info_hookadd\fP function\&. To remove
a function that was added like that, the \fBvcs_info_hookdel\fP function
can be used\&.
.PP
If something seems weird, you can enable the `debug\&' boolean style in
the proper context and the hook\-calling code will print what it tried
to execute and whether the function in question existed\&.
.PP
When you register more than one function to a hook, all functions are
executed one after another until one function returns non\-zero or until
all functions have been called\&. Context\-sensitive hook functions are
executed \fBbefore\fP statically registered ones (the ones added by
\fBvcs_info_hookadd\fP)\&.

First, we will tell \fBvcs_info\fP to call a function when populating

That should give you an idea what is going on\&. Specifically, the function

Simple enough\&. And it could have even been simpler, if only we had

Again, we start off by registering a function:

And then we define the `\fB+vi\-hgbookmarks\fP\&' function:

    # The bookmarks returned by `hg\&' are available in

    local s="${(Mj:,:)@:#sh/*}"

The first eight `\fB\-match\fP\&' functions are drop\-in replacements for the

way\&.  However, by the use of styles and the function \fBselect\-word\-style\fP,
the way words are matched can be altered\&. \fBselect\-word\-match\fP is intended
to be used as a text object in vi mode but with custom word styles\&. For
comparison, the widgets described in \fIzshzle\fP(1) under Text Objects use fixed definitions of words, compatible
with the \fBvim\fP editor\&.
.RS
.PP
The simplest way of configuring the functions is to use
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP, which can either be called as a normal function with
the appropriate argument, or invoked as a user\-defined widget that will
prompt for the first character of the word style to be used\&.  The first
time it is invoked, the first eight \fB\-match\fP functions will automatically
replace the builtin versions, so they do not need to be loaded explicitly\&.

is examined\&.

Restore the default settings; this is usually the same as `\fBnormal\fP\&'\&.
.PP
All but `\fBdefault\fP\&' can be input as an upper case character, which has
the same effect but with subword matching turned on\&.  In this case, words
with upper case characters are treated specially: each separate run of
upper case characters, or an upper case character followed by any number of
other characters, is considered a word\&.  The style \fBsubword\-range\fP
can supply an alternative character range to the default `\fB[:upper:]\fP\&';
the value of the style is treated as the contents of a `\fB[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&'
pattern (note that the outer brackets should not be supplied, only
those surrounding named ranges)\&.
.PP
More control can be obtained using the \fBzstyle\fP command, as described in
\fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  Each style is looked up in the
context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP where \fIwidget\fP is the name of the
user\-defined widget, not the name of the function implementing it, so in
the case of the definitions supplied by \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the
appropriate contexts are \fB:zle:forward\-word\fP, and so on\&.  The function
\fBselect\-word\-style\fP itself always defines styles for the context
`\fB:zle:*\fP\&' which can be overridden by more specific (longer) patterns as
well as explicit contexts\&.
.PP
The style \fBword\-style\fP specifies the rules to use\&.  This may have the
following values\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBnormal\fP
Use the standard shell rules, i\&.e\&. alphanumerics and \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, unless
overridden by the styles \fBword\-chars\fP or \fBword\-class\fP\&.
.TP
\fBspecified\fP
Similar to \fBnormal\fP, but \fIonly\fP the specified characters, and not also
alphanumerics, are considered word characters\&.
.TP
\fBunspecified\fP
The negation of specified\&.  The given characters are those which will
\fInot\fP be considered part of a word\&.
.TP
\fBshell\fP
Words are obtained by using the syntactic rules for generating shell
command arguments\&.  In addition, special tokens which are never command
arguments such as `\fB()\fP\&' are also treated as words\&.
.TP
\fBwhitespace\fP
Words are whitespace\-delimited strings of characters\&.
.PP
The first three of those rules usually use \fB$WORDCHARS\fP, but the value
in the parameter can be overridden by the style \fBword\-chars\fP, which works
in exactly the same way as \fB$WORDCHARS\fP\&.  In addition, the style
\fBword\-class\fP uses character class syntax to group characters and takes
precedence over \fBword\-chars\fP if both are set\&.  The \fBword\-class\fP style
does not include the surrounding brackets of the character class; for
example, `\fB\-:[:alnum:]\fP\&' is a valid \fBword\-class\fP to include all
alphanumerics plus the characters `\fB\-\fP\&' and `\fB:\fP'\&.  Be careful
including `\fB]\fP\&', `\fB^\fP' and `\fB\-\fP' as these are special inside
character classes\&.
.PP
\fBword\-style\fP may also have `\fB\-subword\fP\&' appended to its value to
turn on subword matching, as described above\&.
.PP
The style \fBskip\-chars\fP is mostly useful for
\fBtranspose\-words\fP and similar functions\&.  If set, it gives a count of
characters starting at the cursor position which will not be considered
part of the word and are treated as space, regardless of what they actually
are\&.  For example, if
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':zle:transpose\-words' skip\-chars 1\fP

.RE
.PP
has been set, and \fBtranspose\-words\-match\fP is called with the cursor on
the \fIX\fP of \fBfoo\fP\fIX\fP\fBbar\fP, where \fIX\fP can be any character, then
the resulting expression is \fBbar\fP\fIX\fP\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
Finer grained control can be obtained by setting the style \fBword\-context\fP
to an array of pairs of entries\&.  Each pair of entries consists of a
\fIpattern\fP and a \fIsubcontext\fP\&.  The shell argument the cursor is on is
matched against each \fIpattern\fP in turn until one matches; if it does,
the context is extended by a colon and the corresponding \fIsubcontext\fP\&.
Note that the test is made against the original word on the line, with no
stripping of quotes\&.  Special handling is done between words: the current
context is examined and if it contains the string \fBbetween\fP the word
is set to a single space; else if it is contains the string \fBback\fP,
the word before the cursor is considered, else the word after cursor is
considered\&. Some examples are given below\&.

The style \fBskip\-whitespace\-first\fP is only used with the
\fBforward\-word\fP widget\&.  If it is set to true, then \fBforward\-word\fP
skips any non\-word\-characters, followed by any non\-word\-characters:
this is similar to the behaviour of other word\-orientated widgets,
and also that used by other editors, however it differs from the
standard zsh behaviour\&.  When using \fBselect\-word\-style\fP the widget
is set in the context \fB:zle:*\fP to \fBtrue\fP if the word style is
\fBbash\fP and \fBfalse\fP otherwise\&.  It may be overridden by setting it in
the more specific context \fB:zle:forward\-word*\fP\&.
.PP
It is possible to create widgets with specific behaviour by defining
a new widget implemented by the appropriate generic function, then
setting a style for the context of the specific widget\&.  For example,
the following defines a widget \fBbackward\-kill\-space\-word\fP using
\fBbackward\-kill\-word\-match\fP, the generic widget implementing
\fBbackward\-kill\-word\fP behaviour, and ensures that the new widget
always implements space\-delimited behaviour\&.

This provides two different ways of using \fBtranspose\-words\fP depending on
whether the cursor is on whitespace between words or on a filename, here
any word containing a \fB/\fP\&.  On whitespace, complete arguments as defined
by standard shell rules will be transposed\&.  In a filename, only
alphanumerics will be transposed\&.  Elsewhere, words will be transposed
using the default style for \fB:zle:transpose\-words\fP\&.
.PP
The word matching and all the handling of \fBzstyle\fP settings is actually
implemented by the function \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP\&.  This can be used to
create new user\-defined widgets\&.  The calling function should set the local
parameter \fBcurcontext\fP to \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP, create the local
parameter \fBmatched_words\fP and call \fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP with no
arguments\&.  On return, \fBmatched_words\fP will be set to an array with the
elements: (1) the start of the line (2) the word before the cursor (3) any
non\-word characters between that word and the cursor (4) any non\-word
character at the cursor position plus any remaining non\-word characters
before the next word, including all characters specified by the
\fBskip\-chars\fP style, (5) the word at or following the cursor (6) any
non\-word characters following that word (7) the remainder of the line\&.  Any
of the elements may be an empty string; the calling function should test
for this to decide whether it can perform its function\&.
.PP
If the variable \fBmatched_words\fP is defined by the caller to
\fBmatch\-words\-by\-style\fP as an associative array (\fBlocal \-A
matched_words\fP), then the seven values given above should be retrieved
from it as elements named \fBstart\fP, \fBword\-before\-cursor\fP,
\fBws\-before\-cursor\fP, \fBws\-after\-cursor\fP, \fBword\-after\-cursor\fP,
\fBws\-after\-word\fP, and \fBend\fP\&.  In addition the element
\fBis\-word\-start\fP is 1 if the cursor is on the start of a word or
subword, or on white space before it (the cases can be distinguished by
testing the \fBws\-after\-cursor\fP element) and 0 otherwise\&.  This form is
recommended for future compatibility\&.

This function allows you to compose characters that don\&'t appear on the

two keys corresponding to ASCII characters (there is no prompt)\&.  For
accented characters, the two keys are a base character followed by a code

together form a mnemonic for the character to be inserted\&.  The
two\-character codes are a subset of those given by RFC 1345 (see for
example \fBhttp://www\&.faqs\&.org/rfcs/rfc1345\&.html\fP)\&.

The function may optionally be followed by up to two characters which
replace one or both of the characters read from the keyboard; if both
characters are supplied, no input is read\&.  For example,
\fBinsert\-composed\-char a:\fP can be used within a widget to insert an a with
umlaut into the command line\&.  This has the advantages over use of a
literal character that it is more portable\&.

\fBnarrow\-to\-region\fP may be used as a widget or called as a function from a
user\-defined widget; by default, the text outside the editable area remains
visible\&.  A \fBrecursive\-edit\fP is performed and the original widening
status is then restored\&.  Various options and arguments are available when
it is called as a function\&.

The options \fB\-p\fP \fIpretext\fP and \fB\-P\fP \fIposttext\fP may be

The option \fB\-S\fP \fIstatepm\fP is used to narrow according to the other
options while saving the original state in the parameter with name
\fIstatepm\fP, while the option \fB\-R\fP \fIstatepm\fP is used to restore the
state from the parameter; note in both cases the \fIname\fP of the parameter
is required\&.  In the second case, other options and arguments are
irrelevant\&.  When this method is used, no \fBrecursive\-edit\fP is performed;
the calling widget should call this function with the option \fB\-S\fP,
perform its own editing on the command line or pass control to the user
via `\fBzle recursive\-edit\fP\&', then call this function with the option
\fB\-R\fP\&.  The argument \fIstatepm\fP must be a suitable name for an ordinary

\fBpredict\-on\fP
This set of functions implements predictive typing using history search\&.
After \fBpredict\-on\fP, typing characters causes the editor to look backward
in the history for the first line beginning with what you have typed so
far\&.  After \fBpredict\-off\fP, editing returns to normal for the line found\&.
In fact, you often don\&'t even need to use \fBpredict\-off\fP, because if the
line doesn\&'t match something in the history, adding a key performs
standard completion, and then inserts itself if no completions were found\&.
However, editing in the middle of a line is liable to confuse prediction;
see the \fBtoggle\fP style below\&.
.RS
.PP
With the function based completion system (which is needed for this), you
should be able to type \fBTAB\fP at almost any point to advance the cursor
to the next ``interesting\&'' character position (usually the end of the
current word, but sometimes somewhere in the middle of the word)\&.  And of
course as soon as the entire line is what you want, you can accept with
return, without needing to move the cursor to the end first\&.

\fBread\-from\-minibuffer\fP
This is most useful when called as a function from inside a widget, but will
work correctly as a widget in its own right\&.  It prompts for a value
below the current command line; a value may be input using all of the
standard zle operations (and not merely the restricted set available
when executing, for example, \fBexecute\-named\-cmd\fP)\&.  The value is then
returned to the calling function in the parameter \fB$REPLY\fP and the
editing buffer restored to its previous state\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP), the function returns status 1
and \fB$REPLY\fP is not set\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fB? \fP\&' is used\&.  If two arguments are supplied, they are the
prompt and the initial value of \fB$LBUFFER\fP, and if a third argument is
given it is the initial value of \fB$RBUFFER\fP\&.  This provides a default
value and starting cursor placement\&.  Upon return the entire buffer is the
value of \fB$REPLY\fP\&.
.PP
One option is available: `\fB\-k\fP \fInum\fP\&' specifies that \fInum\fP
characters are to be read instead of a whole line\&.  The line editor is not
invoked recursively in this case, so depending on the terminal settings
the input may not be visible, and only the input keys are placed in
\fB$REPLY\fP, not the entire buffer\&.  Note that unlike the \fBread\fP builtin
\fInum\fP must be given; there is no default\&.

\fBreplace\-string\-again\fP, \fBreplace\-pattern\-again\fP
The function \fBreplace\-string\fP implements three widgets\&.
If defined under the same name as the function, it prompts for two
strings; the first (source) string will be replaced by the second
everywhere it occurs in the line editing buffer\&.
.RS
.PP
If the widget name contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&', for example by
defining the widget using the command `\fBzle \-N replace\-pattern
replace\-string\fP\&', then the matching is performed using zsh patterns\&.  All
zsh extended globbing patterns can be used in the source string; note
that unlike filename generation the pattern does not need to match an
entire word, nor do glob qualifiers have any effect\&.  In addition, the
replacement string can contain parameter or command substitutions\&.
Furthermore, a `\fB&\fP\&' in the replacement string will be replaced with
the matched source string, and a backquoted digit `\fB\e\fP\fIN\fP\&' will be
replaced by the \fIN\fPth parenthesised expression matched\&.  The form
`\fB\e{\fP\fIN\fP\fB}\fP\&' may be used to protect the digit from following
digits\&.
.PP
If the widget instead contains the word `\fBregex\fP\&' (or `\fBregexp\fP'),
then the matching is performed using regular expressions, respecting
the setting of the option \fBRE_MATCH_PCRE\fP (see the description of the
function \fBregexp\-replace\fP below)\&.  The special replacement facilities
described above for pattern matching are available\&.
.PP
By default the previous source or replacement string will not be offered
for editing\&.  However, this feature can be activated by setting the style
\fBedit\-previous\fP in the context \fB:zle:\fP\fIwidget\fP (for example,
\fB:zle:replace\-string\fP) to \fBtrue\fP\&.  In addition, a positive
numeric argument forces the previous values to be offered, a negative or
zero argument forces them not to be\&.
.PP
The function \fBreplace\-string\-again\fP can be used to repeat the previous
replacement; no prompting is done\&.  As with \fBreplace\-string\fP, if the name
of the widget contains the word `\fBpattern\fP\&' or `\fBregex\fP', pattern or
regular expression matching is performed, else a literal string
replacement\&.  Note that the previous source and replacement text are the
same whether pattern, regular expression or string matching is used\&.
.PP
In addition, \fBreplace\-string\fP shows the previous replacement above
the prompt, so long as there was one during the current session; if the
source string is empty, that replacement will be repeated without
the widget prompting for a replacement string\&.
.PP
For example, starting from the line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains fan and fond\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
and invoking \fBreplace\-pattern\fP with the source string
`\fBf(?)n\fP\&' and
the replacement string `\fBc\e1r\fP\&' produces the not very useful line:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint This line contains car and cord\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The range of the replacement string can be limited by using the
\fBnarrow\-to\-region\-invisible\fP widget\&.  One limitation of the current
version is that \fBundo\fP will cycle through changes to the replacement
and source strings before undoing the replacement itself\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBsend\-invisible\fP
This is similar to read\-from\-minibuffer in that it may be called as a
function from a widget or as a widget of its own, and interactively reads
input from the keyboard\&.  However, the input being typed is concealed and
a string of asterisks (`\fB*\fP\&') is shown instead\&.  The value is saved in
the parameter \fB$INVISIBLE\fP to which a reference is inserted into the
editing buffer at the restored cursor position\&.  If the read was aborted
by a keyboard break (typically \fB^G\fP) or another escape from editing such
as \fBpush\-line\fP, \fB$INVISIBLE\fP is set to empty and the original buffer
is restored unchanged\&.
.RS
.PP
If one argument is supplied to the function it is taken as a prompt,
otherwise `\fBNon\-echoed text: \fP\&' is used (as in emacs)\&.  If a second and
third argument are supplied they are used to begin and end the reference
to \fB$INVISIBLE\fP that is inserted into the buffer\&.  The default is to

Otherwise, the rightmost ``interesting\&'' word from the previous command is
found and inserted\&.  The default definition of ``interesting\&'' is that the
word contains at least one alphabetic character, slash, or backslash\&.
This definition may be overridden by use of the \fBmatch\fP style\&.  The
context used to look up the style is the widget name, so usually the

Transpose the current line with the previous line and move the cursor

.PP
With a negative numeric argument, requires two lines above the
cursor\&.  These two lines are transposed and the cursor moved to the

number of lines\&.

`\fBnoglob\fP\&' modifier\&.  When the first word on the line matches one of the
values \fIand\fP the URL refers to a local file (see \fBurl\-local\-schema\fP),
only the \fBurl\-seps\fP characters are quoted; the \fBurl\-metas\fP are left
alone, allowing them to affect command\-line parsing, completion, etc\&.  The
default values are a literal `\fBnoglob\fP\&' plus (when the \fBzsh/parameter\fP

`\fBurlglobber\fP\&' or its alias `\fBgloburl\fP'\&.

\fBurl\-local\-schema\fP

relative to a web\-server\-defined document root\&.  The defaults are
"\fBftp\fP" and "\fBfile\fP"\&.

\fBurl\-other\-schema\fP
Like \fBurl\-local\-schema\fP, but lists all other URI schema upon which
\fBurlglobber\fP and \fBurl\-quote\-magic\fP should act\&.  If the URI on the
command line does not have a scheme appearing either in this list or in
\fBurl\-local\-schema\fP, it is not magically quoted\&.  The default values are
"\fBhttp\fP", "\fBhttps\fP", and "\fBftp\fP"\&.  When a scheme appears both here
and in \fBurl\-local\-schema\fP, it is quoted differently depending on whether
the command name appears in \fBurl\-globbers\fP\&.

Loading \fBurl\-quote\-magic\fP also defines a helper function `\fBurlglobber\fP\&'

\fBcomplete\fP
The cursor is left where it was when completion finished, but only if
it is after a character equal to the one just inserted by the user\&.  If 
it is after another character, this value is the same as `\fBkey\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBkey\fP
The cursor is left
after the \fIn\fPth occurrence of the character just inserted, where
\fIn\fP is the number of times that character appeared in the word
before completion was attempted\&.  In short, this has the effect of
leaving the cursor after the character just typed even if the
completion code found out that no other characters need to be inserted

\fBstop\-keys\fP
This style is used by the \fBincremental\-complete\-word\fP widget\&.  Its value

\fBtoggle\fP
This boolean style is used by \fBpredict\-on\fP and its related widgets in
the context `\fB:predict\fP\&'\&.  If set to one of the standard `true' values,
predictive typing is automatically toggled off in situations where it is
unlikely to be useful, such as when editing a multi\-line buffer or after
moving into the middle of a line and then deleting a character\&.  The
default is to leave prediction turned on until an explicit call to
\fBpredict\-off\fP\&.

\fBverbose\fP
This boolean style is used by \fBpredict\-on\fP and its related widgets in
the context `\fB:predict\fP\&'\&.  If set to one of the standard `true' values,

is toggled\&.  This is most useful in combination with the \fBtoggle\fP style\&.
The default does not display these messages\&.

\fBwidget\fP
This style is similar to the \fBcommand\fP style: For widget functions that
use \fBzle\fP to call other widgets, this style can sometimes be used to

.SH "EXCEPTION HANDLING"
.PP
Two functions are provided to enable zsh to provide exception handling in a
form that should be familiar from other languages\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBthrow\fP \fIexception\fP
The function \fBthrow\fP throws the named \fIexception\fP\&.  The name is
an arbitrary string and is only used by the \fBthrow\fP and \fBcatch\fP
functions\&.  An exception is for the most part treated the same as a
shell error, i\&.e\&. an unhandled exception will cause the shell to abort all
processing in a function or script and to return to the top level in an
interactive shell\&.
.TP
\fBcatch\fP \fIexception\-pattern\fP
The function \fBcatch\fP returns status zero if an exception was thrown and
the pattern \fIexception\-pattern\fP matches its name\&.  Otherwise it
returns status 1\&.  \fIexception\-pattern\fP is a standard
shell pattern, respecting the current setting of the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP
option\&.  An alias \fBcatch\fP is also defined to prevent the argument to the
function from matching filenames, so patterns may be used unquoted\&.  Note
that as exceptions are not fundamentally different from other shell errors
it is possible to catch shell errors by using an empty string as the
exception name\&.  The shell variable \fBCAUGHT\fP is set by \fBcatch\fP to the
name of the exception caught\&.  It is possible to rethrow an exception by
calling the \fBthrow\fP function again once an exception has been caught\&.
.PP
The functions are designed to be used together with the \fBalways\fP construct
described in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.  This is important as only this
construct provides the required support for exceptions\&.  A typical example
is as follows\&.
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB{
  # "try" block
  # \&.\&.\&. nested code here calls "throw MyExcept"
} always {
  # "always" block

  elif catch \&''; then

If all exceptions should be caught, the following idiom might be

    case $CAUGHT in
      (MyExcept)

      ;;
      (*)
      print "Caught some other exception"
      ;;
    esac
  fi
}\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
In common with exception handling in other languages, the exception may be
thrown by code deeply nested inside the `try\&' block\&.  However, note that it
must be thrown inside the current shell, not in a subshell forked for a
pipeline, parenthesised current\-shell construct, or some form of
command or process substitution\&.
.PP
The system internally uses the shell variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP to record the
name of the exception between throwing and catching\&.  One drawback of this
scheme is that if the exception is not handled the variable \fBEXCEPTION\fP
remains set and may be incorrectly recognised as the name of an exception
if a shell error subsequently occurs\&.  Adding \fBunset EXCEPTION\fP at the
start of the outermost layer of any code that uses exception handling will
eliminate this problem\&.
.PP
.SH "MIME FUNCTIONS"
.PP
Three functions are available to provide handling of files recognised by
extension, for example to dispatch a file \fBtext\&.ps\fP when executed as a
command to an appropriate viewer\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD 0
\fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP [ \fB\-fv\fP ] [ \fB\-l\fP [ \fIsuffix\fP \&.\&.\&. ] ]
.TP
.PD
\fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP [ \fB\-l\fP ] \fIcommand argument\fP \&.\&.\&.
These two functions use the files \fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fB/etc/mime\&.types\fP,
which associate types and extensions, as well as \fB~/\&.mailcap\fP and
\fB/etc/mailcap\fP files, which associate types and the programs that
handle them\&.  These are provided on many systems with the Multimedia
Internet Mail Extensions\&.
.RS
.PP
To enable the system, the function \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP should be
autoloaded and run\&.  This allows files with extensions to be treated
as executable; such files be completed by the function completion system\&.
The function \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP should not need to be called by the
user\&.
.PP
The system works by setting up suffix aliases with `\fBalias \-s\fP\&'\&.
Suffix aliases already installed by the user will not be overwritten\&.
.PP
For suffixes defined in lower case, upper case variants will also
automatically be handled (e\&.g\&. \fBPDF\fP is automatically handled if
handling for the suffix \fBpdf\fP is defined), but not vice versa\&.
.PP
Repeated calls to \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP do not override the existing
mapping between suffixes and executable files unless the option \fB\-f\fP
is given\&.  Note, however, that this does not override existing suffix
aliases assigned to handlers other than \fBzsh\-mime\-handler\fP\&.
.PP
Calling \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP with the option \fB\-l\fP lists the existing
mappings without altering them\&.  Suffixes to list (which may contain
pattern characters that should be quoted from immediate interpretation
on the command line) may be given as additional arguments, otherwise
all suffixes are listed\&.
.PP
Calling \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP with the option
\fB\-v\fP causes verbose output to be shown during the setup operation\&.
.PP
The system respects the \fBmailcap\fP flags \fBneedsterminal\fP and
\fBcopiousoutput\fP; see \fImailcap\fP(4) or \fImailcap\fP(5)
(the man page\&'s name varies across platforms)\&.
.PP
The functions use the following styles, which are defined with the
\fBzstyle\fP builtin command (see \fIzshmodules\fP(1))\&.  They should be defined
before \fBzsh\-mime\-setup\fP is run\&.  The contexts used all
start with \fB:mime:\fP, with additional components in some cases\&.
It is recommended that a trailing \fB*\fP (suitably quoted) be appended
to style patterns in case the system is extended in future\&.  Some
examples are given below\&.
.PP
For files that have multiple suffixes, e\&.g\&. \fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP, where the
context includes the suffix it will be looked up starting with the
longest possible suffix until a match for the style is found\&.
For example, if \fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP produces a match for the handler, that
will be used; otherwise the handler for \fB\&.gz\fP will be used\&.  Note
that, owing to the way suffix aliases work, it is always required that
there be a handler for the shortest possible suffix, so in this example
\fB\&.pdf\&.gz\fP can only be handled if \fB\&.gz\fP is also handled (though
not necessarily in the same way)\&.  Alternatively, if no handling
for \fB\&.gz\fP on its own is needed, simply adding the command
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias \-s gz=zsh\-mime\-handler\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
to the initialisation code is sufficient; \fB\&.gz\fP will not be handled
on its own, but may be in combination with other suffixes\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBcurrent\-shell\fP
If this boolean style is true, the mailcap handler for the context in
question is run using the \fBeval\fP builtin instead of by starting a new
\fBsh\fP process\&.  This is more efficient, but may not work in the occasional
cases where the mailcap handler uses strict POSIX syntax\&.
.TP
\fBdisown\fP
If this boolean style is true, mailcap handlers started in the
background will be disowned, i\&.e\&. not subject to job control within
the parent shell\&.  Such handlers nearly always produce their own
windows, so the only likely harmful side effect of setting the style is
that it becomes harder to kill jobs from within the shell\&.
.TP
\fBexecute\-as\-is\fP
This style gives a list of patterns to be matched against files
passed for execution with a handler program\&.  If the file matches
the pattern, the entire command line is executed in its current form,
with no handler\&.  This is useful for files which might have suffixes
but nonetheless be executable in their own right\&.  If the style
is not set, the pattern \fB*(*) *(/)\fP is used;
hence executable files are executed directly and not passed to a
handler, and the option \fBAUTO_CD\fP may be used to change to directories
that happen to have MIME suffixes\&.
.TP
\fBexecute\-never\fP
This style is useful in combination with \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.  It is
set to an array of patterns corresponding to full paths to files that
should never be treated as executable, even if the file passed to
the MIME handler matches \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.  This is useful for file
systems that don\&'t handle execute permission or that contain executables
from another operating system\&.  For example, if \fB/mnt/windows\fP is a
Windows mount, then
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzstyle \&':mime:*' execute\-never '/mnt/windows/*'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will ensure that any files found in that area will be executed as MIME
types even if they are executable\&.  As this example shows, the complete
file name is matched against the pattern, regardless of how the file
was passed to the handler\&.  The file is resolved to a full path using
the \fB:P\fP modifier described in
the subsection `Modifiers\&' in \fIzshexpn\fP(1);
this means that symbolic links are resolved where possible, so that
links into other file systems behave in the correct fashion\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBfile\-path\fP
Used if the style \fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP is true for the same context\&.
Set to an array of directories that are used for searching for the
file to be handled; the default is the command path given by the
special parameter \fBpath\fP\&.  The shell option \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is respected;
if that is set, the appropriate path will be searched even if the
name of the file to be handled as it appears on the command line contains
a `\fB/\fP\&'\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBfind\-file\-in\-path\fP
If set, allows files whose names do not contain absolute paths
to be searched for in the command path or the path specified by the
\fBfile\-path\fP style\&.  If the file is not found in the path, it is looked
for locally (whether or not the current directory is in the path); if it is
not found locally, the handler will abort unless the \fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
style is set\&.  Files found in the path are tested as described for
the style \fBexecute\-as\-is\fP\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBflags\fP
Defines flags to go with a handler; the context is as for the
\fBhandler\fP style, and the format is as for the flags in \fBmailcap\fP\&.
.TP
\fBhandle\-nonexistent\fP
By default, arguments that don\&'t correspond to files are not passed
to the MIME handler in order to prevent it from intercepting commands found
in the path that happen to have suffixes\&.  This style may be set to
an array of extended glob patterns for arguments that will be passed to the
handler even if they don\&'t exist\&.  If it is not explicitly set it
defaults to \fB[[:alpha:]]#:/*\fP which allows URLs to be passed to the MIME
handler even though they don\&'t exist in that format in the file system\&.
The full context is \fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, as described for the style
\fBhandler\fP\&.
.TP
\fBhandler\fP
Specifies a handler for a suffix; the suffix is given by the context as
\fB:mime:\&.\fP\fIsuffix\fP\fB:\fP, and the format of the handler is exactly
that in \fBmailcap\fP\&.  Note in particular the `\fB\&.\fP\&' and trailing colon
to distinguish this use of the context\&.  This overrides any handler
specified by the \fBmailcap\fP files\&.  If the handler requires a terminal,
the \fBflags\fP style should be set to include the word \fBneedsterminal\fP,
or if the output is to be displayed through a pager (but not if the
handler is itself a pager), it should include \fBcopiousoutput\fP\&.

\fBmailcap\-priorities\fP
This style is used to resolve multiple mailcap entries for the same MIME
type\&.  It consists of an array of the following elements, in descending

nothing, no handler was installed:  this is most likely because no
handler was found in the \fB\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fBmailcap\fP combination for
\fB\&.ext\fP files\&.  In that case, appropriate handling should be added to
\fB~/\&.mime\&.types\fP and \fBmailcap\fP\&.

integer arithmetic, which is not how an ordinary desk calculator
operates\&.  To force floating point operation, pass the option \fB\-f\fP;
see further notes below\&.
.PP
If the file \fB~/\&.zcalcrc\fP exists it will be sourced inside the function
once it is set up and about to process the command line\&.  This
can be used, for example, to set shell options; \fBemulate \-L zsh\fP
and \fBsetopt extendedglob\fP are in effect at this point\&.  Any
failure to source the file if it exists is treated as fatal\&.
As with other initialisation files, the directory \fB$ZDOTDIR\fP is used
instead of \fB$HOME\fP if it is set\&.
.PP
The mathematical library \fBzsh/mathfunc\fP will be loaded if it is
available; see
the section `The zsh/mathfunc Module\&' in \fIzshmodules\fP(1)\&.  The mathematical functions
correspond to the raw system libraries, so trigonometric functions are
evaluated using radians, and so on\&.
.PP
Each line typed is evaluated as an expression\&.  The prompt shows a number,
which corresponds to a positional parameter where the result of that
calculation is stored\&.  For example, the result of the calculation on the
line preceded by `\fB4> \fP\&' is available as \fB$4\fP\&.  The last value
calculated is available as \fBans\fP\&.  Full command line editing, including
the history of previous calculations, is available; the history is saved in
the file \fB~/\&.zcalc_history\fP\&.  To exit, enter a blank line or type `\fB:q\fP\&'
on its own (`\fBq\fP\&' is allowed for historical compatibility)\&.
.PP
A line ending with a single backslash is treated in the same fashion
as it is in command line editing:  the backslash is removed, the
function prompts for more input (the prompt is preceded by `\fB\&.\&.\&.\fP\&'
to indicate this), and the lines are combined into one to get the final
result\&.  In addition, if the input so far contains more open than
close parentheses \fBzcalc\fP will prompt for more input\&.
.PP
If arguments are given to \fBzcalc\fP on start up, they are used to prime the
first few positional parameters\&.  A visual indication of this is given when
the calculator starts\&.
.PP
The constants \fBPI\fP (3\&.14159\&.\&.\&.) and \fBE\fP (2\&.71828\&.\&.\&.) are provided\&.
Parameter assignment is possible, but note that all parameters will be
put into the global namespace unless the \fB:local\fP special command is
used\&.  The function creates local variables whose names start with
\fB_\fP, so users should avoid doing so\&.  The variables \fBans\fP (the last
answer) and \fBstack\fP (the stack in RPN mode) may be referred to
directly; \fBstack\fP is an array but elements of it are numeric\&.  Various
other special variables are used locally with their standard meaning,
for example \fBcompcontext\fP, \fBmatch\fP, \fBmbegin\fP, \fBmend\fP, \fBpsvar\fP\&.
.PP
The output base can be initialised by passing the option `\fB\-#\fP\fIbase\fP\&',
for example `\fBzcalc \-#16\fP\&' (the `\fB#\fP' may have to be quoted, depending
on the globbing options set)\&.
.PP
If the option `\fB\-e\fP\&' is set, the function runs non\-interactively:
the arguments are treated as expressions to be evaluated as if entered
interactively line by line\&.
.PP
If the option `\fB\-f\fP\&' is set, all numbers are treated as floating
point, hence for example the expression `\fB3/4\fP\&' evaluates to 0\&.75
rather than 0\&.  Options must appear in separate words\&.
.PP
If the option `\fB\-r\fP\&' is set, RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) mode is
entered\&.  This has various additional properties:
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
Stack
Evaluated values are maintained in a stack; this is contained in
an array named \fBstack\fP with the most recent value in \fB${stack[1]}\fP\&.
.TP
Operators and functions
If the line entered matches an operator (\fB+\fP, \fB\-\fP, \fB*\fP,
\fB/\fP, \fB**\fP, \fB^\fP, \fB|\fP or \fB&\fP) or a function supplied by the
\fBzsh/mathfunc\fP library, the bottom element or elements of the stack
are popped to use as the argument or arguments\&.  The higher elements
of stack (least recent) are used as earlier arguments\&.  The result is
then pushed into \fB${stack[1]}\fP\&.
.TP
Expressions
Other expressions are evaluated normally, printed, and added to the
stack as numeric values\&.  The syntax within expressions on a single line
is normal shell arithmetic (not RPN)\&.
.TP
Stack listing
If an integer follows the option \fB\-r\fP with no space, then
on every evaluation that many elements of the stack, where available,
are printed instead of just the most recent result\&.  Hence, for example,
\fBzcalc \-r4\fP shows \fB$stack[4]\fP to \fB$stack[1]\fP each time results
are printed\&.
.TP
Duplication: \fB=\fP
The pseudo\-operator \fB=\fP causes the most recent element of
the stack to be duplicated onto the stack\&.
.TP
\fBpop\fP
The pseudo\-function \fBpop\fP causes the most recent element of
the stack to be popped\&.  A `\fB>\fP\&' on its own has the same effect\&.
.TP
\fB>\fP\fIident\fP
The expression \fB>\fP followed (with no space) by a shell identifier
causes the most recent element of the stack to be popped and
assigned to the variable with that name\&.  The variable is
local to the \fBzcalc\fP function\&.
.TP
\fB<\fP\fIident\fP
The expression \fB<\fP followed (with no space) by a shell identifier
causes the value of the variable with that name to be pushed
onto the stack\&.  \fIident\fP may be an integer, in which
case the previous result with that number (as shown before
the \fB>\fP in the standard \fBzcalc\fP prompt) is put on the stack\&.
.TP
Exchange: \fBxy\fP
The pseudo\-function \fBxy\fP causes the most recent two elements of
the stack to be exchanged\&.  `\fB<>\fP\&' has the same effect\&.
.PP
The prompt is configurable via the parameter \fBZCALCPROMPT\fP, which
undergoes standard prompt expansion\&.  The index of the current entry is
stored locally in the first element of the array \fBpsvar\fP, which can be
referred to in \fBZCALCPROMPT\fP as `\fB%1v\fP\&'\&.  The default prompt is
`\fB%1v> \fP\&'\&.
.PP
The variable \fBZCALC_ACTIVE\fP is set within the function and can
be tested by nested functions; it has the value \fBrpn\fP if RPN mode is
active, else 1\&.
.PP
A few special commands are available; these are introduced by a colon\&.
For backward compatibility, the colon may be omitted for certain
commands\&.  Completion is available if \fBcompinit\fP has been run\&.
.PP
The output precision may be specified within zcalc by special commands
familiar from many calculators\&.

\fB[#\fP\fIbase\fP\fB]\fP

hexadecimal output preceded by an indication of the base, or `\fB[##16]\fP\&'
just to display the raw number in the given base\&.  Bases themselves are

\fBzsh\-newuser\-install\fP [ \fB\-f\fP ]
The function presents the user with various options for customizing

\fB$ZDOTDIR/\&.zshrc\fP is used instead if the parameter \fBZDOTDIR\fP is

altering an existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP\&.

By default the function exits immediately if it finds any of the files
\fB\&.zshenv\fP, \fB\&.zprofile\fP, \fB\&.zshrc\fP, or \fB\&.zlogin\fP in the appropriate

self\-explanatory\&.  Menus are present allowing the user to alter
the value of options and parameters\&.  Suggestions for improvements are
always welcome\&.

When the script exits, the user is given the opportunity to save the new
file or not; changes are not irreversible until this point\&.  However,
the script is careful to restrict changes to the file only to a group
marked by the lines `\fB# Lines configured by zsh\-newuser\-install\fP\&' and
`\fB# End of lines configured by zsh\-newuser\-install\fP\&'\&.  In addition,

If the function edits an existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP, it is up to the user
to ensure that the changes made will take effect\&.  For example, if
control usually returns early from the existing \fB\&.zshrc\fP the lines
will not be executed; or a later initialization file may override
options or parameters, and so on\&.  The function itself does not attempt to

\fB\-e\fP option may be used to change the end\-of\-inputs marker\&.  Note that
this does \fInot\fP change the end\-of\-options marker\&.  For example, to use
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&' as the marker:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzargs \-e\&.\&. \-\- **/*(\&.) \&.\&. ls \-ld \-\-\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is a good choice in that example because no plain file can be named
`\fB\&.\&.\fP\&', but the best end\-marker depends on the circumstances\&.
.PP
The options \fB\-i\fP, \fB\-I\fP, \fB\-l\fP, \fB\-L\fP, and \fB\-n\fP differ slightly
from their usage in \fBxargs\fP\&.  There are no input lines for \fBzargs\fP to
count, so \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP count through the \fIinput\fP list, and \fB\-n\fP
counts the number of arguments passed to each execution of \fIcommand\fP,
\fIincluding\fP any \fIarg\fP list\&.  Also, any time \fB\-i\fP or \fB\-I\fP is used,
each \fIinput\fP is processed separately as if by `\fB\-L\fP \fB1\fP\&'\&.
.PP
For details of the other \fBzargs\fP options, see the \fIxargs\fP(1) man page (but note
the difference in function between \fBzargs\fP and \fBxargs\fP) or run
\fBzargs\fP with the \fB\-\fP\fB\-help\fP option\&.

\fBzed \-b\fP
This function uses the ZLE editor to edit a file or function\&.
.RS
.PP
Only one \fIname\fP argument is allowed\&.
If the \fB\-f\fP option is given, the name is taken to be that of
a function; if the function is marked for autoloading, \fBzed\fP searches
for it in the \fBfpath\fP and loads it\&.  Note that functions edited this way
are installed into the current shell, but \fInot\fP written back to the
autoload file\&.  In this case the \fB\-x\fP option specifies that leading
tabs indenting the function according to syntax should be converted into
the given number of spaces; `\fB\-x 2\fP\&' is consistent with the layout
of functions distributed with the shell\&.
.PP
Without \fB\-f\fP, \fIname\fP is the path name of the file to edit, which need
not exist; it is created on write, if necessary\&.  With \fB\-h\fP, the file is
presumed to contain history events\&.
.PP
When no file name is provided for \fB\-h\fP the current shell history is edited
in place\&.  The history is renumbered when zed exits successfully\&.
.PP
When editing history, multi\-line events must have a trailing backslash on
every line before the last\&.
.PP
While editing, the function sets the main keymap to \fBzed\fP and the
vi command keymap to \fBzed\-vicmd\fP\&.  These will be copied from the existing
\fBmain\fP and \fBvicmd\fP keymaps if they do not exist the first time \fBzed\fP
is run\&.  They can be used to provide special key bindings used only in zed\&.
.PP
If it creates the keymap, \fBzed\fP rebinds the return key to insert a line
break and `\fB^X^W\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\fP keymap, and binds
`\fBZZ\fP\&' to accept the edit in the \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymap\&.
.PP
The bindings alone can be installed by running `\fBzed \-b\fP\&'\&.  This is
suitable for putting into a startup file\&.  Note that, if rerun,
this will overwrite the existing \fBzed\fP and \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps\&.
.PP
Completion is available, and styles may be set with the context prefix
`\fB:completion:zed:\fP\&'\&.
.PP
A zle widget \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is available\&.  This can be called
by name from within zed using `\fB\eex zed\-set\-file\-name\fP\&' or can be
bound to a key in either of the \fBzed\fP or \fBzed\-vicmd\fP keymaps after
`\fBzed \-b\fP\&' has been run\&.  When the widget is called, it prompts for
a new name for the file being edited\&.  When zed exits the file will be
written under that name and the original file will be left alone\&.  The
widget has no effect when invoked from `\fBzed \-f\fP\&'\&.  The completion
context is changed to `\fB:completion:zed\-set\-file\-name:\fP\&'\&.  When editing
the current history with `\fBzed \-h\fP\&', the history is first updated and
then the file is written, but the global setting of \fBHISTFILE\fP is not
altered\&.
.PP
While \fBzed\-set\-file\-name\fP is running, zed uses the keymap
\fBzed\-normal\-keymap\fP, which is linked from the main keymap in effect
at the time zed initialised its bindings\&.  (This is to make the return key
operate normally\&.)  The result is that if the main keymap has been changed,
the widget won\&'t notice\&.  This is not a concern for most users\&.

\fB    \fP\fIsrcpat\fP \fIdest\fP 
Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern \fIsrcpat\fP to
corresponding files having names of the form given by \fIdest\fP, where
\fIsrcpat\fP contains parentheses surrounding patterns which will be
replaced in turn by \fB$1\fP, \fB$2\fP, \&.\&.\&. in \fIdest\fP\&.  For example,
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBzmv \&'(*)\&.lis' '$1\&.txt'\fP

.RE

renames `\fBfoo\&.lis\fP\&' to `\fBfoo\&.txt\fP', `\fBmy\&.old\&.stuff\&.lis\fP' to
`\fBmy\&.old\&.stuff\&.txt\fP\&', and so on\&.
.PP
The pattern is always treated as an \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP pattern\&.  Any file
whose name is not changed by the substitution is simply ignored\&.  Any
error (a substitution resulted in an empty string, two substitutions gave
the same result, the destination was an existing regular file and \fB\-f\fP
was not given) causes the entire function to abort without doing
anything\&.
.PP
In addition to pattern replacement, the variable \fB$f\fP can be referred
to in the second (replacement) argument\&.  This makes it possible to
use variable substitution to alter the argument; see examples below\&.
