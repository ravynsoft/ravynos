cindex(options, specifying)
Options are primarily referred to by name.
These names are case insensitive and underscores are ignored.
For example, `tt(allexport)' is equivalent to `tt(A__lleXP_ort)'.

The sense of an option name may be inverted by preceding it with
`tt(no)', so `tt(setopt No_Beep)' is equivalent to `tt(unsetopt beep)'.
This inversion can only be done once, so `tt(nonobeep)' is em(not)
a synonym for `tt(beep)'.  Similarly, `tt(tify)' is not a synonym for
`tt(nonotify)' (the inversion of `tt(notify)').

Some options also have one or more single letter names.
There are two sets of single letter options: one used by default,
and another used to emulate bf(sh)/bf(ksh) (used when the
tt(SH_OPTION_LETTERS) option is set).
The single letter options can be used on the shell command line,
or with the tt(set), tt(setopt) and tt(unsetopt)
builtins, as normal Unix options preceded by `tt(-)'.

The sense of the single letter options may be inverted by using
`tt(PLUS())' instead of `tt(-)'.
Some of the single letter option names refer to an option being off,
in which case the inversion of that name refers to the option being on.
For example, `tt(PLUS()n)' is the short name of `tt(exec)', and
`tt(-n)' is the short name of its inversion, `tt(noexec)'.

In strings of single letter options supplied to the shell at startup,
trailing whitespace will be ignored; for example the string `tt(-f    )'
will be treated just as `tt(-f)', but the string `tt(-f i)' is an error.
This is because many systems which implement the `tt(#!)' mechanism for
calling scripts do not strip trailing whitespace.

It is possible for options to be set within a function scope.  See the
description of the option tt(LOCAL_OPTIONS) below.

cindex(options, description)
In the following list, options set by default in all emulations are marked
<D>; those set by default only in csh, ksh, sh, or zsh emulations are marked
<C>, <K>, <S>, <Z> as appropriate.  When listing options (by `tt(setopt)',
`tt(unsetopt)', `tt(set -o)' or `tt(set +o)'), those turned on by default
appear in the list prefixed with `tt(no)'.  Hence (unless
tt(KSH_OPTION_PRINT) is set), `tt(setopt)' shows all options whose settings
are changed from the default.

the option unset is described in the documentation for the tt(cd)

ifzman(zmanref(zshbuiltins))\

If the option is set, the shell does not test for directories beneath
the local directory (`tt(.)') until after all directories in tt(cdpath)
have been tested, and the tt(cd) and tt(chdir) commands do not recognise
arguments of the form `{tt(PLUS())|tt(-)}var(n)' as directory stack entries.

Also, if the option is set, the conditions under which the shell
prints the new directory after changing to it are modified.  It is
no longer restricted to interactive shells (although printing of
the directory stack with tt(pushd) is still limited to interactive
shells); and any use of a component of tt(CDPATH), including a `tt(.)' but
excluding an empty component that is otherwise treated as `tt(.)', causes
the directory to be printed.

When the current word has a glob pattern, do not insert all the words

cycle through them like tt(MENU_COMPLETE). The matches are generated as if
a `tt(*)' was added to the end of the word, or inserted at the cursor when
tt(COMPLETE_IN_WORD) is set.  This actually uses pattern matching, not
globbing, so it works not only for files but for any completion, such as
options, user names, etc.

Note that when the pattern matcher is used, matching control (for example,
case-insensitive or anchored matching) cannot be used.  This limitation
only applies when the current word contains a pattern; simply turning

cindex(characters, multibyte, in expansion and globbing)
cindex(multibyte characters, in expansion and globbing)
item(tt(MULTIBYTE) <D>)(
Respect multibyte characters when found in strings.
When this option is set, strings are examined using the
system library to determine how many bytes form a character, depending
on the current locale.  This affects the way characters are counted in
pattern matching, parameter values and various delimiters.

The option is on by default if the shell was compiled with
tt(MULTIBYTE_SUPPORT); otherwise it is off by default and has no effect
if turned on.

If the option is off a single byte is always treated as a single
character.  This setting is designed purely for examining strings
known to contain raw bytes or other values that may not be characters
in the current locale.  It is not necessary to unset the option merely
because the character set for the current locale does not contain multibyte
characters.

The option does not affect the shell's editor,  which always uses the
locale to determine multibyte characters.  This is because
the character set displayed by the terminal emulator is independent of
shell settings.

Print a warning message when an existing parameter from an
enclosing function scope, or global, is set in a function

special parameters does not cause a warning.  This is the companion
to tt(WARN_CREATE_GLOBAL) as in this case the warning is only
printed when a parameter is em(not) created.  Where possible,
use of tt(typeset -g) to set the parameter suppresses the error,
but note that this needs to be used every time the parameter is set.
To restrict the effect of this option to a single function scope,
use `tt(functions -W)'.

For example, the following code produces a warning for the assignment
inside the function tt(nested) as that overrides the value within
tt(toplevel)

By default, shell history that is read in from files is split into
words on all white space.  This means that arguments with quoted

When the history file is re-written, we normally write out a copy of
the file named tt($HISTFILE.new) and then rename it over the old one.
However, if this option is unset, we instead truncate the old
history file and write out the new version in-place.  If one of the
history-appending options is enabled, this option only has an effect
when the enlarged history file needs to be re-written to trim it
down to size.  Disable this only if you have special needs, as doing
so makes it possible to lose history entries if zsh gets interrupted
during the save.

When writing out a copy of the history file, zsh preserves the old
file's permissions and group information, but will refuse to write
out a new file if it would change the history file's owner.

This option is a variant of tt(INC_APPEND_HISTORY) in which, where
possible, the history entry is written out to the file after the
command is finished, so that the time taken by the command is recorded
correctly in the history file in tt(EXTENDED_HISTORY) format.  This
means that the history entry will not be available immediately from
other instances of the shell that are using the same history file.

This option is only useful if tt(INC_APPEND_HISTORY) and
tt(SHARE_HISTORY) are turned off.  The three options should be
considered mutually exclusive.

This option both imports new commands from the history file, and also
causes your typed commands to be appended to the history file (the
latter is like specifying tt(INC_APPEND_HISTORY), which should be turned
off if this option is in effect).  The history lines are also output
with timestamps ala tt(EXTENDED_HISTORY) (which makes it easier to find
the spot where we left off reading the file after it gets re-written).

By default, history movement commands visit the imported lines as
well as the local lines, but you can toggle this on and off with the
set-local-history zle binding.  It is also possible to create a zle
widget that will make some commands ignore imported commands, and
some include them.

If you find that you want more control over when commands
get imported, you may wish to turn tt(SHARE_HISTORY) off,
tt(INC_APPEND_HISTORY) or tt(INC_APPEND_HISTORY_TIME) (see above) on,
and then manually import commands whenever you need them using `tt(fc
-RI)'.

item(tt(ALIAS_FUNC_DEF) <S>)(
By default, zsh does not allow the definition of functions using
the `var(name) tt(LPAR()RPAR())' syntax if var(name) was expanded as an
alias: this causes an error.  This is usually the desired behaviour, as
otherwise the combination of an alias and a function based on the same
definition can easily cause problems.

When this option is set, aliases can be used for defining functions.

For example, consider the following definitions as they might
occur in a startup file.

example(alias foo=bar
foo+LPAR()RPAR() {
  print This probably does not do what you expect.
})

Here, tt(foo) is expanded as an alias to tt(bar) before the
tt(LPAR()RPAR()) is encountered, so the function defined would be named
tt(bar).  By default this is instead an error in native mode.  Note that
quoting any part of the function name, or using the keyword
tt(function), avoids the problem, so is recommended when the function
name can also be an alias.

If a command has a non-zero exit status, execute the tt(ZERR)

The behaviour is also disabled inside tt(DEBUG) traps.  In this
case the option is handled specially: it is unset on entry to
the trap.  If the option tt(DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD) is set,
as it is by default, and the option tt(ERR_EXIT) is found to have been set
on exit, then the command for which the tt(DEBUG) trap is being executed is
skipped.  The option is restored after the trap exits.

Non-zero status in a command list containing tt(&&) or tt(||) is ignored
for commands not at the end of the list.  Hence

example(false && true)

does not trigger exit.

If a command has a non-zero exit status, return immediately from the
enclosing function.  The logic is similar to that for tt(ERR_EXIT),
except that an implicit tt(return) statement is executed instead of an
tt(exit).  This will trigger an exit at the outermost level of a
non-interactive script.

Normally this option inherits the behaviour of tt(ERR_EXIT) that
code followed by `tt(&&)' `tt(||)' does not trigger a return.  Hence
in the following:

example(summit || true)

no return is forced as the combined effect always has a zero return
status.

Note. however, that if tt(summit) in the above example is itself a
function, code inside it is considered separately: it may force a return
from tt(summit) (assuming the option remains set within tt(summit)), but
not from the enclosing context.  This behaviour is different from
tt(ERR_EXIT) which is unaffected by function scope.

ifnzman(noderef(Reserved Words))\
ifzman(the section RESERVED WORDS in zmanref(zshmisc)).

Alias expansion takes place while text is being read; hence when this
option is set it does not take effect until the end of any function or
other piece of shell code parsed as one unit.  Note this may
cause differences from other shells even when the option is in
effect.  For example, when running a command with `tt(zsh -c)',
or even `tt(zsh -o posixaliases -c)', the entire command argument is parsed
as one unit, so aliases defined within the argument are not available even
in later lines.  If in doubt, avoid use of aliases in non-interactive

previous versions of the shell, emulations use tt(NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO)

tt($0) if the emulation mode is changed inside a function or script.
To avoid this, explicitly enable tt(POSIX_ARGZERO) in the tt(emulate)

When this option is set the tt(command) builtin can be used to execute
shell builtin commands.  Parameter assignments specified before shell
functions and special builtins are kept after the command completes unless
the special builtin is prefixed with the tt(command) builtin.  Special
builtins are
tt(.),
tt(:),
tt(break),
tt(continue),
tt(declare),
tt(eval),
tt(exit),
tt(export),
tt(integer),
tt(local),
tt(readonly),
tt(return),
tt(set),
tt(shift),
tt(source),
tt(times),
tt(trap) and
tt(unset).

In addition, various error conditions associated with the above builtins
or tt(exec) cause a non-interactive shell to exit and an interactive
shell to return to its top-level processing.

Furthermore, functions and shell builtins are not executed after
an tt(exec) prefix; the command to be executed must be an external
command found in the path.

Furthermore, the tt(getopts) builtin behaves in a POSIX-compatible
fashion in that the associated variable tt(OPTIND) is not made
local to functions, and its value is calculated differently to match
other shells.

Moreover, the warning and special exit code from
tt([[ -o )var(non_existent_option)tt( ]]) are suppressed.

item(tt(POSIX_IDENTIFIERS) <K> <S>)(
When this option is set, only the ASCII characters tt(a) to tt(z), tt(A) to
tt(Z), tt(0) to tt(9) and tt(_) may be used in identifiers (names
of shell parameters and modules).

In addition, setting this option limits the effect of parameter
substitution with no braces, so that the expression tt($#) is treated as
the parameter tt($#) even if followed by a valid parameter name.
When it is unset, zsh allows expressions of the form tt($#)var(name)
to refer to the length of tt($)var(name), even for special variables,
for example in expressions such as tt($#-) and tt($#*).

Another difference is that with the option set assignment to an
unset variable in arithmetic context causes the variable to be created
as a scalar rather than a numeric type.  So after `tt(unset t; (( t = 3
)))'. without tt(POSIX_IDENTIFIERS) set tt(t) has integer type, while with
it set it has scalar type.

When the option is unset and multibyte character support is enabled (i.e. it
is compiled in and the option tt(MULTIBYTE) is set), then additionally any
alphanumeric characters in the local character set may be used in
identifiers.  Note that scripts and functions written with this feature are
not portable, and also that both options must be set before the script
or function is parsed; setting them during execution is not sufficient
as the syntax var(variable)tt(=)var(value) has already been parsed as
a command rather than an assignment.

If multibyte character support is not compiled into the shell this option is
ignored; all octets with the top bit set may be used in identifiers.
This is non-standard but is the traditional zsh behaviour.

This option affects processing of quoted strings.  Currently it only
affects the behaviour of null characters, i.e. character 0 in the
portable character set corresponding to US ASCII.

When this option is not set, null characters embedded within strings
of the form tt($')var(...)tt(') are treated as ordinary characters. The
entire string is maintained within the shell and output to files where
necessary, although owing to restrictions of the library interface
the string is truncated at the null character in file names, environment
variables, or in arguments to external programs.

When this option is set, the tt($')var(...)tt(') expression is truncated at
the null character.  Note that remaining parts of the same string
beyond the termination of the quotes are not truncated.

For example, the command line argument tt(a$'b\0c'd) is treated with
the option off as the characters tt(a), tt(b), null, tt(c), tt(d),
and with the option on as the characters tt(a), tt(b), tt(d).

When this option is set, the usual zsh behaviour of executing
traps for tt(EXIT) on exit from shell functions is suppressed.
In that case, manipulating tt(EXIT) traps always alters the global
trap for exiting the shell; the tt(LOCAL_TRAPS) option is
ignored for the tt(EXIT) trap.

Also, a tt(return) statement executed in a trap with no argument passes
back from the function the value from the surrounding context, not from
code executed within the trap.

Furthermore, if a trap is set to be ignored, this state persists when
a subshell is entered.  Without the option, the trap would be reset to
its default state at this point.

Turn on privileged mode. Typically this is used when script is to be run

example(#!/bin/zsh -p)

The option is enabled automatically on startup if the effective user

turning the option off causes the effective user and group IDs to be set
to the real user and group IDs. Be aware that if that fails the shell may
be running with different IDs than was intended so a script should check
for failure and act accordingly, for example:

example(unsetopt privileged || exit)

The tt(PRIVILEGED) option disables sourcing user startup files.
