cindex(builtin commands)
cindex(commands, builtin)
Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual
entries; these are often referred to in the list below as `tt(flags)' to
avoid confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on the
behaviour of builtin commands.  In this introductory section,
`tt(option)' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should
be familiar to most command line users.

Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (tt(-)).
Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following the
option letter or after white space, for example `tt(print -C3 {1..9})' or
`tt(print -C 3 {1..9})' are equivalent.  Arguments to options are not the
same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which is
which.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a single
word, for example `tt(print -rca -- *)' and `tt(print -r -c -a -- *)' are
equivalent.

Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `tt(+)'
instead of `tt(-)'.  The list below makes clear which commands these
are.

Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear
in a group before any non-option arguments; once the first non-option
argument has been found, option processing is terminated.

All builtin commands other than `tt(echo)' and precommand modifiers,
even those that have no options, can be given the argument `tt(-)tt(-)'
to terminate option processing.  This indicates that the following words
are non-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored.  This is useful in
cases where arguments to the command may begin with `tt(-)'.  For
historical reasons, most builtin commands (including `tt(echo)') also
recognize a single `tt(-)' in a separate word for this purpose; note
that this is less standard and use of `tt(-)tt(-)' is recommended.

startitem()
prefix(-)
findex(.)
item(tt(.) var(file) [ var(arg) ... ])(
Read commands from var(file) and execute them in the current shell
environment.

If var(file) does not contain a slash, or if tt(PATH_DIRS) is set,
the shell looks in the components of tt($path) to find the directory
containing var(file).  Files in the current directory are not read
unless `tt(.)' appears somewhere in tt($path).  If a file named
`var(file)tt(.zwc)' is found, is newer than var(file), and is the
compiled form (created with the tt(zcompile) builtin) of var(file),
then commands are read from that file instead of var(file).

If any arguments var(arg) are given,
they become the positional parameters; the old positional
parameters are restored when the var(file) is done executing.
However, if no arguments are given,
the positional parameters remain those of the calling context,
and no restoring is done.

If var(file) was not found the return status is 127; if var(file) was found
but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return
status is the exit status of the last command executed.
)
findex(NOTRANS(:))
cindex(expanding parameters)
cindex(parameters, expanding)
cindex(doing nothing)
item(tt(:) [ var(arg) ... ])(
This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions is performed
which may have effects on shell parameters.  A zero exit status is returned.
)
findex(alias)
cindex(aliases, defining)
cindex(aliases, listing)
item(tt(alias) [ {tt(PLUS())|tt(-)}tt(gmrsL) ] [ var(name)[tt(=)var(value)] ... ])(
For each var(name) with a corresponding var(value), define an alias
with that value.  A trailing space in var(value) causes the next word
to be checked for alias expansion.  If the tt(-g) flag is present,
define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not
occur in command position:

example(% perldoc --help 2>&1 | grep 'built-in functions'
    -f   Search Perl built-in functions
% alias -g HG='--help 2>&1 | grep'
% perldoc HG 'built-in functions'
    -f   Search Perl built-in functions)

If the tt(-s) flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command
word on a command line is in the form `var(text)tt(.)var(name)', where
var(text) is any non-empty string, it is replaced by the text
`var(value) var(text)tt(.)var(name)'.  Note that var(name) is treated as
a literal string, not a pattern.  A trailing space in var(value) is not
special in this case.  For example,

example(alias -s ps='gv --')

will cause the command `tt(*.ps)' to be expanded to `tt(gv -- *.ps)'.  As
alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `tt(*.ps)' will
then be expanded.  Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from
other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
to create an alias for the command tt(ps)) and the two sets are never
listed together.

For each var(name) with no var(value),
print the value of var(name), if any.  With no arguments, print all
currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases.  If the tt(-m) flag
is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases
matching these patterns are printed.  When printing aliases and one of
the tt(-g), tt(-r) or tt(-s) flags is present, restrict the printing to
global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one
which is neither a global nor a suffix alias.   Using `tt(PLUS())'
instead of `tt(-)', or ending the option list with a single
`tt(PLUS())', prevents the values of the aliases from being printed.

If the tt(-L) flag is present, then print each
alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script.  The exit
status is nonzero if a var(name) (with no var(value)) is given for
which no alias has been defined.

ifzman(the section ALIASING in zmanref(zshmisc))\
ifnzman(noderef(Aliasing)).

findex(autoload)
cindex(functions, autoloading)
cindex(autoloading functions)
item(tt(autoload) [ {tt(PLUS())|tt(-)}tt(RTUXdkmrtWz) ] [ tt(-w) ] [ var(name) ... ])(
vindex(fpath, searching)
See the section `Autoloading Functions' in ifzman(zmanref(zshmisc))\
ifnzman(noderef(Functions)) for full details.  The tt(fpath) parameter
will be searched to find the function definition when the function is
first referenced.

If var(name) consists of an absolute path, the function is defined to
load from the file given (searching as usual for dump files in the given
location).  The name of the function is the basename (non-directory
part) of the file.  It is normally an error if the function is not found
in the given location; however, if the option tt(-d) is given, searching
for the function defaults to tt($fpath).  If a function is loaded by
absolute path, any functions loaded from it that are marked for
tt(autoload) without an absolute path have the load path of the parent
function temporarily prepended to tt($fpath).

If the option tt(-r) or tt(-R) is given, the function is searched for
immediately and the location is recorded internally for use when the
function is executed; a relative path is expanded using the value of
tt($PWD).  This protects against a change to tt($fpath) after the call
to tt(autoload).  With tt(-r), if the function is not found, it is
silently left unresolved until execution; with tt(-R), an error message
is printed and command processing aborted immediately the search fails,
i.e. at the tt(autoload) command rather than at function execution..

The flag tt(-X) may be used only inside a shell function.  It causes the
calling function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately
loaded and executed, with the current array of positional parameters as
arguments.  This replaces the previous definition of the function.  If
no function definition is found, an error is printed and the function
remains undefined and marked for autoloading.  If an argument is given,
it is used as a directory (i.e. it does not include the name of the
function) in which the function is to be found; this may be combined
with the tt(-d) option to allow the function search to default to tt($fpath)
if it is not in the given location.

The flag tt(+X) attempts to load each var(name) as an autoloaded function,
but does em(not) execute it.  The exit status is zero (success) if the
function was not previously defined em(and) a definition for it was found.
This does em(not) replace any existing definition of the function.  The
exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found.  In the latter case the function remains
undefined and marked for autoloading.  If ksh-style autoloading is
enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file
plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal
ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function.
If the tt(-m) flag is also given each var(name) is treated as a
pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match the
pattern are loaded.

With the tt(-t) flag, turn on execution tracing; with tt(-T), turn on
execution tracing only for the current function, turning it off on entry
to any called functions that do not also have tracing enabled.

With the tt(-U) flag, alias expansion is suppressed when the function is
loaded.

With the tt(-w) flag, the var(name)s are taken as names of files compiled
with the tt(zcompile) builtin, and all functions defined in them are
marked for autoloading.

The flags tt(-z) and tt(-k) mark the function to be autoloaded using the
zsh or ksh style, as if the option tt(KSH_AUTOLOAD) were unset or were
set, respectively.  The flags override the setting of the option at the
time the function is loaded.

Note that the tt(autoload) command makes no attempt to ensure the
shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have
any particular value.  For this, the tt(emulate) command can be used:

example(emulate zsh -c 'autoload -Uz var(func)')

arranges that when var(func) is loaded the shell is in native tt(zsh)
emulation, and this emulation is also applied when var(func) is run.

Some of the functions of tt(autoload) are also provided by tt(functions
-u) or tt(functions -U), but tt(autoload) is a more comprehensive
interface.

item(tt(cd) [ tt(-qsLP) ] {tt(PLUS())|tt(-)}var(n))(
Change the current directory.  In the first form, change the
current directory to var(arg), or to the value of tt($HOME) if
var(arg) is not specified.  If var(arg) is `tt(-)', change to the
previous directory.

Otherwise, if var(arg) begins with a slash, attempt to change to the
directory given by var(arg).

If var(arg) does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether
the current directory `tt(.)' occurs in the list of directories contained
in the shell parameter tt(cdpath).  If it does not, first attempt to change
to the directory var(arg) under the current directory, and if that fails
but tt(cdpath) is set and contains at least one element attempt to change
to the directory var(arg) under each component of tt(cdpath) in turn until
successful.  If `tt(.)' occurs in tt(cdpath), then tt(cdpath) is searched
strictly in order so that `tt(.)' is only tried at the appropriate point.

The order of testing tt(cdpath) is modified if the option tt(POSIX_CD)
is set, as described in the documentation for the option.

If no directory is found, the option tt(CDABLE_VARS) is set, and a
parameter named var(arg) exists whose value begins with a slash, treat its
value as the directory.  In that case, the parameter is added to the named
directory hash table.

The second form of tt(cd) substitutes the string var(new)
for the string var(old) in the name of the current directory,
and tries to change to this new directory.

The third form of tt(cd) extracts an entry from the directory
stack, and changes to that directory.  An argument of the form
`tt(PLUS())var(n)' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left
of the list shown by the tt(dirs) command, starting with zero.
An argument of the form `tt(-)var(n)' counts from the right.
If the tt(PUSHD_MINUS) option is set, the meanings of `tt(PLUS())'
and `tt(-)' in this context are swapped.
If the tt(POSIX_CD) option is set, this form of tt(cd) is not recognised
and will be interpreted as the first form.

If the tt(-q) (quiet) option is specified, the hook function tt(chpwd)
and the functions in the array tt(chpwd_functions) are not called.
This is useful for calls to tt(cd) that do not change the environment
seen by an interactive user.

If the tt(-s) option is specified, tt(cd) refuses to change the current
directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.  If the tt(-P) option
is given or the tt(CHASE_LINKS) option is set, symbolic links are resolved
to their true values.  If the tt(-L) option is given symbolic links are
retained in the directory (and not resolved) regardless of the state of
the tt(CHASE_LINKS) option.

alias(chdir)(cd)
module(clone)(zsh/clone)
findex(command)
item(tt(command) [ tt(-pvV) ] var(simple command))(
The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of
a function or builtin and is executed. If the tt(POSIX_BUILTINS) option
is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties
of them are suppressed. The tt(-p) flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in tt($path). With the tt(-v) flag, tt(command)
is similar to tt(whence) and with tt(-V), it is equivalent to tt(whence
-v).

findex(disable)
cindex(disabling commands)
cindex(commands, disabling)
item(tt(disable) [ tt(-afmprs) ] var(name) ...)(
Temporarily disable the var(name)d hash table elements or patterns.  The default
is to disable builtin commands.  This allows you to use an external
command with the same name as a builtin command.  The tt(-a) option
causes tt(disable) to act on regular or global aliases.  The tt(-s)
option causes tt(disable) to act on suffix aliases.  The tt(-f) option causes
tt(disable) to act on shell functions.  The tt(-r) options causes
tt(disable) to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all disabled
hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are printed.
With the tt(-m) flag the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be
quoted to prevent them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash
table elements from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns
are disabled.  Disabled objects can be enabled with the tt(enable)
command.

With the option tt(-p), var(name) ... refer to elements of the
shell's pattern syntax as described in noderef(Filename Generation).
Certain elements can be disabled separately, as given below.

Note that patterns
not allowed by the current settings for the options tt(EXTENDED_GLOB),
tt(KSH_GLOB) and tt(SH_GLOB) are never enabled, regardless of the
setting here.  For example, if tt(EXTENDED_GLOB) is not active,
the pattern tt(^) is ineffective even if `tt(disable -p "^")' has
not been issued.  The list below indicates any option settings
that restrict the use of the pattern.  It should be noted that
setting tt(SH_GLOB) has a wider effect than merely disabling patterns
as certain expressions, in particular those involving parentheses,
are parsed differently.

The following patterns may be disabled; all
the strings need quoting on the command line to prevent them from
being interpreted immediately as patterns and the patterns are
shown below in single quotes as a reminder.

startitem()
item(tt('?'))(
The pattern character tt(?) wherever it occurs, including when preceding
a parenthesis with tt(KSH_GLOB).

only).

Remove the specified var(job)s from the job table; the shell will
no longer report their status, and will not complain if you
try to exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped.
If no var(job) is specified, disown the current job.

If the var(job)s are currently stopped and the tt(AUTO_CONTINUE) option
is not set, a warning is printed containing information about how to
make them running after they have been disowned.  If one of the latter
two forms is used, the var(job)s will automatically be made running,

pindex(BSD_ECHO, use of)
The tt(-E) flag, or the tt(BSD_ECHO) option, can be used to disable
these escape sequences.  In the latter case, tt(-e) flag can be used to
enable them.

Note that for standards compliance a double dash does not terminate
option processing; instead, it is printed directly.  However, a
single dash does terminate option processing, so the first dash,
possibly following options, is not printed, but everything following it
is printed as an argument.  The single dash behaviour is different
from other shells.  For a more portable way of printing text, see
tt(printf), and for a more controllable way of printing text within zsh,
see tt(print).

Without any argument print current emulation mode.

With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified shell
as much as possible.
bf(csh) will never be fully emulated.
If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, tt(zsh)
will be used as a default; more precisely, the tests performed on the
argument are the same as those used to determine the emulation at startup
based on the shell name, see
ifzman(\
the section COMPATIBILITY in zmanref(zsh)

ifnzman(\
noderef(Compatibility)
)\
.  In addition to setting shell options, the command also restores
the pristine state of pattern enables, as if all patterns had been
enabled using tt(enable -p).

If the tt(emulate) command occurs inside a function that has been
marked for execution tracing with tt(functions -t) then the tt(xtrace)
option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other options.
Note that code executed inside the function by the tt(.), tt(source), or
tt(eval) commands is not considered to be running directly from the
function, hence does not provoke this behaviour.

If the tt(-R) switch is given, all settable options
are reset to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause portability
problems in scripts and functions are altered.  If the tt(-L) switch is given,
the options tt(LOCAL_OPTIONS), tt(LOCAL_PATTERNS) and tt(LOCAL_TRAPS)
will be set as
well, causing the effects of the tt(emulate) command and any tt(setopt),
tt(disable -p) or tt(enable -p), and tt(trap) commands to be local to
the immediately surrounding shell
function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation
modes except tt(ksh). The tt(-L) switch is mutually exclusive with the
use of tt(-c) in var(flags).

If there is a single argument and the tt(-l) switch is given, the
options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with the prefix
`tt(no)') are listed.  tt(-l) can be combined with tt(-L) or tt(-R) and
the list will be modified in the appropriate way.  Note the list does
not depend on the current setting of options, i.e. it includes all
options that may in principle change, not just those that would actually
change.

The var(flags) may be any of the invocation-time flags described in
ifnzman(noderef(Invocation))\
ifzman(the section INVOCATION in zmanref(zsh)),
except that `tt(-o EMACS)' and `tt(-o VI)' may not be used.  Flags such
as `tt(+r)'/`tt(+o RESTRICTED)' may be prohibited in some circumstances.

If tt(-c) var(arg) appears in var(flags), var(arg) is evaluated while the
requested emulation is temporarily in effect.  In this case the emulation
mode and all options are restored to their previous values before
tt(emulate) returns.  The tt(-R) switch may precede the name of the shell
to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including tt(-R) in
var(flags).

Use of tt(-c) enables `sticky' emulation mode for functions defined
within the evaluated expression:  the emulation mode is associated
thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed
the emulation (respecting the tt(-R) switch, if present) and all
options are set (and pattern disables cleared)
before entry to the function, and the state is restored after exit.
If the function is called when the sticky emulation is already in
effect, either within an `tt(emulate) var(shell) tt(-c)' expression or
within another function with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit
from the function do not cause options to be altered (except due to
standard processing such as the tt(LOCAL_OPTIONS) option).  This also
applies to functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation;
the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point the
function is loaded as well as when it is run.

For example:

example(emulate sh -c 'fni+LPAR()RPAR() { setopt cshnullglob; }
fno+LPAR()RPAR() { fni; }'
fno)

The two functions tt(fni) and tt(fno) are defined with sticky tt(sh)
emulation.  tt(fno) is then executed, causing options associated
with emulations to be set to their values in tt(sh).  tt(fno) then
calls tt(fni); because tt(fni) is also marked for sticky tt(sh)
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit from it.
Hence the option tt(cshnullglob), turned off by tt(sh) emulation, will
be turned on within tt(fni) and remain on return to tt(fno).  On exit
from tt(fno), the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the
state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation.

The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended
purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable
environment.  More detailed rules follow.
startsitem()
sitem(1.)(The sticky emulation environment provided by `tt(emulate)
var(shell) tt(-c)' is identical to that provided by entry to
a function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being

The tt(fc) command controls the interactive history mechanism.  Note
that reading and writing of history options is only performed if the
shell is interactive.  Usually this is detected automatically, but
it can be forced by setting the tt(interactive) option when starting the
shell.

The first two forms of this command select a range of events from
var(first) to var(last) from the history list.  The arguments var(first)
and var(last) may be specified as a number or as a string.  A negative
number is used as an offset to the current history event number.  A string
specifies the most recent event beginning with the given string.  All
substitutions var(old)tt(=)var(new), if any, are then performed on the
text of the events.

The range of events selected by numbers can be narrowed further by the
following flags.
startsitem()
sitem(tt(-I))(restricts to only internal events (not from tt($HISTFILE)))
sitem(tt(-L))(restricts to only local events (not from other shells, see
tt(SHARE_HISTORY) in ifzman(zmanref(zshoptions))\
ifnzman(noderef(Description of Options)) -- note that tt($HISTFILE) is
considered local when read at startup))
sitem(tt(-m))(takes the first argument as a pattern (which should be
quoted) and only the history events matching this pattern are considered)
endsitem()

If var(first) is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent
event), or to -16 if the tt(-l) flag is given.
If var(last) is not specified, it will be set to var(first),
or to -1 if the tt(-l) flag is given.
However, if the current event has added entries to the history with
`tt(print -s)' or `tt(fc -R)', then the default var(last) for tt(-l)
includes all new history entries since the current event began.

When the tt(-l) flag is given, the resulting events are listed on
standard output.  Otherwise the editor program specified by tt(-e) var(ename)
is invoked on a file containing these history events.  If tt(-e) is not given, the
value of the parameter tt(FCEDIT) is used; if that is not set the value of
the parameter tt(EDITOR) is used; if that is not set a builtin default,
usually `tt(vi)' is used.  If var(ename) is `tt(-)', no editor is invoked.
When editing is complete, the edited command is executed.

The flag `tt(-s)' is equivalent to `tt(-e -)'.
The flag tt(-r) reverses the order of the events and the
flag tt(-n) suppresses event numbers when listing.

endsitem()

cindex(history, stack)
cindex(stack, history)
`tt(fc -p)' pushes the current history list onto a stack and switches to a
new history list.  If the tt(-a) option is also specified, this history list
will be automatically popped when the current function scope is exited, which
is a much better solution than creating a trap function to call `tt(fc -P)'
manually.  If no arguments are specified, the history list is left empty,
tt($HISTFILE) is unset, and tt($HISTSIZE) & tt($SAVEHIST) are set to their
default values.  If one argument is given, tt($HISTFILE) is set to that
filename, tt($HISTSIZE) & tt($SAVEHIST) are left unchanged, and the history
file is read in (if it exists) to initialize the new list.  If a second
argument is specified, tt($HISTSIZE) & tt($SAVEHIST) are instead set to the
single specified numeric value.  Finally, if a third argument is specified,
tt($SAVEHIST) is set to a separate value from tt($HISTSIZE).  You are free to
change these environment values for the new history list however you desire
in order to manipulate the new history list.

`tt(fc -P)' pops the history list back to an older list saved by `tt(fc -p)'.
The current list is saved to its tt($HISTFILE) before it is destroyed
(assuming that tt($HISTFILE) and tt($SAVEHIST) are set appropriately, of
course).  The values of tt($HISTFILE), tt($HISTSIZE), and tt($SAVEHIST) are
restored to the values they had when `tt(fc -p)' was called.  Note that this
restoration can conflict with making these variables "local", so your best
bet is to avoid local declarations for these variables in functions that use
`tt(fc -p)'.  The one other guaranteed-safe combination is declaring these
variables to be local at the top of your function and using the automatic
option (tt(-a)) with `tt(fc -p)'.  Finally, note that it is legal to manually
pop a push marked for automatic popping if you need to do so before the
function exits.

cindex(history, file)
cindex(file, history)
`tt(fc -R)' reads the history from the given file,
`tt(fc -W)' writes the history out to the given file,
and `tt(fc -A)' appends the history out to the given file.
If no filename is specified, the tt($HISTFILE) is assumed.
If the tt(-I) option is added to tt(-R), only those events that are
not already contained within the internal history list are added.
If the tt(-I) option is added to tt(-A) or tt(-W), only those
events that are new since last incremental append/write to
the history file are appended/written.
In any case, the created file will have no more than tt($SAVEHIST)
entries.

item(tt(functions +M) [ tt(-m) ] var(mathfn) ... )(
Equivalent to tt(typeset -f), with the exception of the tt(-c), tt(-x),
tt(-M) and tt(-W) options.  For tt(functions -u) and tt(functions -U),
see tt(autoload), which provides additional options.  For tt(functions -t)
and tt(functions -T), see tt(typeset -f).

The tt(-x) option indicates that any functions output will have
each leading tab for indentation, added by the shell to show syntactic
structure, expanded to the given number var(num) of spaces.  var(num)
can also be 0 to suppress all indentation.

The tt(-W) option turns on the option tt(WARN_NESTED_VAR) for the named
function or functions only.  The option is turned off at the start of
nested functions (apart from anonoymous functions) unless the called
function also has the tt(-W) attribute.

The tt(-c) option causes var(oldfn) to be copied to var(newfn).  The
copy is efficiently handled internally by reference counting.  If
var(oldfn) was marked for autoload it is first loaded and if this
fails the copy fails.  Either function may subsequently be redefined
without affecting the other.  A typical idiom is that var(oldfn) is the
name of a library shell function which is then redefined to call
tt(newfn), thereby installing a modified version of the function.

cindex(defining mathematical functions)
cindex(functions, defining mathematical)

Use of the tt(-M) option may not be combined with any of the options
handled by tt(typeset -f).

tt(functions -M) var(mathfn) defines var(mathfn) as the name of
a mathematical function recognised in all forms of arithmetical expressions;
see
ifzman(the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in zmanref(zshmisc))\
ifnzman(noderef(Arithmetic Evaluation))\
.  By default var(mathfn) may take
any number of comma-separated arguments.  If var(min) is given,
it must have exactly var(min) args; if var(min) and var(max) are
both given, it must have at least var(min) and at most var(max)
args.  var(max) may be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.

By default the function is implemented by a shell function of the same
name; if var(shellfn) is specified it gives the name of the corresponding
shell function while var(mathfn) remains the name used in arithmetical
expressions.  The name of the function in tt($0) is var(mathfn) (not
var(shellfn) as would usually be the case), provided the option
tt(FUNCTION_ARGZERO) is in effect.  The positional parameters in the shell
function correspond to the arguments of the mathematical function call.

The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated inside the shell
function gives the result of the mathematical function.  This is not limited to
arithmetic substitutions of the form tt($+LPAR()+LPAR())var(...)tt(+RPAR()+RPAR()),
but also includes arithmetical expressions evaluated in any other way, including
by the tt(let) builtin,
by tt(+LPAR()+LPAR())var(...)tt(+RPAR()+RPAR()) statements,
and even
by the tt(return) builtin
and
by array subscripts.
Therefore, care must be taken not to use syntactical constructs that perform
arithmetic evaluation after evaluating what is to be the result of the function.
For example:

findex(zmath_cube)
findex(cube)
example(# WRONG
zmath_cube+LPAR()+RPAR() {
  (( $1 * $1 * $1 ))
  return 0
}
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( cube+LPAR()3+RPAR() )))

This will print `tt(0)' because of the tt(return).

Commenting the tt(return) out would lead to a different problem: the
tt(+LPAR()+LPAR())var(...)tt(+RPAR()+RPAR()) statement would become
the last statement in the function, so the em(return status) (tt($?)) of the
function would be non-zero (indicating failure) whenever the em(arithmetic
result) of the function would happen to be zero (numerically):

example(# WRONG
zmath_cube+LPAR()+RPAR() {
  (( $1 * $1 * $1 ))
}
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( cube+LPAR()0+RPAR() )))

Instead, the tt(true) builtin can be used:

example(# RIGHT
zmath_cube+LPAR()+RPAR() {
  (( $1 * $1 * $1 ))
  true
}
functions -M cube 1 1 zmath_cube
print $(( cube+LPAR()3+RPAR() )))

If the additional option tt(-s) is given to tt(functions -M), the
argument to the function is a single string: anything between the
opening and matching closing parenthesis is passed to the function as a
single argument, even if it includes commas or white space.  The minimum
and maximum argument specifiers must therefore be 1 if given.  An empty
argument list is passed as a zero-length string.
Thus, the following string function takes a single argument, including
the commas, and prints 11:

example(stringfn+LPAR()RPAR() { (( $#1 )); true }
functions -Ms stringfn
print $(( stringfn+LPAR()foo,bar,rod+RPAR() )))

tt(functions -M) with no arguments lists all such user-defined functions in
the same form as a definition.  With the additional option tt(-m) and
a list of arguments, all functions whose var(mathfn) matches one of
the pattern arguments are listed.

tt(function +M) removes the list of mathematical functions; with the
additional option tt(-m) the arguments are treated as patterns and
all functions whose var(mathfn) matches the pattern are removed.  Note
that the shell function implementing the behaviour is not removed
(regardless of whether its name coincides with var(mathfn)).

findex(getopts)

item(tt(getopts) var(optstring) var(name) [ var(arg) ... ])(
Checks the var(arg)s for legal options.  If the var(arg)s are omitted,
use the positional parameters.  A valid option argument
begins with a `tt(PLUS())' or a `tt(-)'.  An argument not beginning with
a `tt(PLUS())' or a `tt(-)', or the argument `tt(-)tt(-)', ends the options.
Note that a single `tt(-)' is not considered a valid option argument.
var(optstring) contains the letters that tt(getopts)
recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a `tt(:)', that option
requires an argument.  The options can be
separated from the argument by blanks.

Each time it is invoked, tt(getopts) places the option letter it finds
in the shell parameter var(name), prepended with a `tt(PLUS())' when
var(arg) begins with a `tt(PLUS())'.  The index of the next var(arg)
is stored in tt(OPTIND).  The option argument, if any,
is stored in tt(OPTARG).
vindex(OPTIND, use of)
vindex(OPTARG, use of)

The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning
to tt(OPTIND).  tt(OPTIND) has an initial value of tt(1), and is
normally set to tt(1) upon entry to a shell function and restored
upon exit.  (The tt(POSIX_BUILTINS) option disables this, and also changes
the way the value is calculated to match other shells.)  tt(OPTARG)
is not reset and retains its value from the most recent call to
tt(getopts).  If either of tt(OPTIND) or tt(OPTARG) is explicitly
unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not
stored.  The option itself is still stored in var(name) in this case.

A leading `tt(:)' in var(optstring) causes tt(getopts) to store the
letter of any invalid option in tt(OPTARG), and to set var(name) to
`tt(?)' for an unknown option and to `tt(:)' when a required argument is
missing.  Otherwise, tt(getopts) sets var(name) to `tt(?)' and prints
an error message when an option is invalid.  The exit status is
nonzero when there are no more options.
)
findex(hash)
item(tt(hash) [ tt(-Ldfmrv) ] [ var(name)[tt(=)var(value)] ] ...)(
tt(hash) can be used to directly modify the contents of the command
hash table, and the named directory hash table.  Normally one would
modify these tables by modifying one's tt(PATH)
(for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters
(for the named directory hash table).
The choice of hash table to work on is determined by the tt(-d) option;
without the option the command hash table is used, and with the option the
named directory hash table is used.

A command var(name) starting with a tt(/) is never hashed, whether by
explicit use of the tt(hash) command or otherwise.  Such a command
is always found by direct look up in the file system.

Given no arguments, and neither the tt(-r) or tt(-f) options,
the selected hash table will be listed in full.

The tt(-r) option causes the selected hash table to be emptied.
It will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal fashion.
The tt(-f) option causes the selected hash table to be fully
rebuilt immediately.  For the command hash table this hashes
all the absolute directories in the tt(PATH),
and for the named directory hash table this adds all users' home directories.
These two options cannot be used with any arguments.

The tt(-m) option causes the arguments to be taken as patterns
(which should be quoted) and the elements of the hash table
matching those patterns are printed.  This is the only way to display
a limited selection of hash table elements.

For each var(name) with a corresponding var(value), put `var(name)' in
the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname `var(value)'.
In the command hash table, this means that
whenever `var(name)' is used as a command argument, the shell will try
to execute the file given by `var(value)'.
In the named directory hash table, this means
that `var(value)' may be referred to as `tt(~)var(name)'.

For each var(name) with no
corresponding var(value), attempt to add var(name) to the hash table,
checking what the appropriate tt(value) is in the normal manner for
that hash table.  If an appropriate tt(value) can't be found, then
the hash table will be unchanged.

The tt(-v) option causes hash table entries to be listed as they are
added by explicit specification.  If has no effect if used with tt(-f).

If the tt(-L) flag is present, then each hash table entry is printed in
the form of a call to hash.

IDs, and the tt(-p) flag lists process groups.
If the tt(-r) flag is specified only running jobs will be listed
and if the tt(-s) flag is given only stopped jobs are shown.
If the tt(-d) flag is given, the directory from which the job was
started (which may not be the current directory of the job) will also
be shown.

The tt(-Z) option replaces the shell's argument and environment space with
the given string, truncated if necessary to fit.  This will normally be
visible in tt(ps) (manref(ps)(1)) listings.  This feature is typically
used by daemons, to indicate their state.

Full job control is only available in the top-level interactive shell,
not in commands run in the left hand side of pipelines or within
the tt(LPAR())var(...)tt(RPAR()) construct.  However, a snapshot
of the job state at that point is taken, so it is still possible
to use the tt(jobs) builtin, or any parameter providing job information.
This gives information about the state of jobs at the point the subshell
was created.  If background processes are created within the subshell,
then instead information about those processes is provided.

For example,

example(sleep 10 &    # Job in background
LPAR()             # Shell forks
jobs          # Shows information about "sleep 10 &"
sleep 5 &     # Process in background (no job control)

The argument var(job) can be the process ID of a job
not in the job list.
In the second form, tt(kill -l), if var(sig) is not

var(sig) that is a name, the corresponding signal number is
listed.  For each var(sig) that is a signal number or a number
representing the exit status of a process which was terminated or
stopped by a signal the name of the signal is printed.

On some systems, alternative signal names are allowed for a few signals.
Typical examples are tt(SIGCHLD) and tt(SIGCLD) or tt(SIGPOLL) and
tt(SIGIO), assuming they correspond to the same signal number.  tt(kill
-l) will only list the preferred form, however tt(kill -l) var(alt) will
show if the alternative form corresponds to a signal number.  For example,
under Linux tt(kill -l IO) and tt(kill -l POLL) both output 29, hence
tt(kill -IO) and tt(kill -POLL) have the same effect.

Which of these resource limits are available depends on the system.
var(resource) can be abbreviated to any unambiguous prefix.  It
can also be an integer, which corresponds to the integer defined
for the resource by the operating system.

If argument corresponds to a number which is out of the range of the
resources configured into the shell, the shell will try to read or write
the limit anyway, and will report an error if this fails.  As the shell
does not store such resources internally, an attempt to set the limit will
fail unless the tt(-s) option is present.

var(limit) is a number, with an optional scaling factor, as follows:

startsitem()
sitem(var(n)tt(h))(hours)
sitem(var(n)tt(k))(kilobytes (default))
sitem(var(n)tt(m))(megabytes or minutes)
sitem(var(n)tt(g))(gigabytes)
sitem([var(mm)tt(:)]var(ss))(minutes and seconds)
endsitem()

The tt(limit) command is not made available by default when the
shell starts in a mode emulating another shell.  It can be made available
with the command `tt(zmodload -F zsh/rlimits b:limit)'.

With the `tt(-f)' option the arguments are printed as described by tt(printf).
With no flags or with the flag `tt(-)', the arguments are printed on
the standard output as described by tt(echo), with the following differences:
the escape sequence `tt(\M-)var(x)' (or `tt(\M)var(x)') metafies the character
var(x) (sets the highest bit),
`tt(\C-)var(x)' (or `tt(\C)var(x)') produces a control character
(`tt(\C-@)' and `tt(\C-?)' give the characters NULL and delete),
a character code in octal is represented by `tt(\)var(NNN)'
(instead of `tt(\0)var(NNN)'),
and `tt(\E)' is a synonym for `tt(\e)'.
Finally, if not in an escape
sequence, `tt(\)' escapes the following character and is not printed.

tt(HIST_LEX_WORDS) option active.

for formatting code that may be indented with tabs.  Note that leading
tabs of any argument to print, not just the first, are expanded, even if
tt(print) is using spaces to separate arguments (the column count
is maintained across arguments but may be incorrect on output
owing to previous unexpanded tabs).

The start of the output of each print command is assumed to be aligned
with a tab stop.  Widths of multibyte characters are handled if the
option tt(MULTIBYTE) is in effect.  This option is ignored if other
formatting options are in effect, namely column alignment or
tt(printf) style, or if output is to a special location such as shell
history or the command line editor.

)
findex(printf)
item(tt(printf) [ tt(-v) var(name) ] var(format) [ var(arg) ... ])(
Print the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting
rules are the same as used in C. The same escape sequences as for tt(echo)
are recognised in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in
one of tt(csdiouxXeEfgGn) are handled. In addition to this, `tt(%b)' can be
used instead of `tt(%s)' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be
recognised and `tt(%q)' can be used to quote the argument in such a way
that allows it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format
specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character,
the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to
print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression. See
ifzman(the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in zmanref(zshmisc))\
ifnzman(noderef(Arithmetic Evaluation))
for a description of arithmetic
expressions. With `tt(%n)', the corresponding argument is taken as an
identifier which is created as an integer parameter.

Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order
but they can explicitly specify the var(n)th argument is to be used by
replacing `tt(%)' by `tt(%)var(n)tt($)' and `tt(*)' by `tt(*)var(n)tt($)'.
It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style
with the normal style and the handling of such mixed styles may be subject
to future change.

If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused
until all arguments have been consumed. With the tt(print) builtin, this
can be suppressed by using the tt(-r) option. If more arguments are
required by the format than have been specified, the behaviour is as if
zero or an empty string had been specified as the argument.

The tt(-v) option causes the output to be stored as the value of the
parameter var(name), instead of printed. If var(name) is an array and
the format string is reused when consuming arguments then one
array element will be used for each use of the format string.

Change the current directory, and push the old current directory
onto the directory stack.  In the first form, change the
current directory to var(arg).
If var(arg) is not specified, change to the second directory
on the stack (that is, exchange the top two entries), or
change to tt($HOME) if the tt(PUSHD_TO_HOME)

Otherwise, var(arg) is interpreted as it would be by tt(cd).
The meaning of var(old) and var(new) in the second form is also
the same as for tt(cd).

The third form of tt(pushd) changes directory by rotating the
directory list.  An argument of the form `tt(PLUS())var(n)' identifies a stack
entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the tt(dirs)
command, starting with zero.  An argument of the form `tt(-)var(n)' counts
from the right.  If the tt(PUSHD_MINUS) option is set, the meanings
of `tt(PLUS())' and `tt(-)' in this context are swapped.

If the tt(-q) (quiet) option is specified, the hook function tt(chpwd)
and the functions in the array tt($chpwd_functions) are not called,
and the new directory stack is not printed.  This is useful for calls to
tt(pushd) that do not change the environment seen by an interactive user.

If the option tt(-q) is not specified and the shell option tt(PUSHD_SILENT)

tt(-q) which clears the input queue before reading, or within zle where
other mechanisms should be used to test for input.
ifzman( )
Note that read does not attempt to alter the input processing mode.  The
default mode is canonical input, in which an entire line is read at a time,
so usually `tt(read -t)' will not read anything until an entire line has
been typed.  However, when reading from the terminal with tt(-k)
input is processed one key at a time; in this case, only availability of
the first character is tested, so that e.g. `tt(read -t -k 2)' can still
block on the second character.  Use two instances of `tt(read -t -k)' if
this is not what is wanted.

enditem()

If the first argument contains a `tt(?)', the remainder of this
word is used as a var(prompt) on standard error when the shell
is interactive.

The value (exit status) of tt(read) is 1 when an end-of-file is
encountered, or when tt(-c) or tt(-l) is present and the command is
not called from a tt(compctl) function, or as described for tt(-q).
Otherwise the value is 0.

The behavior of some combinations of the tt(-k), tt(-p), tt(-q), tt(-u)

tt(-p) cancels tt(-u), tt(-k) cancels tt(-z), and otherwise tt(-z)

Set the options for the shell and/or set the positional parameters, or

sort arguments in descending order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see
ifzman(zmanref(zshoptions))\
ifnzman(noderef(Options))\
.  Flags may be specified by name using the tt(-o) option. If no option
name is supplied with tt(-o), the current option states are printed:  see
the description of tt(setopt) below for more information on the format.
With tt(PLUS()o) they are printed in a form that can be used as input
to the shell.

If the tt(-A) flag is specified, var(name) is set to an array containing
the given var(arg)s; if no var(name) is specified, all arrays are printed
together with their values.

If tt(PLUS()A) is used and var(name) is an array, the
given arguments will replace the initial elements of that array; if no
var(name) is specified, all arrays are printed without their values.

The behaviour of arguments after tt(-A) var(name) or tt(PLUS()A) var(name)
depends on whether the option tt(KSH_ARRAYS) is set.  If it is not set, all
arguments following var(name) are treated as values for the array,
regardless of their form.  If the option is set, normal option processing
continues at that point; only regular arguments are treated as values for
the array.  This means that

example(set -A array -x -- foo)

sets tt(array) to `tt(-x -)tt(- foo)' if tt(KSH_ARRAYS) is not set, but sets
the array to tt(foo) and turns on the option `tt(-x)' if it is set.

If the tt(-A) flag is not present, but there are arguments beyond the
options, the positional parameters are set.  If the option list (if any)
is terminated by `tt(-)tt(-)', and there are no further arguments, the
positional parameters will be unset.

If no arguments and no `tt(-)tt(-)' are given, then the names and values of
all parameters are printed on the standard output.  If the only argument is
`tt(PLUS())', the names of all parameters are printed.

For historical reasons, `tt(set -)' is treated as `tt(set +xv)'
and `tt(set -) var(args)' as `tt(set +xv --) var(args)' when in
any other emulation mode than zsh's native mode.

Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either

default options for the current emulation (the default emulation being
native tt(zsh), shown as tt(<Z>) in

Options that are on by default for the emulation are
shown with the prefix tt(no) only if they are off, while other options are

options changed from the default state by the user, any options activated
automatically by the shell (for example, tt(SHIN_STDIN) or tt(INTERACTIVE))

tt(KSH_OPTION_PRINT), however the rationale for choosing options with

If the tt(-m) flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns
(which should be quoted to protect them from filename expansion), and all
options with names matching these patterns are set.

Note that a bad option name does not cause execution of subsequent shell

syntactically, so for example an empty variable expansion may cause an
argument to be omitted; syntax errors cause status 2 to be returned instead
of a shell error; and arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather
than arithmetic expressions.

The command attempts to implement POSIX and its extensions where these
are specified.  Unfortunately there are intrinsic ambiguities in
the syntax; in particular there is no distinction between test operators
and strings that resemble them.  The standard attempts to resolve these
for small numbers of arguments (up to four); for five or more arguments
compatibility cannot be relied on.  Users are urged wherever possible to
use the `tt([[)' test syntax which does not have these ambiguities.

or as the name of a signal either with or without the string tt(SIG)
in front (e.g. 1, HUP, and SIGHUP are all the same signal).

If var(arg) is `tt(-)', then the specified signals are reset to their
defaults, or, if no var(sig) args are present, all traps are reset.

If var(arg) is an empty string, then the specified signals
are ignored by the shell (and by the commands it invokes).

If var(arg) is omitted but one or more var(sig) args are provided (i.e.
the first argument is a valid signal number or name), the effect is the
same as if var(arg) had been specified as `tt(-)'.

The tt(trap) command with no arguments prints a list of commands
associated with each signal.

If var(sig) is tt(ZERR) then var(arg) will be executed
after each command with a nonzero exit status.  tt(ERR) is an alias
for tt(ZERR) on systems that have no tt(SIGERR) signal (this is the
usual case).

If var(sig) is tt(DEBUG) then var(arg) will be executed
before each command if the option tt(DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD) is set
(as it is by default), else after each command.  Here, a `command' is
what is described as a `sublist' in the shell grammar, see
ifnzman(noderef(Simple Commands & Pipelines))\
ifzman(the section SIMPLE COMMANDS & PIPELINES in zmanref(zshmisc)).
If tt(DEBUG_BEFORE_CMD) is set various additional features are available.
First, it is possible to skip the next command by setting the option
tt(ERR_EXIT); see the description of the tt(ERR_EXIT) option in
ifzman(zmanref(zshoptions))\
ifnzman(noderef(Description of Options)).  Also, the shell parameter
tt(ZSH_DEBUG_CMD) is set to the string corresponding to the command
to be executed following the trap.  Note that this string is reconstructed
from the internal format and may not be formatted the same way as the
original text.  The parameter is unset after the trap is executed.

If var(sig) is tt(0) or tt(EXIT)
and the tt(trap) statement is executed inside the body of a function,
then the command var(arg) is executed after the function completes.
The value of tt($?) at the start of execution is the exit status of the
shell or the return status of the function exiting.
If var(sig) is tt(0) or tt(EXIT)
and the tt(trap) statement is not executed inside the body of a function,
then the command var(arg) is executed when the shell terminates; the
trap runs before any tt(zshexit) hook functions.

tt(ZERR), tt(DEBUG), and tt(EXIT) traps are not executed inside other
traps.  tt(ZERR) and tt(DEBUG) traps are kept within subshells, while
other traps are reset.

Note that traps defined with the tt(trap) builtin are slightly different
from those defined as `tt(TRAP)var(NAL) () { ... }', as the latter have
their own function environment (line numbers, local variables, etc.) while
the former use the environment of the command in which they were called.
For example,

example(trap 'print $LINENO' DEBUG)

will print the line number of a command executed after it has run, while

example(TRAPDEBUG+LPAR()RPAR() { print $LINENO; })

will always print the number zero.

Alternative signal names are allowed as described under tt(kill) above.
Defining a trap under either name causes any trap under an alternative
name to be removed.  However, it is recommended that for consistency
users stick exclusively to one name or another.

The tt(-f) option freezes the tty (i.e. terminal or terminal emulator), and

When the tty is frozen, no changes made to the tty settings by
external programs will be honored by the shell, except for changes in the
size of the screen; the shell will
simply reset the settings to their previous values as soon as each
command exits or is suspended.  Thus, tt(stty) and similar programs have
no effect when the tty is frozen.  Freezing the tty does not cause
the current state to be remembered: instead, it causes future changes
to the state to be blocked.

Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or not.

Note that, regardless of whether the tty is frozen or not, the
shell needs to change the settings when the line editor starts, so
unfreezing the tty does not guarantee settings made on the
command line are preserved.  Strings of commands run between
editing the command line will see a consistent tty state.
See also the shell variable tt(STTY) for a means of initialising
the tty before running external commands and/or freezing the tty
around a single command.

Set or display attributes and values for shell parameters.

Except as noted below for control flags that change the behavior,
a parameter is created for each var(name) that does not already refer
to one.  When inside a function, a new parameter is created for every
var(name) (even those that already exist), and is unset again when the
function completes.  See
ifzman(`Local Parameters' in zmanref(zshparam))\
ifnzman(noderef(Local Parameters))\
.  The same rules apply to special shell parameters, which
retain their special attributes when made local.

For each var(name)tt(=)var(value) assignment, the parameter
var(name) is set to var(value).  If the assignment is omitted and var(name)
does em(not) refer to an existing parameter, a new parameter is intialized
to empty string, zero, or empty array (as appropriate), em(unless) the
shell option tt(TYPESET_TO_UNSET) is set.  When that option is set,
the parameter attributes are recorded but the parameter remains unset.

If the shell option tt(TYPESET_SILENT) is not set, for each remaining
var(name) that refers to a parameter that is already set, the name and
value of the parameter are printed in the form of an assignment.
Nothing is printed for newly-created parameters, or when any attribute
flags listed below are given along with the var(name).  Using
`tt(PLUS())' instead of minus to introduce an attribute turns it off.

If no var(name) is present, the names and values of all parameters are
printed.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only
those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `tt(PLUS())'
rather than `tt(-)' to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values
of parameters when there is no parameter name.

All forms of the command handle scalar assignment.  Array assignment is
possible if any of the reserved words tt(declare), tt(export), tt(float),
tt(integer), tt(local), tt(readonly) or tt(typeset) is matched when the
line is parsed (N.B. not when it is executed).  In this case the arguments
are parsed as assignments, except that the `tt(+=)' syntax and the
tt(GLOB_ASSIGN) option are not supported, and scalar values after tt(=)
are em(not) split further into words, even if expanded (regardless of the
setting of the tt(KSH_TYPESET) option; this option is obsolete).

Examples of the differences between command and reserved word parsing:

example(# Reserved word parsing
typeset svar=$(echo one word) avar=(several words))

The above creates a scalar parameter tt(svar) and an array
parameter tt(avar) as if the assignments had been

example(svar="one word"
avar=(several words))

On the other hand:

example(# Normal builtin interface
builtin typeset svar=$(echo two words))

The tt(builtin) keyword causes the above to use the standard builtin
interface to tt(typeset) in which argument parsing is performed in the same
way as for other commands.  This example creates a scalar tt(svar)
containing the value tt(two) and another scalar parameter tt(words) with
no value.  An array value in this case would either cause an error or be
treated as an obscure set of glob qualifiers.

Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of assignments
after command line expansion; however, these only perform scalar
assignment:

example(var='svar=val'
typeset $var)

The above sets the scalar parameter tt(svar) to the value tt(val).
Parentheses around the value within tt(var) would not cause array
assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when tt($var)
is substituted.  Any non-trivial expansion in the name part of the
assignment causes the argument to be treated in this fashion:

example(typeset {var1,var2,var3}=name)

The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of setting the
three parameters to the same value, but the command line is parsed as
a set of three normal command line arguments to tt(typeset) after
expansion.  Hence it is not possible to assign to multiple arrays by
this means.

Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled
separately.  For example, `tt(disable -r typeset)' disables the reserved
word interface to tt(typeset), exposing the builtin interface, while
`tt(disable typeset)' disables the builtin.  Note that disabling the
reserved word interface for tt(typeset) may cause problems with the
output of `tt(typeset -p)', which assumes the reserved word interface is
available in order to restore array and associative array values.

Unlike parameter assignment statements, tt(typeset)'s exit status on an
assignment that involves a command substitution does not reflect the exit
status of the command substitution.  Therefore, to test for an error in
a command substitution, separate the declaration of the parameter from its
initialization:

example(# WRONG
typeset var1=$(exit 1) || echo "Trouble with var1"

# RIGHT
typeset var1 && var1=$(exit 1) || echo "Trouble with var1"
)

To initialize a parameter var(param) to a command output and mark it readonly,
use tt(typeset -r )var(param) or tt(readonly )var(param) after the parameter
assignment statement.

If no attribute flags are given, and either no var(name) arguments are
present or the flag tt(+m) is used, then each parameter name printed is
preceded by a list of the attributes of that parameter (tt(array),
tt(association), tt(exported), tt(float), tt(integer), tt(readonly),
or tt(undefined) for autoloaded parameters not yet loaded).  If tt(+m) is
used with attribute flags, and all those flags are introduced with
tt(PLUS()), the matching parameter names are printed but their values
are not.

The following control flags change the behavior of tt(typeset):

startitem()
item(tt(PLUS()))(
If `tt(PLUS())' appears by itself in a separate word as the last option,
then the names of all parameters (functions with tt(-f)) are printed, but
the values (function bodies) are not.  No var(name) arguments may appear,
and it is an error for any other options to follow `tt(PLUS())'.  The
effect of `tt(PLUS())' is as if all attribute flags which precede it were
given with a `tt(PLUS())' prefix.  For example, `tt(typeset -U PLUS())' is
equivalent to `tt(typeset +U)' and displays the names of all arrays having
the uniqueness attribute, whereas `tt(typeset -f -U PLUS())' displays the
names of all autoloadable functions.  If tt(PLUS()) is the only option,
then type information (array, readonly, etc.) is also printed for each
parameter, in the same manner as `tt(typeset +m "*")'.
)
item(tt(-g))(
The tt(-g) (global) means that any resulting parameter will not be
restricted to local scope.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that
the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any existing
parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function.  This flag does not
affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no effect when listing
existing parameters, nor does the flag tt(+g) have any effect except in
combination with tt(-m) (see below).
)
item(tt(-m))(
If the tt(-m) flag is given the var(name) arguments are taken as patterns
(use quoting to prevent these from being interpreted as file patterns).
With no attribute flags, all parameters (or functions with the tt(-f)
flag) with matching names are printed (the shell option tt(TYPESET_SILENT)
is not used in this case).

If the tt(+g) flag is combined with tt(-m), a new local parameter is
created for every matching parameter that is not already local.  Otherwise
tt(-m) applies all other flags or assignments to the existing parameters.

Except when assignments are made with var(name)tt(=)var(value), using
tt(+m) forces the matching parameters and their attributes to be printed,
even inside a function.  Note that tt(-m) is ignored if no patterns are
given, so `tt(typeset -m)' displays attributes but `tt(typeset -a +m)'
does not.
)
item(tt(-p) [ var(n) ])(
If the tt(-p) option is given, parameters and values are printed in the
form of a typeset command with an assignment, regardless of other flags
and options.  Note that the tt(-H) flag on parameters is respected; no
value will be shown for these parameters.

tt(-p) may be followed by an optional integer argument.  Currently
only the value tt(1) is supported.  In this case arrays and associative
arrays are printed with newlines between indented elements for
readability.
)
item(tt(-T) [ var(scalar)[tt(=)var(value)] var(array)[tt(=LPAR())var(value) ...tt(RPAR())] [ var(sep) ] ])(
This flag has a different meaning when used with tt(-f); see below.
Otherwise the tt(-T) option requires zero, two, or three arguments to be
present.  With no arguments, the list of parameters created in this
fashion is shown.  With two or three arguments, the first two are the name
of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied
together in the manner of tt($PATH) and tt($path).  The optional third
argument is a single-character separator which will be used to join the
elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as
with tt($PATH).  Only the first character of the separator is significant;
any remaining characters are ignored.  Multibyte characters are not
yet supported.

Only one of the scalar and array parameters may be assigned an initial
value (the restrictions on assignment forms described above also apply).

Both the scalar and the array may be manipulated as normal.  If one is
unset, the other will automatically be unset too.  There is no way of
untying the variables without unsetting them, nor of converting the type
of one of them with another tt(typeset) command; tt(+T) does not work,
assigning an array to var(scalar) is an error, and assigning a scalar to
var(array) sets it to be a single-element array.

Note that both `tt(typeset -xT ...)'  and `tt(export -T ...)' work, but
only the scalar will be marked for export.  Setting the value using the
scalar version causes a split on all separators (which cannot be quoted).
It is possible to apply tt(-T) to two previously tied variables but with a
different separator character, in which case the variables remain joined
as before but the separator is changed.

When an existing scalar is tied to a new array, the value of the scalar
is preserved but no attribute other than export will be preserved.
)
enditem()

Attribute flags that transform the final value (tt(-L), tt(-R), tt(-Z),
tt(-l), tt(-u)) are only applied to the expanded value at the point
of a parameter expansion expression using `tt($)'.  They are not applied
when a parameter is retrieved internally by the shell for any purpose. 

The following attribute flags may be specified:

startitem()
item(tt(-A))(
The names refer to associative array parameters; see
ifzman(`Array Parameters' in zmanref(zshparam))\
ifnzman(noderef(Array Parameters))\
.
)
item(tt(-L) [ var(n) ])(
Left justify and remove leading blanks from the value when the parameter
is expanded.
If var(n) is nonzero, it defines the width of the field.
If var(n) is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
the first assignment.  In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the
complete value assigned to the parameter is used to determine the width,
not the value that would be output.

The width is the count of characters, which may be multibyte characters
if the tt(MULTIBYTE) option is in effect.  Note that the screen
width of the character is not taken into account; if this is required,
use padding with parameter expansion flags
tt(${+LPAR()ml)var(...)tt(RPAR())var(...)tt(}) as described in
`Parameter Expansion Flags' in
ifzman(zmanref(zshexpn))ifnzman(noderef(Parameter Expansion)).

When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with
blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the field.
Note truncation can lead to unexpected results with numeric parameters.
Leading zeros are removed if the tt(-Z) flag is also set.
)
item(tt(-R) [ var(n) ])(
Similar to tt(-L), except that right justification is used;
when the parameter is expanded, the field is left filled with
blanks or truncated from the end.  May not be combined with the tt(-Z)
flag.
)
item(tt(-U))(
For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the first
occurrence of each duplicated value.  This may also be set for tied
parameters (see tt(-T)) or colon-separated special parameters like
tt(PATH) or tt(FIGNORE), etc.  Note the flag takes effect on assignment,
and the type of the variable being assigned to is determinative; for
variables with shared values it is therefore recommended to set the flag
for all interfaces, e.g. `tt(typeset -U PATH path)'.

This flag has a different meaning when used with tt(-f); see below.
)
item(tt(-Z) [ var(n) ])(
Specially handled if set along with the tt(-L) flag.
Otherwise, similar to tt(-R), except that leading zeros are used for
padding instead of blanks if the first non-blank character is a digit.
Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible
for padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate
place in the output.
)
item(tt(-a))(
The names refer to array parameters.  An array parameter may be
created this way, but it may be assigned to in the tt(typeset)
statement only if the reserved word form of tt(typeset) is enabled
(as it is by default).  When displaying, both normal and associative
arrays are shown.
)
item(tt(-f))(
The names refer to functions rather than parameters.  No assignments
can be made, and the only other valid flags are tt(-t), tt(-T), tt(-k),
tt(-u), tt(-U) and tt(-z).  The flag tt(-t) turns on execution tracing
for this function; the flag tt(-T) does the same, but turns off tracing
for any named (not anonymous) function called from the present one,
unless that function also
has the tt(-t) or tt(-T) flag.  The tt(-u) and tt(-U) flags cause the
function to be marked for autoloading; tt(-U) also causes alias
expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded.  See the
description of the `tt(autoload)' builtin for details.

Note that the builtin tt(functions) provides the same basic capabilities
as tt(typeset -f) but gives access to a few extra options; tt(autoload)
gives further additional options for the case tt(typeset -fu) and
tt(typeset -fU).
)
item(tt(-h))(
Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `<S>' in the table in
ifzman(zmanref(zshparam))\
ifnzman(noderef(Parameters Set By The Shell))\
), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others.  A special parameter with this attribute will
not retain its special effect when made local.  Thus after `tt(typeset -h
PATH)', a function containing `tt(typeset PATH)' will create an ordinary
local parameter without the usual behaviour of tt(PATH).  Alternatively,
the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a
function `tt(typeset -h PATH)' creates an ordinary local parameter and the
special tt(PATH) parameter is not altered in any way.  It is also possible
to create a local parameter using `tt(typeset +h )var(special)', where the
local copy of var(special) will retain its special properties regardless of
having the tt(-h) attribute.  Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in tt(zsh/mapfile) and tt(zsh/parameter)) are
automatically given the tt(-h) attribute to avoid name clashes.
)
item(tt(-H))(
Hide value: specifies that tt(typeset) will not display the value of the
parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
always as if the `tt(PLUS())' flag had been given.  Use of the parameter is
in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is
specified by name, or by pattern with the tt(-m) option.  This is on by
default for the parameters in the tt(zsh/parameter) and tt(zsh/mapfile)
modules.  Note, however, that unlike the tt(-h) flag this is also useful
for non-special parameters.
)
item(tt(-i) [ var(n) ])(
Use an internal integer representation.  If var(n) is nonzero it
defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it is determined by the
first assignment.  Bases from 2 to 36 inclusive are allowed.
)
item(tt(-E) [ var(n) ])(
Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output
the variable will be converted to scientific notation.  If var(n) is
nonzero it defines the number of significant figures to display; the
default is ten.
)
item(tt(-F) [ var(n) ])(
Use an internal double-precision floating point representation.  On output
the variable will be converted to fixed-point decimal notation.  If var(n)
is nonzero it defines the number of digits to display after the decimal
point; the default is ten.
)
item(tt(-l))(
Convert the result to lower case whenever the parameter is expanded.
The value is em(not) converted when assigned.
)
item(tt(-r))(
The given var(name)s are marked readonly.  Note that if var(name) is a
special parameter, the readonly attribute can be turned on, but cannot then
be turned off.

If the tt(POSIX_BUILTINS) option is set, the readonly attribute is
more restrictive: unset variables can be marked readonly and cannot then
be set; furthermore, the readonly attribute cannot be removed from any
variable.

It is still possible to change other attributes of the variable though,
some of which like tt(-U) or tt(-Z) would affect the value. More generally,
the readonly attribute should not be relied on as a security mechanism.

Note that in zsh (like in pdksh but unlike most other shells) it is
still possible to create a local variable of the same name as this is
considered a different variable (though this variable, too, can be marked
readonly). Special variables that have been made readonly retain their value
and readonly attribute when made local.
)
item(tt(-t))(
Tags the named parameters.  Tags have no special meaning to the shell.
This flag has a different meaning when used with tt(-f); see above.
)
item(tt(-u))(
Convert the result to upper case whenever the parameter is expanded.
The value is em(not) converted when assigned.
This flag has a different meaning when used with tt(-f); see above.
)
item(tt(-x))(
Mark for automatic export to the environment of subsequently
executed commands.  If the option tt(GLOBAL_EXPORT) is set, this implies
the option tt(-g), unless tt(+g) is also explicitly given; in other words
the parameter is not made local to the enclosing function.  This is for
compatibility with previous versions of zsh.

cindex(limits, resource)
item(tt(ulimit) [ tt(-HSa) ] [ { tt(-bcdfiklmnpqrsTtvwx) | tt(-N) var(resource) } [ var(limit) ] ... ])(
Set or display resource limits of the shell and the processes started by
the shell.  The value of var(limit) can be a number in the unit specified
below or one of the values `tt(unlimited)', which removes the limit on the
resource, or `tt(hard)', which uses the current value of the hard limit on
the resource.

By default, only soft limits are manipulated. If the tt(-H) flag
is given use hard limits instead of soft limits.  If the tt(-S) flag is given
together with the tt(-H) flag set both hard and soft limits.

If no options are used, the file size limit (tt(-f)) is assumed.

If var(limit) is omitted the current value of the specified resources are
printed.  When more than one resource value is printed, the limit name and
unit is printed before each value.

When looping over multiple resources, the shell will abort immediately if
it detects a badly formed argument.  However, if it fails to set a limit

Such limits will be shown by number in the output of `tt(ulimit -a)'.

The resources of the shell process are only changed if the tt(-s)
flag is given.

The tt(unlimit) command is not made available by default when the
shell starts in a mode emulating another shell.  It can be made available
with the command `tt(zmodload -F zsh/rlimits b:unlimit)'.

Each named parameter is unset.
Local parameters remain local even if unset; they appear unset within scope,

Individual elements of associative array parameters may be unset by using
subscript syntax on var(name), which should be quoted (or the entire command
prefixed with tt(noglob)) to protect the subscript from filename generation.

If the tt(-m) flag is specified the arguments are taken as patterns (should
be quoted) and all parameters with matching names are unset.  Note that this
cannot be used when unsetting associative array elements, as the subscript
will be treated as part of the pattern.

The tt(-v) flag specifies that var(name) refers to parameters. This is the
default behaviour.

tt(unset -f) is equivalent to tt(unfunction).

item(tt(wait) [ var(job) ... ])(
Wait for the specified jobs or processes.  If var(job) is not given
then all currently active child processes are waited for.
Each var(job) can be either a job specification or the process ID
of a job in the job table.
The exit status from this command is that of the job waited for.
If var(job) represents an unknown job or process ID, a warning is printed
(unless the tt(POSIX_BUILTINS) option is set) and the exit status is 127.

It is possible to wait for recent processes (specified by process ID,
not by job) that were running in the background even if the process has
exited.  Typically the process ID will be recorded by capturing the
value of the variable tt($!) immediately after the process has been
started.  There is a limit on the number of process IDs remembered by
the shell; this is given by the value of the system configuration
parameter tt(CHILD_MAX).  When this limit is reached, older process IDs
are discarded, least recently started processes first.

Note there is no protection against the process ID wrapping, i.e. if the
wait is not executed soon enough there is a chance the process waited
for is the wrong one.  A conflict implies both process IDs have been
generated by the shell, as other processes are not recorded, and that
the user is potentially interested in both, so this problem is intrinsic
to process IDs.

item(tt(zcompile -t) var(file) [ var(name) ... ])(
This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts,
storing the compiled form in a file, and to examine files containing
the compiled form.  This allows faster autoloading of functions and
sourcing of scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files
are read.

The first form (without the tt(-c), tt(-a) or tt(-t) options) creates a
compiled file.  If only the var(file) argument is given, the
output file has the name `var(file)tt(.zwc)' and will be placed in
the same directory as the var(file).  The shell will load the compiled
file instead of the normal function file when the function
is autoloaded; see
ifzman(\
the section `Autoloading Functions' in zmanref(zshmisc)
)\
ifnzman(\
noderef(Functions)
)\
for a description of how autoloaded functions are searched.  The
extension tt(.zwc) stands for `zsh word code'.

vindex(fpath, with zcompile)
If there is at least one var(name) argument, all the named files
are compiled into the output var(file) given as the first argument.  If
var(file) does not end in tt(.zwc), this extension is automatically
appended.  Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest'
files, and are intended to be used as elements of the tt(FPATH)/tt(fpath)
special array.

The second form, with the tt(-c) or tt(-a) options, writes the compiled
definitions for all the named functions into var(file).  For tt(-c), the
names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not those marked
for autoloading.  Undefined functions that are marked for autoloading
may be written by using the tt(-a) option, in which case the tt(fpath)
is searched and the contents of the definition files for those
functions, if found, are compiled into var(file).  If both tt(-c) and
tt(-a) are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked
for autoloading may be given.  In either case, the functions in files
written with the tt(-c) or tt(-a) option will be autoloaded as if the
tt(KSH_AUTOLOAD) option were unset.

The reason for handling loaded and not-yet-loaded functions with
different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the
file, and, at the end, call that function.  In such cases the output of
`tt(zcompile -c)' does not include the additional functions defined in
the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost.  Using
`tt(zcompile -a)' captures all this extra information.

If the tt(-m) option is combined with tt(-c) or tt(-a),
the var(name)s are used as patterns and all functions whose names
match one of these patterns will be written. If no var(name) is given,
the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written.

Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that
include redirections as part of the definition rather than within
the body of the function; for example

example(fn1() { { ... } >~/logfile })

can be compiled but

example(fn1() { ... } >~/logfile)

cannot.  It is possible to use the first form of tt(zcompile) to compile
autoloadable functions that include the full function definition instead
of just the body of the function.

The third form, with the tt(-t) option, examines an existing
compiled file.  Without further arguments, the names of the original
files compiled into it are listed.  The first line of output shows
the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file
will be used (i.e. by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory).
With arguments, nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if
definitions for em(all) var(name)s were found in the compiled
file, and non-zero if the definition for at least one var(name) was not
found.

Other options:

startitem()
item(tt(-U))(
Aliases are not expanded when compiling the var(name)d files.
)
item(tt(-R))(
When the compiled file is read, its contents are copied into the
shell's memory, rather than memory-mapped (see tt(-M)).  This
happens automatically on systems that do not support memory mapping.

When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is
often desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the
code to define functions which have already been defined, will
remain mapped, consequently wasting memory.
)
item(tt(-M))(
The compiled file is mapped into the shell's memory when read. This
is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running
on the same host will share this mapped file.  If neither tt(-R) nor
tt(-M) is given, the tt(zcompile) builtin decides what to do based
on the size of the compiled file.
)
xitem(tt(-k))
item(tt(-z))(
These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which
are to be autoloaded. If tt(-z) is given, the
function will be autoloaded as if the tt(KSH_AUTOLOAD) option is
em(not) set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is
read, while if the tt(-k) is given, the function will be loaded as if
tt(KSH_AUTOLOAD) em(is) set.  These options also take precedence over
any tt(-k) or tt(-z) options specified to the tt(autoload) builtin. If
neither of these options is given, the function will be loaded as
determined by the setting of the tt(KSH_AUTOLOAD) option at the time
the compiled file is read.
ifzman( )
These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed
var(name)s to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to
the next tt(-k) or tt(-z).
)
ifnzman(enditem()
)
The created file always contains two versions of the compiled
format, one for big-endian machines and one for small-endian
machines.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine
independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file
is actually used (and mapped).

Performs operations relating to zsh's loadable modules.
Loading of modules while the shell is running (`dynamical loading') is not
available on all operating systems, or on all installations on a particular
operating system, although the tt(zmodload) command itself is always
available and can be used to manipulate modules built into versions of the
shell executable without dynamical loading.

Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are
printed.  The tt(-L) option causes this list to be in the form of a
series of tt(zmodload) commands.  Forms with arguments are:

startitem()
xitem(tt(zmodload) [ tt(-is) ] var(name) ... )
item(tt(zmodload) tt(-u) [ tt(-i) ] var(name) ...)(
In the simplest case, tt(zmodload) loads a binary module.  The module must
be in a file with a name consisting of the specified var(name) followed by
a standard suffix, usually `tt(.so)' (`tt(.sl)' on HPUX).
If the module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module is
ignored.  If tt(zmodload) detects an inconsistency, such as an
invalid module name or circular dependency list, the current code block is 
aborted.  If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if it
is not available, non-zero status is silently returned.  The option
tt(-i) is accepted for compatibility but has no effect.

The var(name)d module is searched for in the same way a command is, using
tt($module_path) instead of tt($path).  However, the path search is
performed even when the module name contains a `tt(/)', which it usually does.
There is no way to prevent the path search.

If the module supports features (see below), tt(zmodload) tries to
enable all features when loading a module.  If the module was successfully
loaded but not all features could be enabled, tt(zmodload) returns status 2.

If the option tt(-s) is given, no error is printed if the module was not
available (though other errors indicating a problem with the module are
printed).  The return status indicates if the module was loaded.  This
is appropriate if the caller considers the module optional.

With tt(-u), tt(zmodload) unloads modules.  The same var(name)
must be given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is not
necessary for the module to exist in the file system.
The tt(-i) option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded).

Each module has a boot and a cleanup function.  The module
will not be loaded if its boot function fails.  Similarly a module
can only be unloaded if its cleanup function runs successfully.
)
item(tt(zmodload -F) [ tt(-almLe) tt(-P) var(param) ] var(module) [ [tt(PLUS()-)]var(feature) ... ])(
tt(zmodload -F) allows more selective control over the features provided
by modules.  With no options apart from tt(-F), the module named
var(module) is loaded, if it was not already loaded, and the list of
var(feature)s is set to the required state.  If no 
var(feature)s are specified, the module is loaded, if it was not already
loaded, but the state of features is unchanged.  Each feature
may be preceded by a tt(PLUS()) to turn the feature on, or tt(-) to turn it
off; the tt(PLUS()) is assumed if neither character is present.
Any feature not explicitly mentioned is left in its current state;
if the module was not previously loaded this means any such features will
remain disabled.  The return status is zero if all features were
set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features could
not be set (for example, a parameter couldn't be added because there
was a different parameter of the same name) but the module was loaded.

The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and math
functions; these are indicated by the prefix `tt(b:)', `tt(c:)'
(`tt(C:)' for an infix condition), `tt(p:)' and `tt(f:)', respectively,
followed by the name that the corresponding feature would have in the
shell.  For example, `tt(b:strftime)' indicates a builtin named
tt(strftime) and tt(p:EPOCHSECONDS) indicates a parameter named
tt(EPOCHSECONDS).  The module may provide other (`abstract') features of
its own as indicated by its documentation; these have no prefix.

With tt(-l) or tt(-L), features provided by the module are listed.  With
tt(-l) alone, a list of features together with their states is shown, one
feature per line.  With tt(-L) alone, a tt(zmodload -F) command that would
cause enabled features of the module to be turned on is shown.  With
tt(-lL), a tt(zmodload -F) command that would cause all the features to be
set to their current state is shown.  If one of these combinations is given
with the option tt(-P) var(param) then the parameter var(param) is set to an
array of features, either features together with their state or (if
tt(-L) alone is given) enabled features.

With the option tt(-L) the module name may be omitted; then a list
of all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed
in the form of tt(zmodload -F) commands.  If tt(-l) is also given,
the state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form.

A set of features may be provided together with tt(-l) or tt(-L) and a
module name; in that case only the state of those features is
considered.  Each feature may be preceded by tt(PLUS()) or tt(-) but the
character has no effect.  If no set of features is provided, all
features are considered.

With tt(-e), the command first tests that the module is loaded;
if it is not, status 1 is returned.  If the module is loaded,
the list of features given as an argument is examined.  Any feature
given with no prefix is simply tested to see if the module provides it;
any feature given with a prefix tt(PLUS()) or tt(-) is tested to
see if is provided and in the given state.  If the tests on all features
in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1.

With tt(-m), each entry in the given list of features is taken
as a pattern to be matched against the list of features provided
by the module.  An initial tt(PLUS()) or tt(-) must be given explicitly.
This may not be combined with the tt(-a) option as autoloads must
be specified explicitly.

With tt(-a), the given list of features is marked for autoload from
the specified module, which may not yet be loaded.  An optional tt(PLUS())
may appear before the feature name.  If the feature is prefixed with
tt(-), any existing autoload is removed.  The options tt(-l) and tt(-L)
may be used to list autoloads.  Autoloading is specific to individual
features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled.  Autoload requests are preserved if the module is
subsequently unloaded until an explicit `tt(zmodload -Fa) var(module)
tt(-)var(feature)' is issued.  It is not an error to request an autoload
for a feature of a module that is already loaded.

When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the features
actually provided by the module; if the feature is not provided the
autoload request is deleted.  A warning message is output; if the
module is being loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload
is successful, there is no effect on the status of the current command.
If the module is already loaded at the time when tt(zmodload -Fa) is
run, an error message is printed and status 1 returned.

tt(zmodload -Fa) can be used with the tt(-l), tt(-L), tt(-e) and
tt(-P) options for listing and testing the existence of autoloadable
features.  In this case tt(-l) is ignored if tt(-L) is specified.
tt(zmodload -FaL) with no module name lists autoloads for all modules.

Note that only standard features as described above can be autoloaded;
other features require the module to be loaded before enabling.

var(builtin)s.  When any of those builtins is called, the module specified
in the first argument is loaded and all its features are enabled (for
selective control of features use `tt(zmodload -F -a)' as described
above).  If only the var(name) is given, one builtin is defined, with
the same name as the module.  tt(-i) suppresses the error if the builtin
is already defined or autoloaded, but not if another builtin of the
same name is already defined.

With tt(-ab) and no arguments, all autoloaded builtins are listed, with the
module name (if different) shown in parentheses after the builtin name.

previously defined with tt(-ab).  This is only possible if the builtin is
not yet loaded.  tt(-i) suppresses the error if the builtin is already

the return status is set to zero if all var(string)s given as arguments
are names of loaded modules and to one if at least on var(string) is not
the name of a loaded module.  This can be used to test for the
availability of things implemented by modules.  In this case, any
aliases are automatically resolved and the tt(-A) flag is not used.
)
item(tt(zmodload) tt(-A) [ tt(-L) ] [ var(modalias)[tt(=)var(module)] ... ])(
For each argument, if both var(modalias) and var(module) are given,
define var(modalias) to be an alias for the module var(module).
If the module var(modalias) is ever subsequently requested, either via a
call to tt(zmodload) or implicitly, the shell will attempt to load
var(module) instead.  If var(module) is not given, show the definition of
var(modalias).  If no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases.
When listing, if the tt(-L) flag was also given, list the definition as a
tt(zmodload) command to recreate the alias.

The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether
the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists,
loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same
effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by
tt(zmodload -R) or by redefining the alias.  Chains of aliases (i.e. where
the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are
not circular.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they
may include path separators:  in this case, there is no requirement for any
part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first.  For
example, `tt(any/old/alias)' is always a valid alias.

Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved
module; these remain if the alias is removed.  It is valid to create an
alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to
a different module.  However, if a module has dependencies, it
will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will
already be marked as a loadable module in its own right.

Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the tt(zmodload) command
anywhere module names are required.  However, aliases will not be
shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `tt(zmodload)'.

Note that tt(zsh) makes no distinction between modules that were linked

this builtin command has to be used to make available the builtins and
