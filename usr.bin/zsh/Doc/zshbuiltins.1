.SH "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS"

Some shell builtin commands take options as described in individual
entries; these are often referred to in the list below as `\fBflags\fP\&' to
avoid confusion with shell options, which may also have an effect on the
behaviour of builtin commands\&.  In this introductory section,
`\fBoption\fP\&' always has the meaning of an option to a command that should
be familiar to most command line users\&.
.PP
Typically, options are single letters preceded by a hyphen (\fB\-\fP)\&.
Options that take an argument accept it either immediately following the
option letter or after white space, for example `\fBprint \-C3 {1\&.\&.9}\fP\&' or
`\fBprint \-C 3 {1\&.\&.9}\fP\&' are equivalent\&.  Arguments to options are not the
same as arguments to the command; the documentation indicates which is
which\&.  Options that do not take an argument may be combined in a single
word, for example `\fBprint \-rca \-\- *\fP\&' and `\fBprint \-r \-c \-a \-\- *\fP' are
equivalent\&.
.PP
Some shell builtin commands also take options that begin with `\fB+\fP\&'
instead of `\fB\-\fP\&'\&.  The list below makes clear which commands these
are\&.
.PP
Options (together with their individual arguments, if any) must appear
in a group before any non\-option arguments; once the first non\-option
argument has been found, option processing is terminated\&.
.PP
All builtin commands other than `\fBecho\fP\&' and precommand modifiers,
even those that have no options, can be given the argument `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&'
to terminate option processing\&.  This indicates that the following words
are non\-option arguments, but is otherwise ignored\&.  This is useful in
cases where arguments to the command may begin with `\fB\-\fP\&'\&.  For
historical reasons, most builtin commands (including `\fBecho\fP\&') also
recognize a single `\fB\-\fP\&' in a separate word for this purpose; note
that this is less standard and use of `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP\&' is recommended\&.

.TP
\fB\&.\fP \fIfile\fP [ \fIarg\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
Read commands from \fIfile\fP and execute them in the current shell
environment\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIfile\fP does not contain a slash, or if \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is set,
the shell looks in the components of \fB$path\fP to find the directory
containing \fIfile\fP\&.  Files in the current directory are not read
unless `\fB\&.\fP\&' appears somewhere in \fB$path\fP\&.  If a file named
`\fIfile\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP\&' is found, is newer than \fIfile\fP, and is the
compiled form (created with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin) of \fIfile\fP,
then commands are read from that file instead of \fIfile\fP\&.
.PP
If any arguments \fIarg\fP are given,
they become the positional parameters; the old positional
parameters are restored when the \fIfile\fP is done executing\&.
However, if no arguments are given,
the positional parameters remain those of the calling context,
and no restoring is done\&.
.PP
If \fIfile\fP was not found the return status is 127; if \fIfile\fP was found
but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return
status is the exit status of the last command executed\&.

\fBalias\fP [ {\fB+\fP|\fB\-\fP}\fBgmrsL\fP ] [ \fIname\fP[\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP] \&.\&.\&. ]
For each \fIname\fP with a corresponding \fIvalue\fP, define an alias
with that value\&.  A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP causes the next word
to be checked for alias expansion\&.  If the \fB\-g\fP flag is present,
define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not
occur in command position:
.RS
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB% perldoc \-\-help 2>&1 | grep \&'built\-in functions'
    \-f   Search Perl built\-in functions
% alias \-g HG=\&'\-\-help 2>&1 | grep'
% perldoc HG \&'built\-in functions'
    \-f   Search Perl built\-in functions\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
If the \fB\-s\fP flag is present, define a suffix alias: if the command
word on a command line is in the form `\fItext\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIname\fP\&', where
\fItext\fP is any non\-empty string, it is replaced by the text
`\fIvalue\fP \fItext\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIname\fP\&'\&.  Note that \fIname\fP is treated as
a literal string, not a pattern\&.  A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP is not
special in this case\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias \-s ps=\&'gv \-\-'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
will cause the command `\fB*\&.ps\fP\&' to be expanded to `\fBgv \-\- *\&.ps\fP'\&.  As
alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `\fB*\&.ps\fP\&' will
then be expanded\&.  Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from
other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
to create an alias for the command \fBps\fP) and the two sets are never
listed together\&.
.PP
For each \fIname\fP with no \fIvalue\fP,
print the value of \fIname\fP, if any\&.  With no arguments, print all
currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases\&.  If the \fB\-m\fP flag
is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases
matching these patterns are printed\&.  When printing aliases and one of
the \fB\-g\fP, \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-s\fP flags is present, restrict the printing to
global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one
which is neither a global nor a suffix alias\&.   Using `\fB+\fP\&'
instead of `\fB\-\fP\&', or ending the option list with a single
`\fB+\fP\&', prevents the values of the aliases from being printed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-L\fP flag is present, then print each
alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script\&.  The exit
status is nonzero if a \fIname\fP (with no \fIvalue\fP) is given for
which no alias has been defined\&.
.PP

\fBautoload\fP [ {\fB+\fP|\fB\-\fP}\fBRTUXdkmrtWz\fP ] [ \fB\-w\fP ] [ \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
See the section `Autoloading Functions\&' in \fIzshmisc\fP(1) for full details\&.  The \fBfpath\fP parameter
will be searched to find the function definition when the function is
first referenced\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIname\fP consists of an absolute path, the function is defined to
load from the file given (searching as usual for dump files in the given
location)\&.  The name of the function is the basename (non\-directory
part) of the file\&.  It is normally an error if the function is not found
in the given location; however, if the option \fB\-d\fP is given, searching
for the function defaults to \fB$fpath\fP\&.  If a function is loaded by
absolute path, any functions loaded from it that are marked for
\fBautoload\fP without an absolute path have the load path of the parent
function temporarily prepended to \fB$fpath\fP\&.
.PP
If the option \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-R\fP is given, the function is searched for
immediately and the location is recorded internally for use when the
function is executed; a relative path is expanded using the value of
\fB$PWD\fP\&.  This protects against a change to \fB$fpath\fP after the call
to \fBautoload\fP\&.  With \fB\-r\fP, if the function is not found, it is
silently left unresolved until execution; with \fB\-R\fP, an error message
is printed and command processing aborted immediately the search fails,
i\&.e\&. at the \fBautoload\fP command rather than at function execution\&.\&.
.PP
The flag \fB\-X\fP may be used only inside a shell function\&.  It causes the
calling function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately
loaded and executed, with the current array of positional parameters as
arguments\&.  This replaces the previous definition of the function\&.  If
no function definition is found, an error is printed and the function
remains undefined and marked for autoloading\&.  If an argument is given,
it is used as a directory (i\&.e\&. it does not include the name of the
function) in which the function is to be found; this may be combined
with the \fB\-d\fP option to allow the function search to default to \fB$fpath\fP
if it is not in the given location\&.
.PP
The flag \fB+X\fP attempts to load each \fIname\fP as an autoloaded function,
but does \fInot\fP execute it\&.  The exit status is zero (success) if the
function was not previously defined \fIand\fP a definition for it was found\&.
This does \fInot\fP replace any existing definition of the function\&.  The
exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found\&.  In the latter case the function remains
undefined and marked for autoloading\&.  If ksh\-style autoloading is
enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file
plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal
ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function\&.
If the \fB\-m\fP flag is also given each \fIname\fP is treated as a
pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match the
pattern are loaded\&.
.PP
With the \fB\-t\fP flag, turn on execution tracing; with \fB\-T\fP, turn on
execution tracing only for the current function, turning it off on entry
to any called functions that do not also have tracing enabled\&.
.PP
With the \fB\-U\fP flag, alias expansion is suppressed when the function is
loaded\&.
.PP
With the \fB\-w\fP flag, the \fIname\fPs are taken as names of files compiled
with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin, and all functions defined in them are
marked for autoloading\&.
.PP
The flags \fB\-z\fP and \fB\-k\fP mark the function to be autoloaded using the
zsh or ksh style, as if the option \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP were unset or were
set, respectively\&.  The flags override the setting of the option at the
time the function is loaded\&.
.PP
Note that the \fBautoload\fP command makes no attempt to ensure the
shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have
any particular value\&.  For this, the \fBemulate\fP command can be used:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBemulate zsh \-c \&'autoload \-Uz \fIfunc\fP'\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
arranges that when \fIfunc\fP is loaded the shell is in native \fBzsh\fP
emulation, and this emulation is also applied when \fIfunc\fP is run\&.
.PP
Some of the functions of \fBautoload\fP are also provided by \fBfunctions
\-u\fP or \fBfunctions \-U\fP, but \fBautoload\fP is a more comprehensive
interface\&.

Change the current directory\&.  In the first form, change the
current directory to \fIarg\fP, or to the value of \fB$HOME\fP if
\fIarg\fP is not specified\&.  If \fIarg\fP is `\fB\-\fP\&', change to the
previous directory\&.
.RS
.PP
Otherwise, if \fIarg\fP begins with a slash, attempt to change to the
directory given by \fIarg\fP\&.
.PP
If \fIarg\fP does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether
the current directory `\fB\&.\fP\&' occurs in the list of directories contained
in the shell parameter \fBcdpath\fP\&.  If it does not, first attempt to change
to the directory \fIarg\fP under the current directory, and if that fails
but \fBcdpath\fP is set and contains at least one element attempt to change
to the directory \fIarg\fP under each component of \fBcdpath\fP in turn until
successful\&.  If `\fB\&.\fP\&' occurs in \fBcdpath\fP, then \fBcdpath\fP is searched
strictly in order so that `\fB\&.\fP\&' is only tried at the appropriate point\&.
.PP
The order of testing \fBcdpath\fP is modified if the option \fBPOSIX_CD\fP
is set, as described in the documentation for the option\&.
.PP
If no directory is found, the option \fBCDABLE_VARS\fP is set, and a
parameter named \fIarg\fP exists whose value begins with a slash, treat its
value as the directory\&.  In that case, the parameter is added to the named
directory hash table\&.
.PP
The second form of \fBcd\fP substitutes the string \fInew\fP
for the string \fIold\fP in the name of the current directory,
and tries to change to this new directory\&.
.PP
The third form of \fBcd\fP extracts an entry from the directory
stack, and changes to that directory\&.  An argument of the form
`\fB+\fP\fIn\fP\&' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left
of the list shown by the \fBdirs\fP command, starting with zero\&.
An argument of the form `\fB\-\fP\fIn\fP\&' counts from the right\&.
If the \fBPUSHD_MINUS\fP option is set, the meanings of `\fB+\fP\&'
and `\fB\-\fP\&' in this context are swapped\&.
If the \fBPOSIX_CD\fP option is set, this form of \fBcd\fP is not recognised
and will be interpreted as the first form\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-q\fP (quiet) option is specified, the hook function \fBchpwd\fP
and the functions in the array \fBchpwd_functions\fP are not called\&.
This is useful for calls to \fBcd\fP that do not change the environment
seen by an interactive user\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-s\fP option is specified, \fBcd\fP refuses to change the current
directory if the given pathname contains symlinks\&.  If the \fB\-P\fP option
is given or the \fBCHASE_LINKS\fP option is set, symbolic links are resolved
to their true values\&.  If the \fB\-L\fP option is given symbolic links are
retained in the directory (and not resolved) regardless of the state of
the \fBCHASE_LINKS\fP option\&.

of them are suppressed\&. The \fB\-p\fP flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in \fB$path\fP\&. With the \fB\-v\fP flag, \fBcommand\fP

\fBdisable\fP [ \fB\-afmprs\fP ] \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&.
Temporarily disable the \fIname\fPd hash table elements or patterns\&.  The default
is to disable builtin commands\&.  This allows you to use an external
command with the same name as a builtin command\&.  The \fB\-a\fP option
causes \fBdisable\fP to act on regular or global aliases\&.  The \fB\-s\fP
option causes \fBdisable\fP to act on suffix aliases\&.  The \fB\-f\fP option causes
\fBdisable\fP to act on shell functions\&.  The \fB\-r\fP options causes
\fBdisable\fP to act on reserved words\&.  Without arguments all disabled
hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are printed\&.
With the \fB\-m\fP flag the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be
quoted to prevent them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash
table elements from the corresponding hash table matching these patterns
are disabled\&.  Disabled objects can be enabled with the \fBenable\fP
command\&.
.RS
.PP
With the option \fB\-p\fP, \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. refer to elements of the

Note that patterns
not allowed by the current settings for the options \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP,

not been issued\&.  The list below indicates any option settings

setting \fBSH_GLOB\fP has a wider effect than merely disabling patterns

If the \fBemulate\fP command occurs inside a function that has been
marked for execution tracing with \fBfunctions \-t\fP then the \fBxtrace\fP
option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other options\&.
Note that code executed inside the function by the \fB\&.\fP, \fBsource\fP, or
\fBeval\fP commands is not considered to be running directly from the
function, hence does not provoke this behaviour\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-R\fP switch is given, all settable options
are reset to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause portability
problems in scripts and functions are altered\&.  If the \fB\-L\fP switch is given,
the options \fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP, \fBLOCAL_PATTERNS\fP and \fBLOCAL_TRAPS\fP
will be set as
well, causing the effects of the \fBemulate\fP command and any \fBsetopt\fP,
\fBdisable \-p\fP or \fBenable \-p\fP, and \fBtrap\fP commands to be local to
the immediately surrounding shell
function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation
modes except \fBksh\fP\&. The \fB\-L\fP switch is mutually exclusive with the
use of \fB\-c\fP in \fIflags\fP\&.
.PP
If there is a single argument and the \fB\-l\fP switch is given, the
options that would be set or unset (the latter indicated with the prefix
`\fBno\fP\&') are listed\&.  \fB\-l\fP can be combined with \fB\-L\fP or \fB\-R\fP and
the list will be modified in the appropriate way\&.  Note the list does
not depend on the current setting of options, i\&.e\&. it includes all
options that may in principle change, not just those that would actually
change\&.
.PP
The \fIflags\fP may be any of the invocation\-time flags described in
the section INVOCATION in \fIzsh\fP(1),
except that `\fB\-o EMACS\fP\&' and `\fB\-o VI\fP' may not be used\&.  Flags such
as `\fB+r\fP\&'/`\fB+o RESTRICTED\fP' may be prohibited in some circumstances\&.
.PP
If \fB\-c\fP \fIarg\fP appears in \fIflags\fP, \fIarg\fP is evaluated while the
requested emulation is temporarily in effect\&.  In this case the emulation
mode and all options are restored to their previous values before
\fBemulate\fP returns\&.  The \fB\-R\fP switch may precede the name of the shell
to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including \fB\-R\fP in
\fIflags\fP\&.
.PP
Use of \fB\-c\fP enables `sticky\&' emulation mode for functions defined
within the evaluated expression:  the emulation mode is associated
thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed
the emulation (respecting the \fB\-R\fP switch, if present) and all
options are set (and pattern disables cleared)
before entry to the function, and the state is restored after exit\&.
If the function is called when the sticky emulation is already in
effect, either within an `\fBemulate\fP \fIshell\fP \fB\-c\fP\&' expression or
within another function with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit
from the function do not cause options to be altered (except due to
standard processing such as the \fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP option)\&.  This also
applies to functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation;
the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point the
function is loaded as well as when it is run\&.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBemulate sh \-c \&'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }
fno() { fni; }\&'
fno\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The two functions \fBfni\fP and \fBfno\fP are defined with sticky \fBsh\fP
emulation\&.  \fBfno\fP is then executed, causing options associated
with emulations to be set to their values in \fBsh\fP\&.  \fBfno\fP then
calls \fBfni\fP; because \fBfni\fP is also marked for sticky \fBsh\fP
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit from it\&.
Hence the option \fBcshnullglob\fP, turned off by \fBsh\fP emulation, will
be turned on within \fBfni\fP and remain on return to \fBfno\fP\&.  On exit
from \fBfno\fP, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the
state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation\&.
.PP
The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended
purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable
environment\&.  More detailed rules follow\&.
.PD 0
.TP
1\&.
The sticky emulation environment provided by `\fBemulate\fP
\fIshell\fP \fB\-c\fP\&' is identical to that provided by entry to
a function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being
defined in such an environment\&.  Hence, for example, the sticky
emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined within functions
with sticky emulation\&.
.TP
2\&.
No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from
functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other than those
that would normally take place, even if those functions are called
within sticky emulation\&.
.TP
3\&.
No special handling is provided for functions marked for
\fBautoload\fP nor for functions present in wordcode created by
the \fBzcompile\fP command\&.
.TP
4\&.
The presence or absence of the \fB\-R\fP switch to \fBemulate\fP
corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for example
`\fBemulate sh \-c\fP\&', `\fBemulate \-R sh \-c\fP' and `\fBemulate csh \-c\fP'
are treated as three distinct sticky emulations\&.
.TP
5\&.
Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the
basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are different, so for
example `\fBemulate zsh \-c\fP\&' and `\fBemulate zsh \-o cbases \-c\fP' are
treated as distinct sticky emulations\&.

restoration can conflict with making these variables "local", so your best
bet is to avoid local declarations for these variables in functions that use
`\fBfc \-p\fP\&'\&.  The one other guaranteed\-safe combination is declaring these
variables to be local at the top of your function and using the automatic

pop a push marked for automatic popping if you need to do so before the

\fBhash\fP [ \fB\-Ldfmrv\fP ] [ \fIname\fP[\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP] ] \&.\&.\&.
\fBhash\fP can be used to directly modify the contents of the command
hash table, and the named directory hash table\&.  Normally one would
modify these tables by modifying one\&'s \fBPATH\fP
(for the command hash table) or by creating appropriate shell parameters
(for the named directory hash table)\&.
The choice of hash table to work on is determined by the \fB\-d\fP option;
without the option the command hash table is used, and with the option the
named directory hash table is used\&.

A command \fIname\fP starting with a \fB/\fP is never hashed, whether by
explicit use of the \fBhash\fP command or otherwise\&.  Such a command
is always found by direct look up in the file system\&.

Given no arguments, and neither the \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-f\fP options,
the selected hash table will be listed in full\&.
.PP
The \fB\-r\fP option causes the selected hash table to be emptied\&.
It will be subsequently rebuilt in the normal fashion\&.
The \fB\-f\fP option causes the selected hash table to be fully
rebuilt immediately\&.  For the command hash table this hashes
all the absolute directories in the \fBPATH\fP,
and for the named directory hash table this adds all users\&' home directories\&.
These two options cannot be used with any arguments\&.
.PP
The \fB\-m\fP option causes the arguments to be taken as patterns
(which should be quoted) and the elements of the hash table
matching those patterns are printed\&.  This is the only way to display
a limited selection of hash table elements\&.
.PP
For each \fIname\fP with a corresponding \fIvalue\fP, put `\fIname\fP\&' in
the selected hash table, associating it with the pathname `\fIvalue\fP\&'\&.
In the command hash table, this means that
whenever `\fIname\fP\&' is used as a command argument, the shell will try
to execute the file given by `\fIvalue\fP\&'\&.
In the named directory hash table, this means
that `\fIvalue\fP\&' may be referred to as `\fB~\fP\fIname\fP'\&.

specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character,
the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to
print; otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression\&. See

Test if input is available before attempting to read\&.  If \fInum\fP

in this case the read times out if input is not available within this

\fBread\fP returns immediately if no input is available\&.
If no input is available, return status 1 and do not set any variables\&.
 
This option is not available when reading from the editor buffer with
\fB\-z\fP, when called from within completion with \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-l\fP, with
\fB\-q\fP which clears the input queue before reading, or within zle where
other mechanisms should be used to test for input\&.
 
Note that read does not attempt to alter the input processing mode\&.  The
default mode is canonical input, in which an entire line is read at a time,
so usually `\fBread \-t\fP\&' will not read anything until an entire line has
been typed\&.  However, when reading from the terminal with \fB\-k\fP
input is processed one key at a time; in this case, only availability of
the first character is tested, so that e\&.g\&. `\fBread \-t \-k 2\fP\&' can still
block on the second character\&.  Use two instances of `\fBread \-t \-k\fP\&' if
this is not what is wanted\&.

The main differences between the conditional expression syntax and the
\fBtest\fP and \fB[\fP builtins are:  these commands are not handled
syntactically, so for example an empty variable expansion may cause an
argument to be omitted; syntax errors cause status 2 to be returned instead
of a shell error; and arithmetic operators expect integer arguments rather

The command attempts to implement POSIX and its extensions where these

\fBZSH_DEBUG_CMD\fP is set to the string corresponding to the command

Except as noted below for control flags that change the behavior,

Nothing is printed for newly\-created parameters, or when any attribute
flags listed below are given along with the \fIname\fP\&.  Using
`\fB+\fP\&' instead of minus to introduce an attribute turns it off\&.
.PP
If no \fIname\fP is present, the names and values of all parameters are
printed\&.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only
those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `\fB+\fP\&'
rather than `\fB\-\fP\&' to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values
of parameters when there is no parameter name\&.
.PP
All forms of the command handle scalar assignment\&.  Array assignment is
possible if any of the reserved words \fBdeclare\fP, \fBexport\fP, \fBfloat\fP,
\fBinteger\fP, \fBlocal\fP, \fBreadonly\fP or \fBtypeset\fP is matched when the
line is parsed (N\&.B\&. not when it is executed)\&.  In this case the arguments

Examples of the differences between command and reserved word parsing:
.PP
.RS

On the other hand:
.PP

.nf
\fB# Normal builtin interface

.fi
.RE
.PP
The \fBbuiltin\fP keyword causes the above to use the standard builtin
interface to \fBtypeset\fP in which argument parsing is performed in the same
way as for other commands\&.  This example creates a scalar \fBsvar\fP
containing the value \fBtwo\fP and another scalar parameter \fBwords\fP with
no value\&.  An array value in this case would either cause an error or be
treated as an obscure set of glob qualifiers\&.
.PP
Arbitrary arguments are allowed if they take the form of assignments
after command line expansion; however, these only perform scalar
assignment:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBvar=\&'svar=val'
typeset $var\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The above sets the scalar parameter \fBsvar\fP to the value \fBval\fP\&.
Parentheses around the value within \fBvar\fP would not cause array
assignment as they will be treated as ordinary characters when \fB$var\fP
is substituted\&.  Any non\-trivial expansion in the name part of the
assignment causes the argument to be treated in this fashion:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBtypeset {var1,var2,var3}=name\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The above syntax is valid, and has the expected effect of setting the
three parameters to the same value, but the command line is parsed as
a set of three normal command line arguments to \fBtypeset\fP after
expansion\&.  Hence it is not possible to assign to multiple arrays by
this means\&.
.PP
Note that each interface to any of the commands may be disabled
separately\&.  For example, `\fBdisable \-r typeset\fP\&' disables the reserved
word interface to \fBtypeset\fP, exposing the builtin interface, while
`\fBdisable typeset\fP\&' disables the builtin\&.  Note that disabling the
reserved word interface for \fBtypeset\fP may cause problems with the
output of `\fBtypeset \-p\fP\&', which assumes the reserved word interface is
available in order to restore array and associative array values\&.
.PP
Unlike parameter assignment statements, \fBtypeset\fP\&'s exit status on an
assignment that involves a command substitution does not reflect the exit
status of the command substitution\&.  Therefore, to test for an error in
a command substitution, separate the declaration of the parameter from its
initialization:
.PP
.RS
.nf

If no attribute flags are given, and either no \fIname\fP arguments are

and it is an error for any other options to follow `\fB+\fP\&'\&.  The
effect of `\fB+\fP\&' is as if all attribute flags which precede it were

equivalent to `\fBtypeset +U\fP\&' and displays the names of all arrays having
the uniqueness attribute, whereas `\fBtypeset \-f \-U +\fP\&' displays the
names of all autoloadable functions\&.  If \fB+\fP is the only option,

.TP
\fB\-g\fP
The \fB\-g\fP (global) means that any resulting parameter will not be
restricted to local scope\&.  Note that this does not necessarily mean that
the parameter will be global, as the flag will apply to any existing
parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing function\&.  This flag does not
affect the parameter after creation, hence it has no effect when listing
existing parameters, nor does the flag \fB+g\fP have any effect except in
combination with \fB\-m\fP (see below)\&.

If the \fB+g\fP flag is combined with \fB\-m\fP, a new local parameter is

Except when assignments are made with \fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP, using
\fB+m\fP forces the matching parameters and their attributes to be printed,

This flag has a different meaning when used with \fB\-f\fP; see below\&.
Otherwise the \fB\-T\fP option requires zero, two, or three arguments to be
present\&.  With no arguments, the list of parameters created in this
fashion is shown\&.  With two or three arguments, the first two are the name
of a scalar and of an array parameter (in that order) that will be tied
together in the manner of \fB$PATH\fP and \fB$path\fP\&.  The optional third
argument is a single\-character separator which will be used to join the
elements of the array to form the scalar; if absent, a colon is used, as
with \fB$PATH\fP\&.  Only the first character of the separator is significant;
any remaining characters are ignored\&.  Multibyte characters are not
yet supported\&.
.RS
.PP
Only one of the scalar and array parameters may be assigned an initial
value (the restrictions on assignment forms described above also apply)\&.
.PP
Both the scalar and the array may be manipulated as normal\&.  If one is
unset, the other will automatically be unset too\&.  There is no way of
untying the variables without unsetting them, nor of converting the type
of one of them with another \fBtypeset\fP command; \fB+T\fP does not work,
assigning an array to \fIscalar\fP is an error, and assigning a scalar to
\fIarray\fP sets it to be a single\-element array\&.
.PP
Note that both `\fBtypeset \-xT \&.\&.\&.\fP\&'  and `\fBexport \-T \&.\&.\&.\fP' work, but
only the scalar will be marked for export\&.  Setting the value using the
scalar version causes a split on all separators (which cannot be quoted)\&.
It is possible to apply \fB\-T\fP to two previously tied variables but with a
different separator character, in which case the variables remain joined
as before but the separator is changed\&.

When an existing scalar is tied to a new array, the value of the scalar
is preserved but no attribute other than export will be preserved\&.

\fB\-L\fP [ \fIn\fP ]
Left justify and remove leading blanks from the value when the parameter

If \fIn\fP is nonzero, it defines the width of the field\&.
If \fIn\fP is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
the first assignment\&.  In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the
complete value assigned to the parameter is used to determine the width,
not the value that would be output\&.

The width is the count of characters, which may be multibyte characters

Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible
for padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate

\fB\-a\fP
The names refer to array parameters\&.  An array parameter may be
created this way, but it may be assigned to in the \fBtypeset\fP

arrays are shown\&.

The names refer to functions rather than parameters\&.  No assignments
can be made, and the only other valid flags are \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-k\fP,
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP\&.  The flag \fB\-t\fP turns on execution tracing
for this function; the flag \fB\-T\fP does the same, but turns off tracing
for any named (not anonymous) function called from the present one,
unless that function also
has the \fB\-t\fP or \fB\-T\fP flag\&.  The \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-U\fP flags cause the
function to be marked for autoloading; \fB\-U\fP also causes alias
expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded\&.  See the
description of the `\fBautoload\fP\&' builtin for details\&.
.RS

Note that the builtin \fBfunctions\fP provides the same basic capabilities

\fB\-h\fP
Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `<S>\&' in the table in
\fIzshparam\fP(1)), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others\&.  A special parameter with this attribute will
not retain its special effect when made local\&.  Thus after `\fBtypeset \-h
PATH\fP\&', a function containing `\fBtypeset PATH\fP' will create an ordinary
local parameter without the usual behaviour of \fBPATH\fP\&.  Alternatively,
the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a
function `\fBtypeset \-h PATH\fP\&' creates an ordinary local parameter and the
special \fBPATH\fP parameter is not altered in any way\&.  It is also possible
to create a local parameter using `\fBtypeset +h \fP\fIspecial\fP\&', where the
local copy of \fIspecial\fP will retain its special properties regardless of
having the \fB\-h\fP attribute\&.  Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in \fBzsh/mapfile\fP and \fBzsh/parameter\fP) are
automatically given the \fB\-h\fP attribute to avoid name clashes\&.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Hide value: specifies that \fBtypeset\fP will not display the value of the
parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
always as if the `\fB+\fP\&' flag had been given\&.  Use of the parameter is
in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is
specified by name, or by pattern with the \fB\-m\fP option\&.  This is on by
default for the parameters in the \fBzsh/parameter\fP and \fBzsh/mapfile\fP

some of which like \fB\-U\fP or \fB\-Z\fP would affect the value\&. More generally,
the readonly attribute should not be relied on as a security mechanism\&.

Note that in zsh (like in pdksh but unlike most other shells) it is

It is possible to wait for recent processes (specified by process ID,

Note there is no protection against the process ID wrapping, i\&.e\&. if the
wait is not executed soon enough there is a chance the process waited

This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts,
storing the compiled form in a file, and to examine files containing
the compiled form\&.  This allows faster autoloading of functions and
sourcing of scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files
are read\&.
.RS
.PP
The first form (without the \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-t\fP options) creates a
compiled file\&.  If only the \fIfile\fP argument is given, the
output file has the name `\fIfile\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP\&' and will be placed in
the same directory as the \fIfile\fP\&.  The shell will load the compiled
file instead of the normal function file when the function
is autoloaded; see
the section `Autoloading Functions\&' in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)
for a description of how autoloaded functions are searched\&.  The
extension \fB\&.zwc\fP stands for `zsh word code\&'\&.
.PP
If there is at least one \fIname\fP argument, all the named files
are compiled into the output \fIfile\fP given as the first argument\&.  If
\fIfile\fP does not end in \fB\&.zwc\fP, this extension is automatically
appended\&.  Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest\&'
files, and are intended to be used as elements of the \fBFPATH\fP/\fBfpath\fP
special array\&.
.PP
The second form, with the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP options, writes the compiled
definitions for all the named functions into \fIfile\fP\&.  For \fB\-c\fP, the
names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not those marked
for autoloading\&.  Undefined functions that are marked for autoloading
may be written by using the \fB\-a\fP option, in which case the \fBfpath\fP
is searched and the contents of the definition files for those
functions, if found, are compiled into \fIfile\fP\&.  If both \fB\-c\fP and
\fB\-a\fP are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked
for autoloading may be given\&.  In either case, the functions in files
written with the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP option will be autoloaded as if the
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option were unset\&.
.PP
The reason for handling loaded and not\-yet\-loaded functions with
different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the
file, and, at the end, call that function\&.  In such cases the output of
`\fBzcompile \-c\fP\&' does not include the additional functions defined in
the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost\&.  Using
`\fBzcompile \-a\fP\&' captures all this extra information\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fP option is combined with \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP,
the \fIname\fPs are used as patterns and all functions whose names
match one of these patterns will be written\&. If no \fIname\fP is given,
the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written\&.

Note the second form cannot be used for compiling functions that
include redirections as part of the definition rather than within
the body of the function; for example

autoloadable functions that include the full function definition instead
of just the body of the function\&.
.PP
The third form, with the \fB\-t\fP option, examines an existing
compiled file\&.  Without further arguments, the names of the original
files compiled into it are listed\&.  The first line of output shows
the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file
will be used (i\&.e\&. by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory)\&.
With arguments, nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if
definitions for \fIall\fP \fIname\fPs were found in the compiled
file, and non\-zero if the definition for at least one \fIname\fP was not
found\&.

When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is
often desirable to use this option; otherwise the whole file, including the
code to define functions which have already been defined, will
remain mapped, consequently wasting memory\&.

\fB\-M\fP
The compiled file is mapped into the shell\&'s memory when read\&. This
is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running
on the same host will share this mapped file\&.  If neither \fB\-R\fP nor
\fB\-M\fP is given, the \fBzcompile\fP builtin decides what to do based
on the size of the compiled file\&.

\fB\-z\fP
These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which
are to be autoloaded\&. If \fB\-z\fP is given, the
function will be autoloaded as if the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option is
\fInot\fP set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is
read, while if the \fB\-k\fP is given, the function will be loaded as if
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP \fIis\fP set\&.  These options also take precedence over
any \fB\-k\fP or \fB\-z\fP options specified to the \fBautoload\fP builtin\&. If
neither of these options is given, the function will be loaded as
determined by the setting of the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option at the time
the compiled file is read\&.
 
These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed
\fIname\fPs to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to
the next \fB\-k\fP or \fB\-z\fP\&.

The created file always contains two versions of the compiled
format, one for big\-endian machines and one for small\-endian
machines\&.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine
independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file
is actually used (and mapped)\&.

Loading of modules while the shell is running (`dynamical loading\&') is not

Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are

In the simplest case, \fBzmodload\fP loads a binary module\&.  The module must
be in a file with a name consisting of the specified \fIname\fP followed by
a standard suffix, usually `\fB\&.so\fP\&' (`\fB\&.sl\fP' on HPUX)\&.
If the module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module is
ignored\&.  If \fBzmodload\fP detects an inconsistency, such as an
invalid module name or circular dependency list, the current code block is 
aborted\&.  If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if it
is not available, non\-zero status is silently returned\&.  The option
\fB\-i\fP is accepted for compatibility but has no effect\&.

The \fIname\fPd module is searched for in the same way a command is, using
\fB$module_path\fP instead of \fB$path\fP\&.  However, the path search is

There is no way to prevent the path search\&.
.PP
If the module supports features (see below), \fBzmodload\fP tries to
enable all features when loading a module\&.  If the module was successfully
loaded but not all features could be enabled, \fBzmodload\fP returns status 2\&.

If the option \fB\-s\fP is given, no error is printed if the module was not
available (though other errors indicating a problem with the module are
printed)\&.  The return status indicates if the module was loaded\&.  This
is appropriate if the caller considers the module optional\&.
.PP
With \fB\-u\fP, \fBzmodload\fP unloads modules\&.  The same \fIname\fP

necessary for the module to exist in the file system\&.
The \fB\-i\fP option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded)\&.

\fBzmodload \-F\fP [ \fB\-almLe\fP \fB\-P\fP \fIparam\fP ] \fImodule\fP [ [\fB+\-\fP]\fIfeature\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
\fBzmodload \-F\fP allows more selective control over the features provided
by modules\&.  With no options apart from \fB\-F\fP, the module named
\fImodule\fP is loaded, if it was not already loaded, and the list of
\fIfeature\fPs is set to the required state\&.  If no 
\fIfeature\fPs are specified, the module is loaded, if it was not already
loaded, but the state of features is unchanged\&.  Each feature
may be preceded by a \fB+\fP to turn the feature on, or \fB\-\fP to turn it
off; the \fB+\fP is assumed if neither character is present\&.
Any feature not explicitly mentioned is left in its current state;
if the module was not previously loaded this means any such features will
remain disabled\&.  The return status is zero if all features were
set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features could
not be set (for example, a parameter couldn\&'t be added because there
was a different parameter of the same name) but the module was loaded\&.
.RS
.PP
The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and math
functions; these are indicated by the prefix `\fBb:\fP\&', `\fBc:\fP'
(`\fBC:\fP\&' for an infix condition), `\fBp:\fP' and `\fBf:\fP', respectively,
followed by the name that the corresponding feature would have in the
shell\&.  For example, `\fBb:strftime\fP\&' indicates a builtin named
\fBstrftime\fP and \fBp:EPOCHSECONDS\fP indicates a parameter named
\fBEPOCHSECONDS\fP\&.  The module may provide other (`abstract\&') features of
its own as indicated by its documentation; these have no prefix\&.
.PP
With \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP, features provided by the module are listed\&.  With
\fB\-l\fP alone, a list of features together with their states is shown, one
feature per line\&.  With \fB\-L\fP alone, a \fBzmodload \-F\fP command that would
cause enabled features of the module to be turned on is shown\&.  With
\fB\-lL\fP, a \fBzmodload \-F\fP command that would cause all the features to be
set to their current state is shown\&.  If one of these combinations is given
with the option \fB\-P\fP \fIparam\fP then the parameter \fIparam\fP is set to an
array of features, either features together with their state or (if
\fB\-L\fP alone is given) enabled features\&.
.PP
With the option \fB\-L\fP the module name may be omitted; then a list
of all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed
in the form of \fBzmodload \-F\fP commands\&.  If \fB\-l\fP is also given,
the state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form\&.
.PP
A set of features may be provided together with \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP and a
module name; in that case only the state of those features is
considered\&.  Each feature may be preceded by \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP but the
character has no effect\&.  If no set of features is provided, all
features are considered\&.
.PP
With \fB\-e\fP, the command first tests that the module is loaded;
if it is not, status 1 is returned\&.  If the module is loaded,
the list of features given as an argument is examined\&.  Any feature
given with no prefix is simply tested to see if the module provides it;
any feature given with a prefix \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP is tested to
see if is provided and in the given state\&.  If the tests on all features
in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1\&.
.PP
With \fB\-m\fP, each entry in the given list of features is taken
as a pattern to be matched against the list of features provided
by the module\&.  An initial \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP must be given explicitly\&.
This may not be combined with the \fB\-a\fP option as autoloads must
be specified explicitly\&.
.PP
With \fB\-a\fP, the given list of features is marked for autoload from
the specified module, which may not yet be loaded\&.  An optional \fB+\fP
may appear before the feature name\&.  If the feature is prefixed with
\fB\-\fP, any existing autoload is removed\&.  The options \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP
may be used to list autoloads\&.  Autoloading is specific to individual
features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled\&.  Autoload requests are preserved if the module is
subsequently unloaded until an explicit `\fBzmodload \-Fa\fP \fImodule\fP
\fB\-\fP\fIfeature\fP\&' is issued\&.  It is not an error to request an autoload
for a feature of a module that is already loaded\&.
.PP
When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the features
actually provided by the module; if the feature is not provided the
autoload request is deleted\&.  A warning message is output; if the
module is being loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload
is successful, there is no effect on the status of the current command\&.
If the module is already loaded at the time when \fBzmodload \-Fa\fP is
run, an error message is printed and status 1 returned\&.
.PP
\fBzmodload \-Fa\fP can be used with the \fB\-l\fP, \fB\-L\fP, \fB\-e\fP and
\fB\-P\fP options for listing and testing the existence of autoloadable
features\&.  In this case \fB\-l\fP is ignored if \fB\-L\fP is specified\&.
\fBzmodload \-FaL\fP with no module name lists autoloads for all modules\&.

The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether
the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists,
loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same
effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by
\fBzmodload \-R\fP or by redefining the alias\&.  Chains of aliases (i\&.e\&. where
the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are
not circular\&.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they
may include path separators:  in this case, there is no requirement for any
part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first\&.  For
example, `\fBany/old/alias\fP\&' is always a valid alias\&.
.PP
Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved
module; these remain if the alias is removed\&.  It is valid to create an
alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to
a different module\&.  However, if a module has dependencies, it
will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will
already be marked as a loadable module in its own right\&.
.PP
Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the \fBzmodload\fP command
anywhere module names are required\&.  However, aliases will not be
shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `\fBzmodload\fP\&'\&.

Note that \fBzsh\fP makes no distinction between modules that were linked
