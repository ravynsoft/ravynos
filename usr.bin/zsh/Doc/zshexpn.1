zshexpn \- zsh expansion and substitution
.\" Yodl file: Zsh/expn.yo
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The following types of expansions are performed in the indicated order in
five steps:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fIHistory Expansion\fP
This is performed only in interactive shells\&.
.TP
\fIAlias Expansion\fP
Aliases are expanded immediately before the command line is parsed as
explained
under Aliasing in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.
.TP
.PD 0
\fIProcess Substitution\fP
.TP
.PD 0
\fIParameter Expansion\fP
.TP
.PD 0
\fICommand Substitution\fP
.TP
.PD 0
\fIArithmetic Expansion\fP
.TP
.PD
\fIBrace Expansion\fP
These five are performed in left\-to\-right fashion\&.  On each argument,
any of the five steps that are needed are performed one after the other\&.
Hence, for example, all the parts of parameter expansion are completed
before command substitution is started\&.  After these expansions, all
unquoted occurrences of the characters `\fB\e\fP\&',`\fB'\fP' and `\fB"\fP' are
removed\&.
.TP
\fIFilename Expansion\fP
If the \fBSH_FILE_EXPANSION\fP option is set, the order of expansion is
modified for compatibility with \fBsh\fP and \fBksh\fP\&.  In that case
\fIfilename expansion\fP is performed immediately after \fIalias expansion\fP,
preceding the set of five expansions mentioned above\&.
.TP
\fIFilename Generation\fP
This expansion, commonly referred to as \fBglobbing\fP, is always done last\&.
.PP
The following sections explain the types of expansion in detail\&.
.PP
.SH "HISTORY EXPANSION"
History expansion allows you to use words from previous command
lines in the command line you are typing\&.  This simplifies spelling
corrections and the repetition of complicated commands or arguments\&.
.PP
Immediately before execution, each command is saved in the history list,
the size of which is controlled by the \fBHISTSIZE\fP parameter\&.  The one
most recent command is always retained in any case\&.  Each saved command in
the history list is called a history \fIevent\fP and is assigned a number,
beginning with 1 (one) when the shell starts up\&.  The history number that
you may see in your prompt (see
EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)) is the number that is to be assigned to the \fInext\fP command\&.
.PP
.SS "Overview"
A history expansion begins with the first character of the \fBhistchars\fP
parameter, which is `\fB!\fP\&' by default, and may occur anywhere on the
command line, including inside double quotes (but not inside single quotes
\fB\&'\&.\&.\&.'\fP or C\-style quotes \fB$'\&.\&.\&.'\fP nor when escaped with a backslash)\&.
.PP
The first character is followed by an optional event designator
(see the section `Event Designators\&') and then an optional word
designator (the section `Word Designators\&'); if neither of these designators is
present, no history expansion occurs\&.
.PP
Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being expanded,
but before any other expansions take place and before the command is
executed\&.  It is this expanded form that is recorded as the history event
for later references\&.
.PP
History expansions do not nest\&.
.PP
By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to the
same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if it
is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the previous
command\&.
However, if the option \fBCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\fP is set, then every history
reference with no event specification \fIalways\fP refers to the previous
command\&.
.PP
For example, `\fB!\fP\&' is the event designator for the previous command, so
`\fB!!:1\fP\&' always refers to the first word of the previous command, and
`\fB!!$\fP\&' always refers to the last word of the previous command\&.  With
\fBCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\fP set, then `\fB!:1\fP\&' and `\fB!$\fP' function in the
same manner as `\fB!!:1\fP\&' and `\fB!!$\fP', respectively\&.  Conversely, if
\fBCSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY\fP is unset, then `\fB!:1\fP\&' and `\fB!$\fP' refer to the
first and last words, respectively, of the same event referenced by the
nearest other history reference preceding them on the current command
line, or to the previous command if there is no preceding reference\&.
.PP
The character sequence `\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\&' (where `\fB^\fP' is
actually the second character of the \fBhistchars\fP parameter)
repeats the last command, replacing the string \fIfoo\fP with \fIbar\fP\&.
More precisely, the sequence `\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\fB^\fP\&' is
synonymous with `\fB!!:s\fP\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\fB^\fP\&', hence other
modifiers (see the section `Modifiers\&') may follow the final `\fB^\fP'\&.
In particular, `\fB^\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB^\fP\fIbar\fP\fB^:G\fP\&' performs a global
substitution\&.
.PP
If the shell encounters the character sequence `\fB!"\fP\&'
in the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled until
the current list (see
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)) is fully parsed\&.  The `\fB!"\fP\&' is removed from the input, and any
subsequent `\fB!\fP\&' characters have no special significance\&.
.PP
A less convenient but more comprehensible form of command history support
is provided by the \fBfc\fP builtin\&.
.SS "Event Designators"
An event designator is a reference to a command\-line entry in the history
list\&.  In the list below, remember that the initial \fB`!\&'\fP in each item
may be changed to another character by setting the \fBhistchars\fP
parameter\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB!\fP
Start a history expansion, except when followed by a blank, newline,
`\fB=\fP\&' or `\fB(\fP'\&.  If followed immediately by a word designator
(see the section `Word Designators\&'), this forms a history reference
with no event designator (see the section `Overview\&')\&.
.TP
\fB!!\fP
Refer to the previous command\&.
By itself, this expansion
repeats the previous command\&.
.TP
\fB!\fP\fIn\fP
Refer to command\-line \fIn\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!\-\fP\fIn\fP
Refer to the current command\-line minus \fIn\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!\fP\fIstr\fP
Refer to the most recent command starting with \fIstr\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!?\fP\fIstr\fP[\fB?\fP]
Refer to the most recent command containing \fIstr\fP\&.  The trailing
`\fB?\fP\&' is necessary if this reference is to be followed by a modifier or
followed by any text that is not to be considered part of \fIstr\fP\&.
.TP
\fB!#\fP
Refer to the current command line typed in so far\&.  The line is
treated as if it were complete up to and including the word before the
one with the `\fB!#\fP\&' reference\&.
.TP
\fB!{\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB}\fP
Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if necessary)\&.
.SS "Word Designators"
A word designator indicates which word or words of a given command line are
to be included in a history reference\&.  A `\fB:\fP\&' usually
separates the event specification from the word designator\&.
It may be omitted only if the word designator begins with a
`\fB^\fP\&', `\fB$\fP', `\fB*\fP', `\fB\-\fP' or `\fB%\fP'\&.
Word designators include:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
\fB0\fP
The first input word (command)\&.
.TP
\fIn\fP
The \fIn\fPth argument\&.
.TP
\fB^\fP
The first argument\&.  That is, \fB1\fP\&.
.TP
\fB$\fP
The last argument\&.
.TP
\fB%\fP
The word matched by (the most recent) \fB?\fP\fIstr\fP search\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB\-\fP\fIy\fP
A range of words; \fIx\fP defaults to \fB0\fP\&.
.TP
\fB*\fP
All the arguments, or a null value if there are none\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB*\fP
Abbreviates `\fIx\fP\fB\-$\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB\-\fP
Like `\fIx\fP\fB*\fP\&' but omitting word \fB$\fP\&.
.PD
.PP
Note that a `\fB%\fP\&' word designator works only when used in one of
`\fB!%\fP\&', `\fB!:%\fP' or `\fB!?\fP\fIstr\fP\fB?:%\fP', and only when used after a
\fB!?\fP expansion (possibly in an earlier command)\&.  Anything else results
in an error, although the error may not be the most obvious one\&.
.SS "Modifiers"
After the optional word designator, you can add
a sequence of one or more of the following modifiers,
each preceded by a `\fB:\fP\&'\&.  These modifiers also work on the result
of \fIfilename generation\fP and \fIparameter expansion\fP, except where
noted\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBa\fP
Turn a file name into an absolute path:  prepends the current directory,
if necessary; remove `\fB\&.\fP\&' path segments; and remove `\fB\&.\&.\fP' path segments
and the segments that immediately precede them\&.
.RS
.PP
This transformation is agnostic about what is in the filesystem, i\&.e\&. is
on the logical, not the physical directory\&.  It takes place in the same
manner as when changing directories when neither of the options
\fBCHASE_DOTS\fP or \fBCHASE_LINKS\fP is set\&.  For example,
`\fB/before/here/\&.\&./after\fP\&' is always transformed to
`\fB/before/after\fP\&', regardless of whether `\fB/before/here\fP' exists or what
kind of object (dir, file, symlink, etc\&.) it is\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBA\fP
Turn a file name into an absolute path as the `\fBa\fP\&' modifier does, and
\fIthen\fP pass the result through the \fBrealpath(3)\fP library
function to resolve symbolic links\&.
.RS
.PP
Note: on systems that do not have a \fBrealpath(3)\fP library
function, symbolic links are not resolved, so on those systems `\fBa\fP\&' and
`\fBA\fP\&' are equivalent\&.
.PP
Note: \fBfoo:A\fP and \fBrealpath(foo)\fP are different on some inputs\&.
For \fBrealpath(foo)\fP semantics, see the `\fBP\fP` modifier\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBc\fP
Resolve a command name into an absolute path by searching the command
path given by the \fBPATH\fP variable\&.  This does not work for commands
containing directory parts\&.  Note also that this does not usually work as
a glob qualifier unless a file of the same name is found in the
current directory\&.
.TP
\fBe\fP
Remove all but the part of the filename extension following the `\fB\&.\fP\&';
see the definition of the filename extension in the description of the
\fBr\fP modifier below\&.  Note that according to that definition the result
will be empty if the string ends with a `\fB\&.\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fBh\fP [ \fIdigits\fP ]
Remove a trailing pathname component, shortening the path by one
directory level: this is the `head\&' of the pathname\&.  This works like
`\fBdirname\fP\&'\&.  If the \fBh\fP is followed immediately (with no spaces or
other separator) by any number of decimal digits, and the value of the
resulting number is non\-zero, that number of leading components is
preserved instead of the final component being removed\&.  In an
absolute path the leading `\fB/\fP\&' is the first component, so,
for example, if \fBvar=/my/path/to/something\fP, then \fB${var:h3}\fP
substitutes \fB/my/path\fP\&.  Consecutive `/\&'s are treated the same as
a single `/\&'\&.  In parameter substitution, digits may only be
used if the expression is in braces, so for example the short form
substitution \fB$var:h2\fP is treated as \fB${var:h}2\fP, not as
\fB${var:h2}\fP\&.  No restriction applies to the use of digits in history
substitution or globbing qualifiers\&.  If more components are requested
than are present, the entire path is substituted (so this does not
trigger a `failed modifier\&' error in history expansion)\&.
.TP
\fBl\fP
Convert the words to all lowercase\&.
.TP
\fBp\fP
Print the new command but do not execute it\&.  Only works with history
expansion\&.
.TP
\fBP\fP
Turn a file name into an absolute path, like \fBrealpath(3)\fP\&.
The resulting path will be absolute,
will refer to the same directory entry as the input filename,
and none of its components will be symbolic links or equal to
`\fB\&.\fP\&' or `\fB\&.\&.\fP'\&.
.RS
.PP
Unlike \fBrealpath(3)\fP, non\-existent trailing components are
permitted and preserved\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBq\fP
Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions\&.  Works
with history expansion and parameter expansion, though for parameters
it is only useful if the resulting text is to be re\-evaluated such as
by \fBeval\fP\&.
.TP
\fBQ\fP
Remove one level of quotes from the substituted words\&.
.TP
\fBr\fP
Remove a filename extension leaving the root name\&.  Strings with no
filename extension are not altered\&.  A filename
extension is a `\fB\&.\fP\&' followed by any number of characters (including
zero) that are neither `\fB\&.\fP\&' nor `\fB/\fP' and that continue to the end
of the string\&.  For example, the extension of
`\fBfoo\&.orig\&.c\fP\&' is `\fB\&.c\fP', and `\fBdir\&.c/foo\fP' has no extension\&.
.TP
\fBs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP[\fB/\fP]
Substitute \fIr\fP for \fIl\fP as described below\&.
The substitution is done only for the
first string that matches \fIl\fP\&.  For arrays and for filename
generation, this applies to each word of the expanded text\&.  See
below for further notes on substitutions\&.
.RS
.PP
The forms `\fBgs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP\&' and `\fBs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP\fB/:G\fP'
perform global substitution, i\&.e\&. substitute every occurrence of \fIr\fP
for \fIl\fP\&.  Note that the \fBg\fP or \fB:G\fP must appear in exactly the
position shown\&.
.PP
See further notes on this form of substitution below\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB&\fP
Repeat the previous \fBs\fP substitution\&.  Like \fBs\fP, may be preceded
immediately by a \fBg\fP\&.  In parameter expansion the \fB&\fP must appear
inside braces, and in filename generation it must be quoted with a
backslash\&.
.TP
\fBt\fP [ \fIdigits\fP ]
Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the final component (tail)\&.
This works like `\fBbasename\fP\&'\&.  Any trailing slashes are first removed\&.
Decimal digits are handled as described above for (h), but in this
case that number of trailing components is preserved instead of
the default 1; 0 is treated the same as 1\&.
.TP
\fBu\fP
Convert the words to all uppercase\&.
.TP
\fBx\fP
Like \fBq\fP, but break into words at whitespace\&.  Does not work with
parameter expansion\&.
.PP
The \fBs/\fP\fIl\fP\fB/\fP\fIr\fP\fB/\fP substitution works as follows\&.  By
default the left\-hand side of substitutions are not patterns, but
character strings\&.  Any character can be used as the delimiter in place
of `\fB/\fP\&'\&.  A backslash quotes the delimiter character\&.  The character
`\fB&\fP\&', in the right\-hand\-side \fIr\fP, is replaced by the text from the
left\-hand\-side \fIl\fP\&.  The `\fB&\fP\&' can be quoted with a backslash\&.  A
null \fIl\fP uses the previous string either from the previous \fIl\fP or
from the contextual scan string \fIs\fP from `\fB!?\fP\fIs\fP\&'\&.  You can
omit the rightmost delimiter if a newline immediately follows \fIr\fP;
the rightmost `\fB?\fP\&' in a context scan can similarly be omitted\&.  Note
the same record of the last \fIl\fP and \fIr\fP is maintained across all
forms of expansion\&.
.PP
Note that if a `\fB&\fP\&' is used within glob qualifiers an extra backslash
is needed as a \fB&\fP is a special character in this case\&.
.PP
Also note that the order of expansions affects the interpretation of
\fIl\fP and \fIr\fP\&.  When used in a history expansion, which occurs before
any other expansions, \fIl\fP and \fIr\fP are treated as literal strings
(except as explained for \fBHIST_SUBST_PATTERN\fP below)\&.  When used in
parameter expansion, the replacement of \fIr\fP into the parameter\&'s value
is done first, and then any additional process, parameter, command,
arithmetic, or brace references are applied, which may evaluate those
substitutions and expansions more than once if \fIl\fP appears more than
once in the starting value\&.  When used in a glob qualifier, any
substitutions or expansions are performed once at the time the qualifier
is parsed, even before the `\fB:s\fP\&' expression itself is divided into
\fIl\fP and \fIr\fP sides\&.
.PP
If the option \fBHIST_SUBST_PATTERN\fP is set, \fIl\fP is treated as
a pattern of the usual form described in
the section FILENAME GENERATION below\&.  This can be used in
all the places where modifiers are available; note, however, that
in globbing qualifiers parameter substitution has already taken place,
so parameters in the replacement string should be quoted to ensure
they are replaced at the correct time\&.
Note also that complicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers may
need the extended glob qualifier notation
\fB(#q:s/\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB/\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB/)\fP in order for the
shell to recognize the expression as a glob qualifier\&.  Further,
note that bad patterns in the substitution are not subject to
the \fBNO_BAD_PATTERN\fP option so will cause an error\&.
.PP
When \fBHIST_SUBST_PATTERN\fP is set, \fIl\fP may start with a \fB#\fP
to indicate that the pattern must match at the start of the string
to be substituted, and a \fB%\fP may appear at the start or after an \fB#\fP
to indicate that the pattern must match at the end of the string
to be substituted\&.  The \fB%\fP or \fB#\fP may be quoted with two
backslashes\&.
.PP
For example, the following piece of filename generation code
with the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBprint \-r \-\- *\&.c(#q:s/#%(#b)s(*)\&.c/\&'S${match[1]}\&.C'/)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
takes the expansion of \fB*\&.c\fP and applies the glob qualifiers in the
\fB(#q\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP expression, which consists of a substitution
modifier anchored to the start and end of each word (\fB#%\fP)\&.  This
turns on backreferences (\fB(#b)\fP), so that the parenthesised
subexpression is available in the replacement string as \fB${match[1]}\fP\&.
The replacement string is quoted so that the parameter is not substituted
before the start of filename generation\&.
.PP
The following \fBf\fP, \fBF\fP, \fBw\fP and \fBW\fP modifiers work only with
parameter expansion and filename generation\&.  They are listed here to
provide a single point of reference for all modifiers\&.
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBf\fP
Repeats the immediately (without a colon) following modifier until the
resulting word doesn\&'t change any more\&.
.TP
\fBF:\fP\fIexpr\fP\fB:\fP
Like \fBf\fP, but repeats only \fIn\fP times if the expression
\fIexpr\fP evaluates to \fIn\fP\&.  Any character can be used instead of
the `\fB:\fP\&'; if `\fB(\fP', `\fB[\fP', or `\fB{\fP'
is used as the opening delimiter,
the closing delimiter should be \&'\fB)\fP', `\fB]\fP', or `\fB}\fP',
respectively\&.
.TP
\fBw\fP
Makes the immediately following modifier work on each word in the
string\&.
.TP
\fBW:\fP\fIsep\fP\fB:\fP
Like \fBw\fP but words are considered to be the parts of the string
that are separated by \fIsep\fP\&. Any character can be used instead of
the `\fB:\fP\&'; opening parentheses are handled specially, see above\&.
.SH "PROCESS SUBSTITUTION"
Each part of a command argument that takes the form
`\fB<(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&',
`\fB>(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&' or
`\fB=(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&'
is subject to process substitution\&.  The expression may be preceded
or followed by other strings except that, to prevent clashes with
commonly occurring strings and patterns, the last
form must occur at the start of a command argument, and the forms
are only expanded when first parsing command or assignment arguments\&.
Process substitutions may be used following redirection operators; in this
case, the substitution must appear with no trailing string\&.
.PP
Note that `\fB<<(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&' is not a special syntax; it
is equivalent to `\fB< <(\fP\fIlist\fP\fB)\fP\&', redirecting
standard input from the result of process substitution\&.  Hence all
the following documentation applies\&.  The second form (with the space)
is recommended for clarity\&.
.PP
In the case of the \fB<\fP or \fB>\fP forms, the shell runs the commands in
\fIlist\fP as a subprocess of the job executing the shell command line\&.
If the system supports the \fB/dev/fd\fP
mechanism, the command argument is the name of the device file
corresponding to a file descriptor; otherwise, if the system supports named
pipes (FIFOs), the command argument will be a named pipe\&.  If the form with
\fB>\fP is selected then writing on this special file will provide input for
\fIlist\fP\&.  If \fB<\fP is used, then the file passed as an argument will
be connected to the output of the \fIlist\fP process\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB) |
tee >(\fP\fIprocess1\fP\fB) >(\fP\fIprocess2\fP\fB) >/dev/null\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files \fIfile1\fP and \fIfile2\fP respectively,
pastes the results together, and sends it to the processes
\fIprocess1\fP and \fIprocess2\fP\&.
.PP
If \fB=(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP is used instead of
\fB<(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP,
then the file passed as an argument will be the name
of a temporary file containing the output of the \fIlist\fP
process\&.  This may be used instead of the \fB<\fP
form for a program that expects to lseek (see \fIlseek\fP(2))
on the input file\&.
.PP
There is an optimisation for substitutions of the form
\fB=(<<<\fP\fIarg\fP\fB)\fP, where \fIarg\fP is a single\-word argument
to the here\-string redirection \fB<<<\fP\&.  This form produces a file name
containing the value of \fIarg\fP after any substitutions have been
performed\&.  This is handled entirely within the current shell\&.  This is
effectively the reverse of the special form \fB$(<\fP\fIarg\fP\fB)\fP
which treats \fIarg\fP as a file name and replaces it with the file\&'s
contents\&.
.PP
The \fB=\fP form is useful as both the \fB/dev/fd\fP and the named pipe
implementation of \fB<(\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP have drawbacks\&.  In
the former case, some programmes may automatically close the file
descriptor in question before examining the file on the command line,
particularly if this is necessary for security reasons such as when the
programme is running setuid\&.  In the second case, if the
programme does not actually open the file, the subshell attempting to read
from or write to the pipe will (in a typical implementation, different
operating systems may have different behaviour) block for ever and have to
be killed explicitly\&.  In both cases, the shell actually supplies the
information using a pipe, so that programmes that expect to lseek
(see \fIlseek\fP(2)) on the file will not work\&.
.PP
Also note that the previous example can be more compactly and
efficiently written (provided the \fBMULTIOS\fP option is set) as:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB)\fP \fB> >(\fP\fIprocess1\fP\fB) > >(\fP\fIprocess2\fP\fB)\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The shell uses pipes instead of FIFOs to implement the latter
two process substitutions in the above example\&.
.PP
There is an additional problem with \fB>(\fP\fIprocess\fP\fB)\fP; when
this is attached to an external command, the parent shell does not wait
for \fIprocess\fP to finish and hence an immediately following command
cannot rely on the results being complete\&.  The problem and solution are
the same as described in the section \fIMULTIOS\fP in
\fIzshmisc\fP(1)\&.  Hence in a simplified
version of the example above:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fBpaste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB)\fP \fB> >(\fP\fIprocess\fP\fB)\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
(note that no \fBMULTIOS\fP are involved), \fIprocess\fP will be run
asynchronously as far as the parent shell is concerned\&.  The workaround is:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB\fB{ paste <(cut \-f1\fP \fIfile1\fP\fB) <(cut \-f3\fP \fIfile2\fP\fB) }\fP \fB> >(\fP\fIprocess\fP\fB)\fP\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The extra processes here are
spawned from the parent shell which will wait for their completion\&.
.PP
Another problem arises any time a job with a substitution that requires
a temporary file is disowned by the shell, including the case where
`\fB&!\fP\&' or `\fB&|\fP' appears at the end of a command containing a
substitution\&.  In that case the temporary file will not be cleaned up as
the shell no longer has any memory of the job\&.  A workaround is to use
a subshell, for example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB(mycmd =(myoutput)) &!\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
as the forked subshell will wait for the command to finish then remove
the temporary file\&.
.PP
A general workaround to ensure a process substitution endures for
an appropriate length of time is to pass it as a parameter to
an anonymous shell function (a piece of shell code that is run
immediately with function scope)\&.  For example, this code:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fB() {
   print File $1:
   cat $1
} =(print This be the verse)\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
outputs something resembling the following
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBFile /tmp/zsh6nU0kS:
This be the verse\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The temporary file created by the process substitution will be deleted
when the function exits\&.
.PP
.SH "PARAMETER EXPANSION"
The character `\fB$\fP\&' is used to introduce parameter expansions\&.
See
\fIzshparam\fP(1)
for a description of parameters, including arrays, associative arrays,
and subscript notation to access individual array elements\&.
.PP
Note in particular the fact that words of unquoted parameters are not

This syntax gives effects similar to parameter subscripting

If \fIoffset\fP is non\-negative, then if the variable \fIname\fP is a

elements starting \fIoffset\fP elements from the first element\&.  If
\fIlength\fP is given, substitute that many characters or elements,
otherwise the entire rest of the scalar or array\&.
.PP
A positive \fIoffset\fP is always treated as the offset of a character or
element in \fIname\fP from the first character or element of the array
(this is different from native zsh subscript notation)\&.  Hence 0
refers to the first character or element regardless of the setting of
the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP\&.
.PP
A negative offset counts backwards from the end of the scalar or array,
so that \-1 corresponds to the last character or element, and so on\&.

When positive, \fIlength\fP counts from the \fIoffset\fP position
toward the end of the scalar or array\&.  When negative, \fIlength\fP

\fIoffset\fP and \fIlength\fP undergo the same set of shell substitutions

.PP
all have the same effect, extracting the string starting at the fourth
character of \fB$foo\fP if the substitution would otherwise return a scalar,
or the array starting at the fourth element if \fB$foo\fP would return an
array\&.  Note that with the option \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP \fB$foo\fP always returns
a scalar (regardless of the use of the offset syntax) and a form
such as \fB${foo[*]:3}\fP is required to extract elements of an array named
\fBfoo\fP\&.
.PP
If \fIoffset\fP is negative, the \fB\-\fP may not appear immediately
after the \fB:\fP as this indicates the
\fB${\fP\fIname\fP\fB:\-\fP\fIword\fP\fB}\fP form of substitution\&.  Instead, a space
may be inserted before the \fB\-\fP\&.  Furthermore, neither \fIoffset\fP nor
\fIlength\fP may begin with an alphabetic character or \fB&\fP as these are
used to indicate history\-style modifiers\&.  To substitute a value from a
variable, the recommended approach is to precede it with a \fB$\fP as this
signifies the intention (parameter substitution can easily be rendered
unreadable); however, as arithmetic substitution is performed, the
expression \fB${var: offs}\fP does work, retrieving the offset from
\fB$offs\fP\&.
.PP
For further compatibility with other shells there is a special case
for array offset 0\&.  This usually accesses the
first element of the array\&.  However, if the substitution refers to the
positional parameter array, e\&.g\&. \fB$@\fP or \fB$*\fP, then offset 0
instead refers to \fB$0\fP, offset 1 refers to \fB$1\fP, and so on\&.  In
other words, the positional parameter array is effectively extended by
prepending \fB$0\fP\&.  Hence \fB${*:0:1}\fP substitutes \fB$0\fP and
\fB${*:1:1}\fP substitutes \fB$1\fP\&.

\fBn\fP
Sort decimal integers numerically; if the first differing

is lexical\&.  `\fB+\fP\&' and `\fB\-\fP' are not treated specially; they are treated as
any other non\-digit\&.  Integers with more initial zeroes
are sorted before those with fewer or none\&.  Hence the array `\fBfoo+24 foo1 foo02

Sort the resulting words in ascending order; if this appears on its

This forces the value of the parameter \fIname\fP to be interpreted as a

\fB${(P)${foo}}\fP, and \fB${(P)$(echo bar)}\fP will be expanded to
`\fBbaz\fP\&'\&.

Likewise, if the reference is itself nested, the expression with the

\fB1\&.\fP \fINested substitution\fP
If multiple nested \fB${\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP forms are present, substitution is
performed from the inside outwards\&.  At each level, the substitution takes
account of whether the current value is a scalar or an array, whether the
whole substitution is in double quotes, and what flags are supplied to the
current level of substitution, just as if the nested substitution were the
outermost\&.  The flags are not propagated up to enclosing
substitutions; the nested substitution will return either a scalar or an
array as determined by the flags, possibly adjusted for quoting\&.  All the
following steps take place where applicable at all levels of substitution\&.
.RS
.PP
Note that, unless the `\fB(P)\fP\&' flag is present, the flags and any
subscripts apply directly to the value of the nested substitution; for
example, the expansion \fB${${foo}}\fP behaves exactly the same as
\fB${foo}\fP\&.  When the `\fB(P)\fP\&' flag is present in a nested substitution,
the other substitution rules are applied to the value \fIbefore\fP it is
interpreted as a name, so \fB${${(P)foo}}\fP may differ from \fB${(P)foo}\fP\&.
.PP
At each nested level of substitution, the substituted words undergo all
forms of single\-word substitution (i\&.e\&. not filename generation), including
command substitution, arithmetic expansion and filename expansion
(i\&.e\&. leading \fB~\fP and \fB=\fP)\&.  Thus, for example, \fB${${:\-=cat}:h}\fP
expands to the directory where the \fBcat\fP program resides\&.  (Explanation:
the internal substitution has no parameter but a default value \fB=cat\fP,
which is expanded by filename expansion to a full path; the outer
substitution then applies the modifier \fB:h\fP and takes the directory part
of the path\&.)

At the outermost level of substitution, the `\fB(P)\fP\&' flag (rule \fB4\&.\fP)

If the value is a raw parameter reference with a subscript, such as

subscripts apply to the scalar or array value yielded by the previous
subscript\&.  Thus if \fBvar\fP is an array, \fB${var[1][2]}\fP is the second
character of the first word, but \fB${var[2,4][2]}\fP is the entire third
word (the second word of the range of words two through four of the

The flag \fBf\fP is useful to split a double\-quoted substitution line by

substitutes the contents of \fIfile\fP divided so that each line is
an element of the resulting array\&.  Compare this with the effect of
\fB$\fP\fB(<\fP\fIfile\fP\fB)\fP alone, which divides the file
up by words, or the same inside double quotes, which makes the entire

This produces the result \fBb\fP\&.  First, the inner substitution
\fB"${foo}"\fP, which has no array (\fB@\fP) flag, produces a single word
result \fB"bar baz"\fP\&.  The outer substitution \fB"${(@)\&.\&.\&.[1]}"\fP detects
that this is a scalar, so that (despite the `\fB(@)\fP\&' flag) the subscript
picks the first character\&.
.TP
\fB"${${(@)foo}[1]}"\fP
This produces the result `\fBbar\fP\&'\&.  In this case, the inner substitution
\fB"${(@)foo}"\fP produces the array `\fB(bar baz\fP\fB)\fP\&'\&.  The outer
substitution \fB"${\&.\&.\&.[1]}"\fP detects that this is an array and picks the
first word\&.  This is similar to the simple case \fB"${foo[1]}"\fP\&.

\fB${(s/x/)foo%%1*}\fP
produces `\fBa\fP\&' and `\fB b\fP' (note the extra space)\&.  As substitution
occurs before either joining or splitting, the operation  first generates
the modified array \fB(ax bx\fP\fB)\fP, which is joined to give

\fIn1\fP and \fIn2\fP inclusive\&.  If either number begins with a
zero, all the resulting numbers will be padded with leading zeroes to
that minimum width, but for negative numbers the \fB\-\fP character is also
included in the width\&.  If the numbers are in decreasing order the
resulting sequence will also be in decreasing order\&.
.PP
An expression of the form `\fB{\fP\fIn1\fP\fB\&.\&.\fP\fIn2\fP\fB\&.\&.\fP\fIn3\fP\fB}\fP\&',
where \fIn1\fP, \fIn2\fP, and \fIn3\fP are integers,
is expanded as above, but only every \fIn3\fPth number starting from \fIn1\fP
is output\&.  If \fIn3\fP is negative the numbers are output in reverse order,
this is slightly different from simply swapping \fIn1\fP and \fIn2\fP in the case
that the step \fIn3\fP doesn\&'t evenly divide the range\&.  Zero padding can be
specified in any of the three numbers, specifying it in the third can be useful
to pad for example `\fB{\-99\&.\&.100\&.\&.01}\fP\&' which is not possible to specify by putting a
0 on either of the first two numbers (i\&.e\&. pad to two characters)\&.

An expression of the form `\fB{\fP\fIc1\fP\fB\&.\&.\fP\fIc2\fP\fB}\fP\&', where
\fIc1\fP and \fIc2\fP are single characters (which may be multibyte
characters), is expanded to every character in the range from \fIc1\fP to
\fIc2\fP in whatever character sequence is used internally\&.  For
characters with code points below 128 this is US ASCII (this is the only
case most users will need)\&.  If any intervening character is not
printable, appropriate quotation is used to render it printable\&.
If the character sequence is reversed, the output is in reverse
order, e\&.g\&. `\fB{d\&.\&.a}\fP\&' is substituted as `\fBd c b a\fP'\&.
.PP
If a brace expression matches none of the above forms, it is left
unchanged, unless the option \fBBRACE_CCL\fP (an abbreviation for `brace
character class\&') is set\&.
In that case, it is expanded to a list of the individual
characters between the braces sorted into the order of the characters
in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not currently
handled)\&.  The syntax is similar to a
\fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP expression in filename generation:
`\fB\-\fP\&' is treated specially to denote a range of characters, but `\fB^\fP' or
`\fB!\fP\&' as the first character is treated normally\&.  For example,
`\fB{abcdef0\-9}\fP\&' expands to 16 words \fB0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f\fP\&.
.PP
Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation (globbing); an
expression such as \fB*/{foo,bar}\fP is split into two separate words
\fB*/foo\fP and \fB*/bar\fP before filename generation takes place\&.  In
particular, note that this is liable to produce a `no match\&' error if
\fIeither\fP of the two expressions does not match; this is to be contrasted
with \fB*/(foo|bar)\fP, which is treated as a single pattern but otherwise
has similar effects\&.

.SS "Dynamic named directories"
If the function \fBzsh_directory_name\fP exists, or the shell variable
\fBzsh_directory_name_functions\fP exists and contains an array of
function names, then the functions are used to implement dynamic
directory naming\&.  The functions are tried in order until one returns
status zero, so it is important that functions test whether they can
handle the case in question and return an appropriate status\&.
.PP
A `\fB~\fP\&' followed by a string \fInamstr\fP in unquoted square brackets is
treated specially as a dynamic directory name\&.  Note that the first
unquoted closing square bracket always terminates \fInamstr\fP\&.  The shell
function is passed two arguments: the string \fBn\fP (for name) and
\fInamstr\fP\&.  It should either set the array \fBreply\fP to a single element
which is the directory corresponding to the name and return status zero
(executing an assignment as the last statement is usually sufficient), or
it should return status non\-zero\&.  In the former case the element of reply
is used as the directory; in the latter case the substitution is deemed to
have failed\&.  If all functions fail and the option \fBNOMATCH\fP is set,
an error results\&.
.PP
The functions defined as above are also used to see if a directory can
be turned into a name, for example when printing the directory stack or
when expanding \fB%~\fP in prompts\&.  In this case each function is passed two
arguments: the string \fBd\fP (for directory) and the candidate for dynamic
naming\&.  The function should either return non\-zero status, if the
directory cannot be named by the function, or it should set the array reply
to consist of two elements: the first is the dynamic name for the directory
(as would appear within `\fB~[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&'), and the second is the
prefix length of the directory to be replaced\&.  For example, if the trial
directory is \fB/home/myname/src/zsh\fP and the dynamic name for
\fB/home/myname/src\fP (which has 16 characters) is \fBs\fP, then the function
sets

It is not a requirement that a function implements both
\fBn\fP and \fBd\fP calls; for example, it might be appropriate for certain
dynamic forms of expansion not to be contracted to names\&.  In that case
any call with the first argument \fBd\fP should cause a non\-zero status to
be returned\&.

Filename expansion is performed on the right hand side of a parameter

If the \fBKSH_GLOB\fP option is set, then a
`\fB@\fP\&', `\fB*\fP', `\fB+\fP', `\fB?\fP' or `\fB!\fP' immediately preceding
the `\fB(\fP\&' is treated specially, as detailed below\&. The option
\fBSH_GLOB\fP prevents bare parentheses from being used in this way, though
the \fBKSH_GLOB\fP option is still available\&.
.RS
.PP
Note that grouping cannot extend over multiple directories: it is an error
to have a `\fB/\fP\&' within a group (this only applies for patterns used in
filename generation)\&.  There is one exception:  a group of the form
\fB(\fP\fIpat\fP\fB/)#\fP appearing as a complete path segment can
match a sequence of directories\&.  For example, \fBfoo/(a*/)#bar\fP matches
\fBfoo/bar\fP, \fBfoo/any/bar\fP, \fBfoo/any/anyother/bar\fP, and so on\&.
.RE
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB|\fP\fIy\fP
Matches either \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP\&.
This operator has lower precedence than any other\&.
The `\fB|\fP\&' character
must be within parentheses, to avoid interpretation as a pipeline\&.
The alternatives are tried in order from left to right\&.
.TP
\fB^\fP\fIx\fP
(Requires \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP to be set\&.)
Matches anything except the pattern \fIx\fP\&.
This has a higher precedence than `\fB/\fP\&', so `\fB^foo/bar\fP'
will search directories in `\fB\&.\fP\&' except `\fB\&./foo\fP'
for a file named `\fBbar\fP\&'\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB~\fP\fIy\fP
(Requires \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP to be set\&.)
Match anything that matches the pattern \fIx\fP but does not match \fIy\fP\&.
This has lower precedence than any operator except `\fB|\fP\&', so
`\fB*/*~foo/bar\fP\&' will search for all files in all directories in `\fB\&.\fP'
and then exclude `\fBfoo/bar\fP\&' if there was such a match\&.
Multiple patterns can be excluded by
`\fIfoo\fP\fB~\fP\fIbar\fP\fB~\fP\fIbaz\fP\&'\&.
In the exclusion pattern (\fIy\fP), `\fB/\fP\&' and `\fB\&.\fP' are not treated
specially the way they usually are in globbing\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB#\fP
(Requires \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP to be set\&.)
Matches zero or more occurrences of the pattern \fIx\fP\&.
This operator has high precedence; `\fB12#\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB1(2#)\fP',
rather than `\fB(12)#\fP\&'\&.  It is an error for an unquoted `\fB#\fP' to follow
something which cannot be repeated; this includes an empty string, a
pattern already followed by `\fB##\fP\&', or parentheses when part of a
\fBKSH_GLOB\fP pattern (for example, `\fB!(\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB)#\fP\&' is
invalid and must be replaced by
`\fB*(!(\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB))\fP\&')\&.
.TP
\fIx\fP\fB##\fP
(Requires \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP to be set\&.)
Matches one or more occurrences of the pattern \fIx\fP\&.
This operator has high precedence; `\fB12##\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB1(2##)\fP',
rather than `\fB(12)##\fP\&'\&.  No more than two active `\fB#\fP' characters may
appear together\&.  (Note the potential clash with glob qualifiers in the
form `\fB1(2##)\fP\&' which should therefore be avoided\&.)
.SS "ksh\-like Glob Operators"
If the \fBKSH_GLOB\fP option is set, the effects of parentheses can be
modified by a preceding `\fB@\fP\&', `\fB*\fP', `\fB+\fP', `\fB?\fP' or `\fB!\fP'\&.

.SS "Precedence"
The precedence of the operators given above is (highest) `\fB^\fP\&', `\fB/\fP',
`\fB~\fP\&', `\fB|\fP' (lowest); the
remaining operators are simply treated from left to right as part of a
string, with `\fB#\fP\&' and `\fB##\fP' applying to the shortest possible
preceding unit (i\&.e\&. a character, `\fB?\fP\&', `\fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP',
`\fB<\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB>\fP\&', or a parenthesised expression)\&.  As mentioned
above, a `\fB/\fP\&' used as a directory separator may not appear inside
parentheses, while a `\fB|\fP\&' must do so; in patterns used in other contexts
than filename generation (for example, in \fBcase\fP statements and tests
within `\fB[[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]]\fP\&'), a `\fB/\fP' is not special; and `\fB/\fP' is also
not special after a `\fB~\fP\&' appearing outside parentheses in a filename
pattern\&.
.SS "Globbing Flags"
There are various flags which affect any text to their right up to the
end of the enclosing group or to the end of the pattern; they require
the \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP option\&. All take the form
\fB(#\fP\fIX\fP\fB)\fP where \fIX\fP may have one of the following
forms:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fBi\fP
Case insensitive:  upper or lower case characters in the pattern match
upper or lower case characters\&.
.TP
\fBl\fP
Lower case characters in the pattern match upper or lower case
characters; upper case characters in the pattern still only match
upper case characters\&.
.TP
\fBI\fP
Case sensitive:  locally negates the effect of \fBi\fP or \fBl\fP from
that point on\&.
.TP
\fBb\fP
Activate backreferences for parenthesised groups in the pattern;
this does not work in filename generation\&.  When a pattern with a set of
active parentheses is matched, the strings matched by the groups are
stored in the array \fB$match\fP, the indices of the beginning of the matched
parentheses in the array \fB$mbegin\fP, and the indices of the end in the array
\fB$mend\fP, with the first element of each array corresponding to the first
parenthesised group, and so on\&.  These arrays are not otherwise special to
the shell\&.  The indices use the same convention as does parameter
substitution, so that elements of \fB$mend\fP and \fB$mbegin\fP may be used in
subscripts; the \fBKSH_ARRAYS\fP option is respected\&.  Sets of globbing flags
are not considered parenthesised groups; only the first nine active
parentheses can be referenced\&.
.RS
.PP
For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBfoo="a_string_with_a_message"
if [[ $foo = (a|an)_(#b)(*) ]]; then
  print ${foo[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}
fi\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
prints `\fBstring_with_a_message\fP\&'\&.
Note that the first set of parentheses is before the
\fB(#b)\fP and does not create a backreference\&.
.PP
Backreferences work with all forms of pattern matching other than filename
generation, but note that when performing matches on an entire array, such
as \fB${\fP\fIarray\fP\fB#\fP\fIpattern\fP\fB}\fP, or a global substitution, such
as \fB${\fP\fIparam\fP\fB//\fP\fIpat\fP\fB/\fP\fIrepl\fP\fB}\fP, only the data for the
last match remains available\&.  In the case of global replacements this may
still be useful\&.  See the example for the \fBm\fP flag below\&.
.PP
The numbering of backreferences strictly follows the order of the opening
parentheses from left to right in the pattern string, although sets of
parentheses may be nested\&.  There are special rules for parentheses followed
by `\fB#\fP\&' or `\fB##\fP'\&.  Only the last match of the parenthesis is
remembered: for example, in `\fB[[ abab = (#b)([ab])# ]]\fP\&', only the final
`\fBb\fP\&' is stored in \fBmatch[1]\fP\&.  Thus extra parentheses may be necessary
to match the complete segment: for example, use
`\fBX((ab|cd)#)Y\fP\&' to match
a whole string of either `\fBab\fP\&' or `\fBcd\fP' between `\fBX\fP' and `\fBY\fP',
using the value of \fB$match[1]\fP rather than \fB$match[2]\fP\&.
.PP
If the match fails none of the parameters is altered, so in some cases it
may be necessary to initialise them beforehand\&.  If some of the
backreferences fail to match \-\- which happens if they are in an alternate
branch which fails to match, or if they are followed by \fB#\fP and matched
zero times \-\- then the matched string is set to the empty string, and the
start and end indices are set to \-1\&.
.PP
Pattern matching with backreferences is slightly slower than without\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBB\fP
Deactivate backreferences, negating the effect of the \fBb\fP flag from that
point on\&.
.TP
\fBc\fP\fIN\fP\fB,\fP\fIM\fP
The flag \fB(#c\fP\fIN\fP\fB,\fP\fIM\fP\fB)\fP can be used anywhere
that the \fB#\fP or \fB##\fP operators can be used except in the expressions
`\fB(*/)#\fP\&' and `\fB(*/)##\fP' in filename generation, where `\fB/\fP'
has special meaning; it cannot be combined with other globbing flags and
a bad pattern error occurs if it is misplaced\&.  It is equivalent to the
form \fB{\fP\fIN\fP\fB,\fP\fIM\fP\fB}\fP in regular expressions\&.  The previous
character or group is required to match between \fIN\fP and \fIM\fP times,
inclusive\&.  The form \fB(#c\fP\fIN\fP\fB)\fP requires exactly \fBN\fP
matches; \fB(#c,\fP\fIM\fP\fB)\fP is equivalent to specifying \fIN\fP
as 0; \fB(#c\fP\fIN\fP\fB,)\fP specifies that there is no maximum
limit on the number of matches\&.
.TP
\fBm\fP
Set references to the match data for the entire string matched; this is
similar to backreferencing and does not work in filename generation\&.  The
flag must be in effect at the end of the pattern, i\&.e\&. not local to a
group\&. The parameters \fB$MATCH\fP,  \fB$MBEGIN\fP and \fB$MEND\fP will be set to
the string matched and to the indices of the beginning and end of the
string, respectively\&.  This is most useful in parameter substitutions, as
otherwise the string matched is obvious\&.

.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBarr=(veldt jynx grimps waqf zho buck)

forces all the matches (i\&.e\&. all vowels) into uppercase, printing

\fBM\fP

\fBa\fP\fInum\fP
Approximate matching: \fInum\fP errors are allowed in the string matched by
the pattern\&.  The rules for this are described in the next subsection\&.
.TP
\fBs\fP, \fBe\fP
Unlike the other flags, these have only a local effect, and each must
appear on its own:  `\fB(#s)\fP\&' and `\fB(#e)\fP' are the only valid forms\&.
The `\fB(#s)\fP\&' flag succeeds only at the start of the test string, and the
`\fB(#e)\fP\&' flag succeeds only at the end of the test string; they
correspond to `\fB^\fP\&' and `\fB$\fP' in standard regular expressions\&.  They
are useful for matching path segments in patterns other than those in
filename generation (where path segments are in any case treated
separately)\&.  For example, `\fB*((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)*\fP\&' matches
a path segment `\fBtest\fP\&' in any of the following strings: \fBtest\fP,
\fBtest/at/start\fP, \fBat/end/test\fP, \fBin/test/middle\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
Another use is in parameter substitution; for example
`\fB${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)}\fP\&' will remove only elements of an
array which
match the complete pattern `\fBA*Z\fP\&'\&.  There are other ways of performing
many operations of this type, however the combination of the substitution
operations `\fB/\fP\&' and `\fB//\fP' with the `\fB(#s)\fP' and `\fB(#e)\fP' flags
provides a single simple and memorable method\&.
.PP
Note that assertions of the form `\fB(^(#s))\fP\&' also work, i\&.e\&. match
anywhere except at the start of the string, although this actually means
`anything except a zero\-length portion at the start of the string\&'; you
need to use `\fB(""~(#s))\fP\&' to match a zero\-length portion of the string
not at the start\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBq\fP
A `\fBq\fP\&' and everything up to the closing parenthesis of the globbing
flags are ignored by the pattern matching code\&.  This is intended to
support the use of glob qualifiers, see below\&.  The result is that
the pattern `\fB(#b)(*)\&.c(#q\&.)\fP\&' can be used both for globbing
and for
matching against a string\&.  In the former case, the `\fB(#q\&.)\fP\&' will be
treated as a glob qualifier and the `\fB(#b)\fP\&' will not be useful, while in
the latter case the `\fB(#b)\fP\&' is useful for backreferences and the
`\fB(#q\&.)\fP\&' will be ignored\&.  Note that colon modifiers in the glob
qualifiers are also not applied in ordinary pattern matching\&.
.TP
\fBu\fP
Respect the current locale in determining the presence of multibyte
characters in a pattern, provided the shell was compiled with
\fBMULTIBYTE_SUPPORT\fP\&.  This overrides the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP
option; the default behaviour is taken from the option\&.  Compare \fBU\fP\&.
(Mnemonic: typically multibyte characters are from Unicode in the UTF\-8
encoding, although any extension of ASCII supported by the system
library may be used\&.)
.TP
\fBU\fP
All characters are considered to be a single byte long\&.  The opposite
of \fBu\fP\&.  This overrides the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP option\&.
.PP
For example, the test string \fBfooxx\fP can be matched by the pattern
\fB(#i\fP\fB)FOOXX\fP, but not by \fB(#l\fP\fB)FOOXX\fP,
\fB(#i\fP\fB)FOO\fP\fB(#I\fP\fB)XX\fP or
\fB((#i\fP\fB)FOOX\fP\fB)X\fP\&.  The string
\fB(#ia2\fP\fB)readme\fP specifies case\-insensitive matching of
\fBreadme\fP with up to two errors\&.
.PP
When using the ksh syntax for grouping both \fBKSH_GLOB\fP and
\fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP must be set and the left parenthesis should be
preceded by \fB@\fP\&.  Note also that the flags do not affect letters
inside \fB[\fP\&.\&.\&.\fB]\fP groups, in other words \fB(#i\fP\fB)[a\-z]\fP
still matches only lowercase letters\&.  Finally, note that when
examining whole paths case\-insensitively every directory must be
searched for all files which match, so that a pattern of the form
\fB(#i\fP\fB)/foo/bar/\&.\&.\&.\fP is potentially slow\&.
.PP
.SS "Approximate Matching"
When matching approximately, the shell keeps a count of the errors found,
which cannot exceed the number specified in the
\fB(#a\fP\fInum\fP\fB)\fP flags\&.  Four types of error are recognised:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
1\&.
Different characters, as in \fBfooxbar\fP and \fBfooybar\fP\&.
.TP
2\&.
Transposition of characters, as in \fBbanana\fP and \fBabnana\fP\&.
.TP
3\&.
A character missing in the target string, as with the pattern \fBroad\fP and
target string \fBrod\fP\&.
.TP
4\&.
An extra character appearing in the target string, as with \fBstove\fP
and \fBstrove\fP\&.
.PP
Thus, the pattern \fB(#a3\fP\fB)abcd\fP matches \fBdcba\fP, with the
errors occurring by using the first rule twice and the second once,
grouping the string as \fB[d][cb][a]\fP and \fB[a][bc][d]\fP\&.
.PP
Non\-literal parts of the pattern must match exactly, including characters
in character ranges: hence \fB(#a1\fP\fB)???\fP  matches strings of
length four, by applying rule 4 to an empty part of the pattern, but not
strings of length two, since all the \fB?\fP must match\&.  Other characters
which must match exactly are initial dots in filenames (unless the
\fBGLOB_DOTS\fP option is set), and all slashes in filenames, so that
\fBa/bc\fP is two errors from \fBab/c\fP (the slash cannot be transposed with
another character)\&.  Similarly, errors are counted separately for
non\-contiguous strings in the pattern, so that \fB(ab|cd\fP\fB)ef\fP
is two errors from \fBaebf\fP\&.
.PP
When using exclusion via the \fB~\fP operator, approximate matching is
treated entirely separately for the excluded part and must be activated
separately\&.  Thus, \fB(#a1\fP\fB)README~READ_ME\fP matches
\fBREAD\&.ME\fP but not \fBREAD_ME\fP, as the trailing \fBREAD_ME\fP is matched
without approximation\&.  However,
\fB(#a1\fP\fB)README~(#a1\fP\fB)READ_ME\fP
does not match any pattern of the form \fBREAD\fP\fI?\fP\fBME\fP as all
such forms are now excluded\&.
.PP
Apart from exclusions, there is only one overall error count; however, the
maximum errors allowed may be altered locally, and this can be delimited by
grouping\&.  For example,
\fB(#a1\fP\fB)cat\fP\fB((#a0\fP\fB)dog\fP\fB)fox\fP
allows one error in total, which may not occur in the \fBdog\fP section, and
the pattern
\fB(#a1\fP\fB)cat\fP\fB(#a0\fP\fB)dog\fP\fB(#a1\fP\fB)fox\fP
is equivalent\&.  Note that the point at which an error is first found is the
crucial one for establishing whether to use approximation; for example,
\fB(#a1)abc(#a0)xyz\fP will not match \fBabcdxyz\fP, because the
error occurs at the `\fBx\fP\&', where approximation is turned off\&.
.PP
Entire path segments may be matched approximately, so that
`\fB(#a1)/foo/d/is/available/at/the/bar\fP\&' allows one error in any path
segment\&.  This is much less efficient than without the \fB(#a1)\fP, however,
since every directory in the path must be scanned for a possible
approximate match\&.  It is best to place the \fB(#a1)\fP after any path
segments which are known to be correct\&.
.PP
.SS "Recursive Globbing"
A pathname component of the form `\fB(\fP\fIfoo\fP\fB/)#\fP\&'
matches a path consisting of zero or more directories
matching the pattern \fIfoo\fP\&.
.PP
As a shorthand, `\fB**/\fP\&' is equivalent to `\fB(*/)#\fP'; note that this
therefore matches files in the current directory as well as
subdirectories\&.
Thus:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBls \-ld \-\- (*/)#bar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
or
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBls \-ld \-\- **/bar\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
does a recursive directory search for files named `\fBbar\fP\&' (potentially
including the file `\fBbar\fP\&' in the current directory)\&.  This form does not
follow symbolic links; the alternative form `\fB***/\fP\&' does, but is
otherwise identical\&.  Neither of these can be combined with other forms of
globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the `\fB*\fP\&'
operators revert to their usual effect\&.
.PP
Even shorter forms are available when the option \fBGLOB_STAR_SHORT\fP is
set\&.  In that case if no \fB/\fP immediately follows a \fB**\fP or \fB***\fP
they are treated as if both a \fB/\fP plus a further \fB*\fP are present\&.
Hence:

.RS
.nf

.SS "Glob Qualifiers"
Patterns used for filename generation may end in a
list of qualifiers enclosed in parentheses\&.
The qualifiers specify which filenames that otherwise match the given pattern
will be inserted in the argument list\&.
.PP
If the option \fBBARE_GLOB_QUAL\fP is set, then a trailing set of parentheses
containing no `\fB|\fP\&' or `\fB(\fP' characters (or `\fB~\fP' if it is special)
is taken as a set of
glob qualifiers\&.  A glob subexpression that would normally be taken as glob
qualifiers, for example `\fB(^x)\fP\&', can be forced to be treated as part of
the glob pattern by doubling the parentheses, in this case producing
`\fB((^x))\fP\&'\&.
.PP
If the option \fBEXTENDED_GLOB\fP is set, a different syntax for glob
qualifiers is available, namely `\fB(#q\fP\fIx\fP\fB)\fP\&'
where \fIx\fP is any of the same
glob qualifiers used in the other format\&.  The qualifiers must still appear
at the end of the pattern\&.  However, with this syntax multiple glob
qualifiers may be chained together\&.  They are treated as a logical AND of
the individual sets of flags\&.  Also, as the syntax is unambiguous, the
expression will be treated as glob qualifiers just as long any parentheses
contained within it are balanced; appearance of `\fB|\fP\&', `\fB(\fP' or
`\fB~\fP\&' does not negate the effect\&.  Note that qualifiers will be
recognised in this form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the end of
the pattern, for example `\fB*(#q*)(\&.)\fP\&' will recognise executable regular
files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax should probably be
avoided for the sake of clarity\&.  Note that within conditions using the
`\fB[[\fP\&' form the presence of a parenthesised expression
\fB(#q\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP at the end of a string indicates that globbing
should be performed; the expression may include glob qualifiers, but
it is also valid if it is simply \fB(#q)\fP\&.  This does
not apply to the right hand side of pattern match operators as the
syntax already has special significance\&.

same as for `\fB=\fP\&'\&. The octal number describes the mode bits to be
expected, if combined with a `\fB=\fP\&', the value given must match the
file\-modes exactly, with a `\fB+\fP\&', at least the bits in the
given number must be set in the file\-modes, and with a `\fB\-\fP\&', the
bits in the number must not be set\&. Giving a `\fB?\fP\&' instead of a
octal digit anywhere in the number ensures that the corresponding bits
in the file\-modes are not checked, this is only useful in combination
with `\fB=\fP\&'\&.
.RS

If the qualifier `\fBf\fP\&' is followed by any other character anything
up to the next matching character (`\fB[\fP\&', `\fB{\fP', and `\fB<\fP' match
`\fB]\fP\&', `\fB}\fP', and `\fB>\fP' respectively, any other character
matches itself) is taken as a list of comma\-separated
\fIsub\-spec\fPs\&. Each \fIsub\-spec\fP may be either an octal number as
described above or a list of any of the characters `\fBu\fP\&', `\fBg\fP',
`\fBo\fP\&', and `\fBa\fP', followed by a `\fB=\fP', a `\fB+\fP', or a
`\fB\-\fP\&', followed by a list of any of the characters `\fBr\fP', `\fBw\fP',
`\fBx\fP\&', `\fBs\fP', and `\fBt\fP', or an octal digit\&. The first list of
characters specify which access rights are to be checked\&. If a `\fBu\fP\&'
is given, those for the owner of the file are used, if a `\fBg\fP\&' is
given, those of the group are checked, a `\fBo\fP\&' means to test those
of other users, and the `\fBa\fP\&' says to test all three groups\&. The
`\fB=\fP\&', `\fB+\fP', and `\fB\-\fP' again says how the modes are to be
checked and have the same meaning as described for the first form
above\&. The second list of characters finally says which access rights

Thus, `\fB*(f70?)\fP\&' gives the files for which the owner has read,
write, and execute permission, and for which other group members have
no rights, independent of the permissions for other users\&. The pattern
`\fB*(f\-100)\fP\&' gives all files for which the owner does not have
execute permission, and `\fB*(f:gu+w,o\-rx:)\fP\&' gives the files for which
the owner and the other members of the group have at least write
permission, and for which other users don\&'t have read or execute
permission\&.

.RS

In the first form, the first character after the `\fBe\fP\&'
will be used as a separator and anything up to the next matching separator
will be taken  as the \fIstring\fP; `\fB[\fP\&', `\fB{\fP', and `\fB<\fP' match
`\fB]\fP\&', `\fB}\fP', and `\fB>\fP', respectively, while any other character
matches itself\&. Note that expansions must be quoted in the \fIstring\fP
to prevent them from being expanded before globbing is done\&.
\fIstring\fP is then executed as shell code\&.  The string \fBglobqual\fP
is appended to the array \fBzsh_eval_context\fP the duration of
execution\&.
.PP
During the execution of \fIstring\fP the filename currently being tested is
available in the parameter \fBREPLY\fP; the parameter may be altered to
a string to be inserted into the list instead of the original
filename\&.  In addition, the parameter \fBreply\fP may be set to an array or a
string, which overrides the value of \fBREPLY\fP\&.  If set to an array, the
latter is inserted into the command line word by word\&.
.PP
For example, suppose a directory contains a single file `\fBlonely\fP\&'\&.  Then
the expression `\fB*(e:\&'reply=(${REPLY}{1,2})':)\fP' will cause the words
`\fBlonely1\fP\&' and `\fBlonely2\fP' to be inserted into the command line\&.  Note
the quoting of \fIstring\fP\&.

The form \fB+\fP\fIcmd\fP has the same effect, but no delimiters appear

If this flag is directly followed by a \fIsize specifier\fP `\fBk\fP\&' (`\fBK\fP'),
`\fBm\fP\&' (`\fBM\fP'), or `\fBp\fP' (`\fBP\fP') (e\&.g\&. `\fBLk\-50\fP') the check is
performed with kilobytes, megabytes, or blocks (of 512 bytes) instead\&.
(On some systems additional specifiers are available for gigabytes,
`\fBg\fP\&' or `\fBG\fP', and terabytes, `\fBt\fP' or `\fBT\fP'\&.) If a size specifier
is used a file is regarded as "exactly" the size if the file size rounded up
to the next unit is equal to the test size\&.  Hence `\fB*(Lm1)\fP\&'
matches files from 1 byte up to 1 Megabyte inclusive\&.  Note also that
the set of files "less than" the test size only includes files that would

\fBoe\fP and \fBo+\fP are special cases; they are each followed by shell code,

respectively (see above)\&.  The code is executed for each matched file with
the parameter \fBREPLY\fP set to the name of the file on entry and
\fBglobsort\fP appended to \fBzsh_eval_context\fP\&.  The code
should modify the parameter \fBREPLY\fP in some fashion\&.  On return, the
value of the parameter is used instead of the file name as the string on

expressions\&. As in parameter subscripting they may be negative to make

.TP
\fBP\fP\fIstring\fP
The \fIstring\fP will be prepended to each glob match as a separate
word\&.  \fIstring\fP is delimited in the same way as arguments to the
\fBe\fP glob qualifier described above\&.  The qualifier can be repeated;
the words are prepended separately so that the resulting command
line contains the words in the same order they were given in the
list of glob qualifiers\&.
.RS
.PP
A typical use for this is to prepend an option before all occurrences
of a file name; for example, the pattern `\fB*(P:\-f:)\fP\&' produces the
command line arguments `\fB\-f\fP \fIfile1\fP \fB\-f\fP \fIfile2\fP \&.\&.\&.\&'
.PP
If the modifier \fB^\fP is active, then \fIstring\fP will be appended
instead of prepended\&.  Prepending and appending is done independently
so both can be used on the same glob expression; for example by writing
`\fB*(P:foo:^P:bar:^P:baz:)\fP\&' which produces the command line arguments
`\fBfoo\fP \fBbaz\fP \fIfile1\fP \fBbar\fP \&.\&.\&.\&'

More than one of these lists can be combined, separated by commas\&. The
whole list matches if at least one of the sublists matches (they are

however, affect all matches generated, independent of the sublist in
which they are given\&.  These are the qualifiers `\fBM\fP\&', `\fBT\fP',
`\fBN\fP\&', `\fBD\fP', `\fBn\fP', `\fBo\fP', `\fBO\fP' and the subscripts given
in brackets (`\fB[\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB]\fP\&')\&.
.PP
If a `\fB:\fP\&' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the expression in
parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see the section `Modifiers\&'
in the section `History Expansion\&')\&.  Each modifier must be introduced by a
separate `\fB:\fP\&'\&.  Note also that the result after modification does not
have to be an existing file\&.  The name of any existing file can be followed
by a modifier of the form `\fB(:\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP\&'
even if no actual filename generation
is performed, although note that the presence of the parentheses
causes the entire expression to be subjected to any global pattern matching
