=head1 NOTES

=head2 .proverc

If F<~/.proverc> or F<./.proverc> exist they will be read and any
options they contain processed before the command line options. Options
in F<.proverc> are specified in the same way as command line options:

    # .proverc
    --state=hot,fast,save
    -j9

Additional option files may be specified with the C<--rc> option.
Default option file processing is disabled by the C<--norc> option.

Under Windows and VMS the option file is named F<_proverc> rather than
F<.proverc> and is sought only in the current directory.

=head2 Reading from C<STDIN>

If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '-':

 prove - < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt

See the C<README> in the C<examples> directory of this distribution.

=head2 Default Test Directory

If no files or directories are supplied, C<prove> looks for all files
matching the pattern C<t/*.t>.

=head2 Colored Test Output

Colored test output using L<TAP::Formatter::Color> is the default, but
if output is not to a terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by
adding the C<--color> switch.

Color support requires L<Term::ANSIColor> and, on windows platforms, also
L<Win32::Console::ANSI>. If the necessary module(s) are not installed
colored output will not be available.

=head2 Exit Code

If the tests fail C<prove> will exit with non-zero status.

=head2 Arguments to Tests

It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with the arisdottle, '::'. For example

 prove -v t/mytest.t :: --url http://example.com

would run F<t/mytest.t> with the options '--url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.

=head2 C<--exec>

Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the C<-e>, or C<--exec>
switch:

 prove --exec '/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
 prove --exec '/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
 prove --exec '/path/to/my/customer/exec'

=head2 C<--merge>

If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the C<--merge> option to
merge the test scripts' STDERR into their STDOUT.

This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results appear) and STDERR
(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on STDERR.

Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on STDERR looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.

=head2 C<--trap>

The C<--trap> option will attempt to trap SIGINT (Ctrl-C) during a test
run and display the test summary even if the run is interrupted

=head2 C<--state>

You can ask C<prove> to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run based on that saved state.

The C<--state> switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.

=over

=item C<last>

Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.

    # Run all tests in random order
    $ prove -b --state=save --shuffle

    # Run them again in the same order
    $ prove -b --state=last

=item C<failed>

Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

    # Run all tests
    $ prove -b --state=save

    # Run failures
    $ prove -b --state=failed

If you also specify the C<save> option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.

    # Repeat until no more failures
    $ prove -b --state=failed,save

=item C<passed>

Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.

=item C<all>

Run all tests in normal order. Multiple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:

    $ prove -b --state=failed,all,save

=item C<hot>

Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The C<hot> option causes tests to be run in most-recent-
failure order.

    $ prove -b --state=hot,save

Tests that have never failed will not be selected. To run all tests with
the most recently failed first use

    $ prove -b --state=hot,all,save

This combination of options may also be specified thus

    $ prove -b --state=adrian

=item C<todo>

Run any tests with todos.

=item C<slow>

Run the tests in slowest to fastest order. This is useful in conjunction
with the C<-j> parallel testing switch to ensure that your slowest tests
start running first.

    $ prove -b --state=slow -j9

=item C<fast>

Run test tests in fastest to slowest order.

=item C<new>

Run the tests in newest to oldest order based on the modification times
of the test scripts.

=item C<old>

Run the tests in oldest to newest order.

=item C<fresh>

Run those test scripts that have been modified since the last test run.

=item C<save>

Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called F<.prove>
(F<_prove> on Windows and VMS) in the current directory.

=back

The C<--state> switch may be used more than once.

    $ prove -b --state=hot --state=all,save

=head2 --rules

The C<--rules> option is used to control which tests are run sequentially and
which are run in parallel, if the C<--jobs> option is specified. The option may
be specified multiple times, and the order matters.

The most practical use is likely to specify that some tests are not
"parallel-ready".  Since mentioning a file with --rules doesn't cause it to
be selected to run as a test, you can "set and forget" some rules preferences in
your .proverc file. Then you'll be able to take maximum advantage of the
performance benefits of parallel testing, while some exceptions are still run
in parallel.

=head3 --rules examples

    # All tests are allowed to run in parallel, except those starting with "p"
    --rules='seq=t/p*.t' --rules='par=**'

    # All tests must run in sequence except those starting with "p", which should be run parallel
    --rules='par=t/p*.t'

=head3 --rules resolution

=over 4

=item * By default, all tests are eligible to be run in parallel. Specifying any of your own rules removes this one.

=item * "First match wins". The first rule that matches a test will be the one that applies.

=item * Any test which does not match a rule will be run in sequence at the end of the run.

=item * The existence of a rule does not imply selecting a test. You must still specify the tests to run.

=item * Specifying a rule to allow tests to run in parallel does not make them run in parallel. You still need specify the number of parallel C<jobs> in your Harness object.

=back

=head3 --rules Glob-style pattern matching

We implement our own glob-style pattern matching for --rules. Here are the
supported patterns:

    ** is any number of characters, including /, within a pathname
    * is zero or more characters within a filename/directory name
    ? is exactly one character within a filename/directory name
    {foo,bar,baz} is any of foo, bar or baz.
    \ is an escape character

=head3 More advanced specifications for parallel vs sequence run rules

If you need more advanced management of what runs in parallel vs in sequence, see
the associated 'rules' documentation in L<TAP::Harness> and L<TAP::Parser::Scheduler>.
If what's possible directly through C<prove> is not sufficient, you can write your own
harness to access these features directly.

=head2 @INC

prove introduces a separation between "options passed to the perl which
runs prove" and "options passed to the perl which runs tests"; this
distinction is by design. Thus the perl which is running a test starts
with the default C<@INC>. Additional library directories can be added
via the C<PERL5LIB> environment variable, via -Ifoo in C<PERL5OPT> or
via the C<-Ilib> option to F<prove>.

=head2 Taint Mode

Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
C<PERL5LIB> environment variable do not appear in C<@INC>.

Because C<PERL5LIB> is often used during testing to add build
directories to C<@INC> prove passes the names of any directories found
in C<PERL5LIB> as -I switches. The net effect of this is that
C<PERL5LIB> is honoured even when prove is run in taint mode.


=head1 FORMATTERS

You can load a custom L<TAP::Parser::Formatter>:

  prove --formatter MyFormatter

=head1 SOURCE HANDLERS

You can load custom L<TAP::Parser::SourceHandler>s, to change the way the
parser interprets particular I<sources> of TAP.

  prove --source MyHandler --source YetAnother t

If you want to provide config to the source you can use:

  prove --source MyCustom \
        --source Perl --perl-option 'foo=bar baz' --perl-option avg=0.278 \
        --source File --file-option extensions=.txt --file-option extensions=.tmp t
        --source pgTAP --pgtap-option pset=format=html --pgtap-option pset=border=2

Each C<--$source-option> option must specify a key/value pair separated by an
C<=>. If an option can take multiple values, just specify it multiple times,
as with the C<extensions=> examples above. If the option should be a hash
reference, specify the value as a second pair separated by a C<=>, as in the
C<pset=> examples above (escape C<=> with a backslash).

All C<--sources> are combined into a hash, and passed to L<TAP::Harness/new>'s
C<sources> parameter.

See L<TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory> for more details on how configuration is
passed to I<SourceHandlers>.

=head1 PLUGINS

Plugins can be loaded using the C<< -PI<plugin> >> syntax, eg:

  prove -PMyPlugin

This will search for a module named C<App::Prove::Plugin::MyPlugin>, or failing
that, C<MyPlugin>.  If the plugin can't be found, C<prove> will complain & exit.

You can pass arguments to your plugin by appending C<=arg1,arg2,etc> to the
plugin name:

  prove -PMyPlugin=fou,du,fafa

Please check individual plugin documentation for more details.

=head2 Available Plugins

For an up-to-date list of plugins available, please check CPAN:
