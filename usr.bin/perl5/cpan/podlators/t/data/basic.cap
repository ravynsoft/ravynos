    basic.pod - Test of various basic POD features in translators.

[1mHEADINGS[m
    Try a few different levels of headings, with embedded formatting codes and
    other interesting bits.

[1mThis "is" a "level 1" heading[m
  [1m``Level'' "2 [4mheading[m[m
   Level 3 [1mheading [4mwith "weird stuff "" (double quote)"[m[m
   Level "4 "heading"
    Now try again with [1mintermixed[m text.

[1mThis "is" a "level 1" heading[m
    Text.

  [1m``Level'' 2 [4mheading[m[m
    Text.

   Level 3 [1mheading [4mwith "weird stuff"[m[m
    Text.

   Level "4 "heading"
    Text.

[1mLINKS[m
    These are all taken from the Pod::Parser tests.

    Try out [4mLOTS[m of different ways of specifying references:

    Reference the "section" in manpage

    Reference the "section" in "manpage"

    Reference the "section" in manpage

    Now try it using the new "|" stuff ...

    Reference the thistext|

    Reference the thistext |

    Reference the thistext|

    Reference the thistext |

    Reference the thistext|

    Reference the thistext|

    And then throw in a few new ones of my own.

    foo

    foo

    "bar" in foo

    "baz boo" in foo

    "bar"

    "baz boo"

    "baz boo"

    "baz boo" in foo bar

    "boo var baz"

    "bar baz"

    "boo", "bar", and "baz"

    foobar

    Testing [4mitalics[m

    "[4mItalic[m text" in foo

    "Section "with" [4m[1mother[m markup[m" in foo|bar

[1mOVER AND ITEMS[m
    Taken from Pod::Parser tests, this is a test to ensure that multiline
    =item paragraphs get indented appropriately.

    This is a test.

    There should be whitespace now before this line.

    Taken from Pod::Parser tests, this is a test to ensure the nested =item
    paragraphs get indented appropriately.

    1 First section.

      a this is item a

      b this is item b

    2 Second section.

      a this is item a

      b this is item b

      c
      d This is item c & d.

    Now some additional weirdness of our own. Make sure that multiple tags for
    one paragraph are properly compacted.

    "foo"
    [1mbar[m
    "baz"
        There shouldn't be any spaces between any of these item tags; this
        idiom is used in perlfunc.

    Some longer item text
        Just to make sure that we test paragraphs where the item text doesn't
        fit in the margin of the paragraph (and make sure that this paragraph
        fills a few lines).

        Let's also make it multiple paragraphs to be sure that works.

    Test use of =over without =item as a block "quote" or block paragraph.

        This should be indented four spaces but otherwise formatted the same
        as any other regular text paragraph. Make sure it's long enough to see
        the results of the formatting.....

    Now try the same thing nested, and make sure that the indentation is reset
    back properly.

            This paragraph should be doubly indented.

        This paragraph should only be singly indented.

        *   This is an item in the middle of a block-quote, which should be
            allowed.

        *   We're also testing tagless item commands.

        Should be back to the single level of indentation.

    Should be back to regular indentation.

    Now also check the transformation of * into real bullets for man pages.

    *   An item. We're also testing using =over without a number, and making
        sure that item text wraps properly.

    *   Another item.

    and now test the numbering of item blocks.

    1.  First item.

    2.  Second item.

[1mFORMATTING CODES[m
    Another test taken from Pod::Parser.

    This is a test to see if I can do not only $self and method(), but also
    "$self->method()" and "$self->{FIELDNAME}" and "$Foo <=> $Bar" without
    resorting to escape sequences. If I want to refer to the right-shift
    operator I can do something like "$x >> 3" or even "$y >> 5".

    Now for the grand finale of "$self->method()->{FIELDNAME} = {FOO=>BAR}".
    And I also want to make sure that newlines work like this "$self->{FOOBAR}
    >> 3 and [$b => $a]->[$a <=> $b]"

    Of course I should still be able to do all this [4mwith[m escape sequences too:
    "$self->method()" and "$self->{FIELDNAME}" and "{FOO=>BAR}".

    Don't forget "$self->method()->{FIELDNAME} = {FOO=>BAR}".

    And make sure that 0 works too!

    Now, if I use << or >> as my delimiters, then I have to use whitespace. So
    things like "<$self-"method()>> and "<$self-"{FIELDNAME}>> won't end up
    doing what you might expect since the first > will still terminate the
    first < seen.

    Lets make sure these work for empty ones too, like "" and ">>" (just to be
    obnoxious)

    The statement: "This is dog kind's [4mfinest[m hour!" is a parody of a
    quotation from Winston Churchill.

    The following tests are added to those:

    Make sure that a few other odd [4mthings[m still work. This should be a
    vertical bar: |. Here's a test of a few more special escapes that have to
    be supported:

    &  An ampersand.

    '  An apostrophe.

    <  A less-than sign.

    >  A greater-than sign.

    "  A double quotation mark.

    /  A forward slash.

    Try to get this bit of text over towards the edge so
    |that all of this text inside S<> won't| be wrapped. Also test the
    |same thing with non-breaking spaces.|

    There is a soft hyphen in hyphen at hy-phen.

    This is a test of an index entry.

[1mVERBATIM[m
    Throw in a few verbatim paragraphs.

        use Term::ANSIColor;
        print color 'bold blue';
        print "This text is bold blue.\n";
        print color 'reset';
        print "This text is normal.\n";
        print colored ("Yellow on magenta.\n", 'yellow on_magenta');
        print "This text is normal.\n";
        print colored ['yellow on_magenta'], "Yellow on magenta.\n";

        use Term::ANSIColor qw(uncolor);
        print uncolor '01;31', "\n";

    But this isn't verbatim (make sure it wraps properly), and the next
    paragraph is again:

        use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants);
        print BOLD, BLUE, "This text is in bold blue.\n", RESET;

        use Term::ANSIColor qw(:constants); $Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET = 1; print BOLD BLUE "This text is in bold blue.\n"; print "This text is normal.\n";

    (Ugh, that's obnoxiously long.) Try different spacing:

            Starting with a tab.
    Not
    starting
    with
    a
    tab.  But this should still be verbatim.
     As should this.

    This isn't.

     This is.  And this:    is an internal tab.  It should be:
                        |--| <= lined up with that.

    (Tricky, but tabs should be expanded before the translator starts in on
    the text since otherwise text with mixed tabs and spaces will get messed
    up.)

        And now we test verbatim paragraphs right before a heading.  Older
        versions of Pod::Man generated two spaces between paragraphs like this
        and the heading.  (In order to properly test this, one may have to
        visually inspect the nroff output when run on the generated *roff
        text, unfortunately.)
