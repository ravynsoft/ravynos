=head1 GETTING HELP

The F<perldoc> program gives you access to all the documentation that comes
with Perl.  You can get more documentation, tutorials and community support
online at L<https://www.perl.org/>.

If you're new to Perl, you should start by running C<perldoc perlintro>,
which is a general intro for beginners and provides some background to help
you navigate the rest of Perl's extensive documentation.  Run C<perldoc
perldoc> to learn more things you can do with F<perldoc>.

For ease of access, the Perl manual has been split up into several sections.

On a Unix-like system, these documentation files will usually also be
available as manpages for use with the F<man> program.

Some documentation is not available as man pages, so if a
cross-reference is not found by man, try it with L<perldoc>.  Perldoc can
also take you directly to documentation for functions (with the B<-f>
switch). See S<C<perldoc --help>> (or S<C<perldoc perldoc>> or
S<C<man perldoc>>) for other helpful options L<perldoc> has to offer.

In general, if something strange has gone wrong with your program and you're
not sure where you should look for help, try making your code comply with
B<use strict> and B<use warnings>.  These will often point out exactly
where the trouble is.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl officially stands for Practical Extraction and Report Language,
except when it doesn't.

Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary
text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing
reports based on that information.  It quickly became a good language
for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has grown into
a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything
from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application development.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).  It combines
(in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best features of B<sed>,
B<awk>, and B<sh>, making it familiar and easy to use for Unix users to
whip up quick solutions to annoying problems.  Its general-purpose
programming facilities support procedural, functional, and
object-oriented programming paradigms, making Perl a comfortable
language for the long haul on major projects, whatever your bent.

Perl's roots in text processing haven't been forgotten over the years.
It still boasts some of the most powerful regular expressions to be
found anywhere, and its support for Unicode text is world-class.  It
handles all kinds of structured text, too, through an extensive
collection of extensions.  Those libraries, collected in the CPAN,
provide ready-made solutions to an astounding array of problems.  When
they haven't set the standard themselves, they steal from the best
-- just like Perl itself.

=head1 AVAILABILITY

Perl is available for most operating systems, including virtually
all Unix-like platforms.  See L<perlport/"Supported Platforms">
for a listing.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

See L<perlrun/ENVIRONMENT>.

 "@INC"			locations of perl libraries

"@INC" above is a reference to the built-in variable of the same name;
see L<perlvar> for more information.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Using the C<use strict> pragma ensures that all variables are properly
declared and prevents other misuses of legacy Perl features.
These are enabled by default within the scope of
C<L<use v5.12|perlfunc/use VERSION>> (or higher).

The C<use warnings> pragma produces some lovely diagnostics.
It is enabled by default when you say C<use v5.35> (or higher).
One can also use the B<-w> flag, but its use is normally discouraged,
because it gets applied to all executed Perl code, including that not under
your control.

See L<perldiag> for explanations of all Perl's diagnostics.  The C<use
diagnostics> pragma automatically turns Perl's normally terse warnings
and errors into these longer forms.

Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the error, with an
indication of the next token or token type that was to be examined.
(In a script passed to Perl via B<-e> switches, each
B<-e> is counted as one line.)

Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can produce error
messages such as "Insecure dependency".  See L<perlsec>.

Did we mention that you should definitely consider using the B<use warnings>
pragma?

=head1 BUGS

The behavior implied by the B<use warnings> pragma is not mandatory.

Perl is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of various
operations such as type casting, atof(), and floating-point
output with sprintf().

If your stdio requires a seek or eof between reads and writes on a
particular stream, so does Perl.  (This doesn't apply to sysread()
and syswrite().)

While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary size limits
(apart from memory size), there are still a few arbitrary limits:  a
given variable name may not be longer than 251 characters.  Line numbers
displayed by diagnostics are internally stored as short integers,
so they are limited to a maximum of 65535 (higher numbers usually being
affected by wraparound).

You may submit your bug reports (be sure to include full configuration
information as output by the myconfig program in the perl source
tree, or by C<perl -V>) to L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>.

Perl actually stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister, but
don't tell anyone I said that.

=head1 NOTES

The Perl motto is "There's more than one way to do it."  Divining
how many more is left as an exercise to the reader.

The three principal virtues of a programmer are Laziness,
Impatience, and Hubris.  See the Camel Book for why.
