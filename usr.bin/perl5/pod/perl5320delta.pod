=head1 NAME

perl5320delta - what is new for perl v5.32.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the 5.32.0
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read
L<perl5300delta>, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.30.0.

=head1 Core Enhancements

=head2 The isa Operator

A new experimental infix operator called C<isa> tests whether a given object
is an instance of a given class or a class derived from it:

    if( $obj isa Package::Name ) { ... }

For more detail see L<perlop/Class Instance Operator>.

=head2 Unicode 13.0 is supported

See L<https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/> for details.

=head2 Chained comparisons capability

Some comparison operators, as their associativity, I<chain> with some
operators of the same precedence (but never with operators of different
precedence).

    if ( $x < $y <= $z ) {...}

behaves exactly like:

    if ( $x < $y && $y <= $z ) {...}

(assuming that C<"$y"> is as simple a scalar as it looks.)

You can read more about this in L<perlop> under
L<perlop/Operator Precedence and Associativity>.

=head2 New Unicode properties C<Identifier_Status> and C<Identifier_Type> supported

Unicode has revised its regular expression requirements:
L<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr18/tr18-21.html>.
As part of that they are wanting more properties to be exposed, ones
that aren't part of the strict UCD (Unicode character database). These
two are used for examining inputs for security purposes. Details on
their usage is at L<https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr39/>.

=head2 It is now possible to write C<qr/\p{Name=...}/>, or
C<qr!\p{na=/(SMILING|GRINNING) FACE/}!>

The Unicode Name property is now accessible in regular expression
patterns, as an alternative to C<\N{...}>.
A comparison of the two methods is given in
L<perlunicode/Comparison of \N{...} and \p{name=...}>.

The second example above shows that wildcard subpatterns are also usable
in this property. See L<perlunicode/Wildcards in Property Values>.

=head2 Improvement of C<POSIX::mblen()>, C<mbtowc>, and C<wctomb>

The C<POSIX::mblen()>, C<mbtowc>, and C<wctomb> functions now
work on shift state locales and are thread-safe on C99 and above
compilers when executed on a platform that has locale thread-safety; the
length parameters are now optional.

These functions are always executed under the current C language locale.
(See L<perllocale>.)  Most locales are stateless, but a few, notably the
very rarely encountered ISO 2022, maintain a state between calls to
these functions. Previously the state was cleared on every call, but
now the state is not reset unless the appropriate parameter is C<undef>.

On threaded perls, the C99 functions L<mbrlen(3)>, L<mbrtowc(3)>, and
L<wcrtomb(3)>, when available, are substituted for the plain functions.
This makes these functions thread-safe when executing on a locale
thread-safe platform.

The string length parameters in C<mblen> and C<mbtowc> are now optional;
useful only if you wish to restrict the length parsed in the source
string to less than the actual length.

=head2 Alpha assertions are no longer experimental

See L<perlre/(*pla:pattern)>, L<perlre/(*plb:pattern)>,
L<perlre/(*nla:pattern)>>, and L<perlre/(*nlb:pattern)>.
Use of these no longer generates a warning; existing code that disables
the warning category C<experimental::alpha_assertions> will continue to work
without any changes needed. Enabling the category has no effect.

=head2 Script runs are no longer experimental

See L<perlre/Script Runs>. Use of these no longer generates a warning;
existing code that disables the warning category
C<experimental::script_run> will continue to work without any
changes needed. Enabling the category has no effect.

=head2 Feature checks are now faster

Previously feature checks in the parser required a hash lookup when
features were set outside of a feature bundle, this has been optimized
to a bit mask check. [L<GH #17229|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17229>]

=head2 Perl is now developed on GitHub

Perl is now developed on GitHub. You can find us at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5>.

Non-security bugs should now be reported via GitHub. Security issues should
continue to be reported as documented in L<perlsec>.

=head2 Compiled patterns can now be dumped before optimization

This is primarily useful for tracking down bugs in the regular
expression compiler. This dump happens on C<-DDEBUGGING> perls, if you
specify C<-Drv> on the command line; or on any perl if the pattern is
compiled within the scope of S<C<use re qw(Debug DUMP_PRE_OPTIMIZE)>> or
S<C<use re qw(Debug COMPILE EXTRA)>>. (All but the second case display
other information as well.)

=head1 Security

=head2 [CVE-2020-10543] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression

A signed C<size_t> integer overflow in the storage space calculations for
nested regular expression quantifiers could cause a heap buffer overflow in
Perl's regular expression compiler that overwrites memory allocated after the
regular expression storage space with attacker supplied data.

The target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate partial
expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the overflow occurring.  This
requirement is unlikely to be met on 64-bit systems.

Discovered by: ManhND of The Tarantula Team, VinCSS (a member of Vingroup).

=head2 [CVE-2020-10878] Integer overflow via malformed bytecode produced by a crafted regular expression

Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between instructions for the
regular expression engine could cause corruption of the intermediate language
state of a compiled regular expression.  An attacker could abuse this behaviour
to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression.

Discovered by: Hugo van der Sanden and Slaven Rezic.

=head2 [CVE-2020-12723] Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression

Recursive calls to C<S_study_chunk()> by Perl's regular expression compiler to
optimize the intermediate language representation of a regular expression could
cause corruption of the intermediate language state of a compiled regular
expression.

Discovered by: Sergey Aleynikov.

=head2 Additional Note

An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of the above
flaws if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker.  Evaluating
regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular
expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this
usage scenario.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

=head2 Certain pattern matching features are now prohibited in compiling
Unicode property value wildcard subpatterns

These few features are either inappropriate or interfere with the
algorithm used to accomplish this task. The complete list is in
L<perlunicode/Wildcards in Property Values>.

=head2 Unused functions C<POSIX::mbstowcs> and C<POSIX::wcstombs> are removed

These functions could never have worked due to a defective interface
specification. There is clearly no demand for them, given that no one
has ever complained in the many years the functions were claimed to be
available, hence so-called "support" for them is now dropped.

=head2 A bug fix for C<(?[...])> may have caused some patterns to no
longer compile

See L</Selected Bug Fixes>. The heuristics previously used may have let
some constructs compile (perhaps not with the programmer's intended
effect) that should have been errors. None are known, but it is
possible that some erroneous constructs no longer compile.

=head2 C<\p{I<user-defined>}> properties now always override official
Unicode ones

Previously, if and only if a user-defined property was declared prior to
the compilation of the regular expression pattern that contains it, its
definition was used instead of any official Unicode property with the
same name. Now, it always overrides the official property. This
change could break existing code that relied (likely unwittingly) on the
previous behavior. Without this fix, if Unicode released a new version
with a new property that happens to have the same name as the one you
had long been using, your program would break when you upgraded to a
perl that used that new Unicode version. See L<perlunicode/User-Defined
Character Properties>. [L<GH #17205|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17205>]

=head2 Modifiable variables are no longer permitted in constants

Code like:

    my $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var };

where C<$var> is referenced elsewhere in some sort of modifiable context now
produces an exception when the sub is defined.

This error can be avoided by adding a return to the sub definition:

    $sub = sub () { return $var };

This has been deprecated since Perl 5.22.
L<[GH #17020]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17020>

=head2 Use of L<C<vec>|perlfunc/vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS> on strings with code points above 0xFF is forbidden

Such strings are represented internally in UTF-8, and C<vec> is a
bit-oriented operation that will likely give unexpected results on those
strings. This was deprecated in perl 5.28.0.

=head2 Use of code points over 0xFF in string bitwise operators

Some uses of these were already illegal after a previous deprecation
cycle. The remaining uses are now prohibited, having been deprecated in perl
5.28.0. See L<perldeprecation>.

=head2 C<Sys::Hostname::hostname()> does not accept arguments

This usage was deprecated in perl 5.28.0 and is now fatal.

=head2 Plain "0" string now treated as a number for range operator

Previously a range C<"0" .. "-1"> would produce a range of numeric
strings from "0" through "99"; this now produces an empty list, just
as C<0 .. -1> does. This also means that C<"0" .. "9"> now produces a
list of integers, where previously it would produce a list of strings.

This was due to a special case that treated strings starting with "0"
as strings so ranges like C<"00" .. "03"> produced C<"00", "01", "02", "03">,
but didn't specially handle the string C<"0">.
L<[GH #16770]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16770>

=head2 C<\K> now disallowed in look-ahead and look-behind assertions

This was disallowed because it causes unexpected behaviour, and no-one
could define what the desired behaviour should be.

L<Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable|perldiag/"Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable">

This is actually not a new message, but it is now output when the
warnings category C<portable> is enabled.

When raised during regular expression pattern compilation, the warning
has extra text added at the end marking where precisely in the pattern
it occurred.

=item *

L<Non-hex character '%c' terminates \x early.  Resolved as "%s"|perldiag/"Non-hex character '%c' terminates \x early.  Resolved as "%s"">

This replaces a warning that was much less specific, and which gave
false information. This new warning parallels the similar
already-existing one raised for C<\o{}>.

the text of the resolution has been clarified.

=item *

L<'%s' resolved to '\o{%s}%d'|perldiag/'%s' resolved to '\o{%s}%d'>

As of Perl 5.32, this message is no longer generated. Instead,
L<perldiag/Non-octal character '%c' terminates \o early.  Resolved as "%s">
is used instead.

=item *

L<Use of code point 0x%s is not allowed; the permissible max is 0x%X|perldiag/"Use of code point 0x%s is not allowed; the permissible max is 0x%X">

Some instances of this message previously output the hex digits C<A>,
C<B>, C<C>, C<D>, C<E>, and C<F> in lower case. Now they are all
consistently upper case.

The following three diagnostics have been removed, and replaced by
L<C<Expecting interpolated extended charclass in regex; marked by <-- HERE in mE<sol>%sE<sol>>

C<Expecting '(?flags:(?[...' in regex; marked by S<<-- HERE> in mE<sol>%sE<sol>>.

=item *

The C<Code point 0x%X is not Unicode, and not portable> warning removed
the line C<Code points above 0xFFFF_FFFF require larger than a 32 bit word.>
as code points that large are no longer legal on 32-bit platforms.

=item *

L<Can't use global %s in %s|perldiag/"Can't use global %s in %s">

This error message has been slightly reformatted from the original C<Can't use
global %s in "%s">, and in particular misleading error messages like C<Can't
use global $_ in "my"> are now rendered as C<Can't use global $_ in subroutine
signature>.

=item *

L<Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are no longer permitted|perldiag/"Constants from lexical variables potentially modified elsewhere are no longer permitted">

This error message replaces the former C<Constants from lexical variables
potentially modified elsewhere are deprecated. This will not be allowed in Perl
5.32> to reflect the fact that this previously deprecated usage has now been
transformed into an exception. The message's classification has also been
updated from D (deprecated) to F (fatal).

See also L</Incompatible Changes>.

=item *

C<\N{} here is restricted to one character> is now emitted in the same
circumstances where previously C<\N{} in inverted character class or as a range
end-point is restricted to one character> was.

This is due to new circumstances having been added in Perl 5.30 that weren't

=item *

Use a compile and run test for C<lchown> to satisfy clang++ which should
more reliably detect it.

=item *

For C++ compilers, add C<< #include <stdio.h> >> to Configure's probes for
C<getpgrp> and C<setpgrp> as they use printf and C++ compilers may fail
compilation instead of just warning.

=item *

Check if the compiler can handle inline attribute.

F<Configure> now correctly handles gcc-10. Previously it was interpreting it
as gcc-1 and turned on C<-fpcc-struct-return>.

Perl now no longer probes for C<d_u32align>, defaulting to C<define> on all
platforms. This check was error-prone when it was done, which was on 32-bit
platforms only.

The C<ECHO> macro is now defined. This is used in a C<dtrace> rule that was
originally changed for FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make apparently predefines it.
The Solaris make does not predefine C<ECHO> which broke this rule on Solaris.

=item z/OS

Perl 5.32 has been tested on z/OS 2.4, with the following caveats:

=over 4

=item *

Only static builds (the default) build reliably

=item *

When using locales, z/OS does not handle the C<LC_MESSAGES> category
properly, so when compiling perl, you should add the following to your
F<Configure> options

 ./Configure <other options> -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE_MESSAGES

=item *

z/OS does not support locales with threads, so when compiling a threaded
perl, you should add the following to your F<Configure> options

 ./Configure <other Configure options> -Accflags=-DNO_LOCALE

=item *

Some CPAN modules that are shipped with perl fail at least one of their
self-tests.  These are:
Archive::Tar,
Config::Perl::V,
CPAN::Meta,
CPAN::Meta::YAML,
Digest::MD5,
Digest::SHA,
Encode,
ExtUtils::MakeMaker,
ExtUtils::Manifest,
HTTP::Tiny,
IO::Compress,

JSON::PP,
libnet,
MIME::Base64,
Module::Metadata,
PerlIO::via-QuotedPrint,
Pod::Checker,
podlators,
Pod::Simple,
Socket,
and Test::Harness.

The causes of the failures range from the self-test itself is flawed,
and the module actually works fine, up to the module doesn't work at all
on EBCDIC platforms.

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

C<savepvn>'s len parameter is now a C<Size_t> instead of an C<I32> since we
can handle longer strings than 31 bits.

=item *

The lexer (C<Perl_yylex()> in F<toke.c>) was previously a single 4100-line
function, relying heavily on C<goto> and a lot of widely-scoped local variables
to do its work. It has now been pulled apart into a few dozen smaller static
functions; the largest remaining chunk (C<yyl_word_or_keyword()>) is a little
over 900 lines, and consists of a single C<switch> statement, all of whose
C<case> groups are independent. This should be much easier to understand and
maintain.

=item *

The OS-level signal handlers and type (Sighandler_t) used by the perl core
were declared as having three parameters, but the OS was always told to
call them with one argument. This has been fixed by declaring them to have
one parameter. See the merge commit C<v5.31.5-346-g116e19abbf> for full
details.

=item *

The code that handles C<tr///> has been extensively revised, fixing
various bugs, especially when the source and/or replacement strings
contain characters whose code points are above 255. Some of the bugs
were undocumented, one being that under some circumstances (but not all)
with C</s>, the squeezing was done based on the source, rather than the
replacement. A documented bug that got fixed was
L<[GH #14777]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14777>.

=item *

A new macro for XS writers dealing with UTF-8-encoded Unicode strings
has been created L<perlapi/C<UTF8_CHK_SKIP>> that is safer in the face
of malformed UTF-8 input than L<perlapi/C<UTF8_SKIP>> (but not as safe
as L<perlapi/C<UTF8_SAFE_SKIP>>). It won't read past a NUL character.
It has been backported in L<Devel::PPPort> 3.55 and later.

=item *

Added the C<< PL_curstackinfo->si_cxsubix >> field. This records the stack index
of the most recently pushed sub/format/eval context. It is set and restored
automatically by C<cx_pushsub()>, C<cx_popsub()> etc., but would need to be
manually managed if you do any unusual manipulation of the context stack.

=item *

Various macros dealing with character type classification and changing case
where the input is encoded in UTF-8 now require an extra parameter to prevent
potential reads beyond the end of the buffer. Use of these has generated a
deprecation warning since Perl 5.26. Details are in
L<perldeprecation/In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.>

=item *

A new parser function L<parse_subsignature()|perlapi/parse_subsignature>
allows a keyword plugin to parse a subroutine signature while C<use feature
'signatures'> is in effect. This allows custom keywords to implement
semantics similar to regular C<sub> declarations that include signatures.
L<[GH #16261]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/16261>

=item *

Since on some platforms we need to hold a mutex when temporarily
switching locales, new macros (C<STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED_IN>,
C<WITH_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED> and C<WITH_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED_IN>)
have been added to make it easier to do this safely and efficiently
as part of L<[GH #17034]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17034>.

=item *

The memory bookkeeping overhead for allocating an OP structure has been
reduced by 8 bytes per OP on 64-bit systems.

=item *

L<eval_pv()|perlapi/eval_pv> no longer stringifies the exception when
C<[GH #17035]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17035>]

=item *

The PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL environment variable was formerly only honoured on perl
binaries built with DEBUGGING support. It is now checked on all perl builds.
Its normal use is to force perl to individually free every block of memory
which it has allocated before exiting, which is useful when using automated
leak detection tools such as valgrind.

=item *

The API eval_sv() now accepts a C<G_RETHROW> flag. If this flag is set and an
exception is thrown while compiling or executing the supplied code, it will be
rethrown, and eval_sv() will not return.
L<[GH #17036]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17036>

=item *

As part of the fix for
L<[GH #1537]|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/1537> perl_parse()
now returns non-zero if exit(0) is called in a C<BEGIN>, C<UNITCHECK> or
C<CHECK> block.

=item *

Most functions which recursively walked an op tree during compilation have been
made non-recursive. This avoids SEGVs from stack overflow when the op tree is
deeply nested, such as C<$n == 1 ? "one" : $n == 2 ? "two" : ....> (especially
in code which is auto-generated).

This is particularly noticeable where the code is compiled within a separate
thread, as threads tend to have small stacks by default.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Previously L<perlfunc/require> would only treat the special built-in
SV C<&PL_sv_undef> as a value in C<%INC> as if a previous C<require>
has failed, treating other undefined SVs as if the previous C<require>
has succeeded. This could cause unexpected success from C<require>
e.g., on C<local %INC = %INC;>. This has been fixed. [L<GH #17428|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17428>]

C<(?{...})> eval groups in regular expressions no longer unintentionally
trigger "EVAL without pos change exceeded limit in regex" [L<GH #17490|https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/17490>].

C<(?[...])> extended bracketed character classes do not wrongly raise an
error on some cases where a previously-compiled such class is
interpolated into another. The heuristics previously used have been
replaced by a reliable method, and hence the diagnostics generated have
changed. See L</Diagnostics>.

A spurious C<)> in a subparse, such as in C<s/.../code here/e> or
C<"...${code here}">, no longer confuses the parser.

Previously a subparse was bracketed with generated C<(> and C<)>
tokens, so a spurious C<)> would close the construct without doing the
normal subparse clean up, confusing the parser and possible causing an

Parsing incomplete hex or binary literals was changed in 5.31.1 to treat such a

incomplete hex or binary literals produce a fatal error.

=head1 Obituary

Jeff Goff (JGOFF or DrForr), an integral part of the Perl and Raku
communities and a dear friend to all of us, has passed away on March
13th, 2020. DrForr was a prominent member of the communities, attending
and speaking at countless events, contributing to numerous projects,
and assisting and helping in any way he could.

His passing leaves a hole in our hearts and in our communities and he
will be sorely missed.

The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is automatically
generated from version control history. In particular, it does not include
the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who reported issues to
the Perl bug tracker.

Many of the changes included in this version originated in the CPAN modules
included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN community for
helping Perl to flourish.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
L<https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues>. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a public issue tracker, then see
