C<hash> is a precomputed hash of the key string, or zero if it has not been
precomputed.  This parameter is omitted from the C<pvs> form, as it is computed

The only flag currently used from the C<flags> parameter is C<COPHH_KEY_UTF8>.
It is illegal to set this in the C<sv> form.  In the C<pv*> forms, it specifies
whether the key octets are interpreted as UTF-8 (if set) or as Latin-1 (if
cleared).  The C<sv> form uses the underlying SV to determine the UTF-8ness of
the octets.
