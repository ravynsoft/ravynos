=for apidoc_section $SV_flags

=for apidoc Ay||svtype
An enum of flags for Perl types.  These are found in the file F<sv.h>
in the C<svtype> enum.  Test these flags with the C<SvTYPE> macro.

The types are:

    SVt_NULL
    SVt_IV
    SVt_NV
    SVt_RV
    SVt_PV
    SVt_PVIV
    SVt_PVNV
    SVt_PVMG
    SVt_INVLIST
    SVt_REGEXP
    SVt_PVGV
    SVt_PVLV
    SVt_PVAV
    SVt_PVHV
    SVt_PVCV
    SVt_PVFM
    SVt_PVIO
    SVt_PVOBJ

These are most easily explained from the bottom up.

C<SVt_PVOBJ> is for object instances of the new `use feature 'class'` kind.
C<SVt_PVIO> is for I/O objects, C<SVt_PVFM> for formats, C<SVt_PVCV> for
subroutines, C<SVt_PVHV> for hashes and C<SVt_PVAV> for arrays.

All the others are scalar types, that is, things that can be bound to a
C<$> variable.  For these, the internal types are mostly orthogonal to
types in the Perl language.

Hence, checking C<< SvTYPE(sv) < SVt_PVAV >> is the best way to see whether
something is a scalar.

C<SVt_PVGV> represents a typeglob.  If C<!SvFAKE(sv)>, then it is a real,
incoercible typeglob.  If C<SvFAKE(sv)>, then it is a scalar to which a
typeglob has been assigned.  Assigning to it again will stop it from being
a typeglob.  C<SVt_PVLV> represents a scalar that delegates to another scalar
behind the scenes.  It is used, e.g., for the return value of C<substr> and
for tied hash and array elements.  It can hold any scalar value, including
a typeglob.  C<SVt_REGEXP> is for regular
expressions.  C<SVt_INVLIST> is for Perl
core internal use only.

C<SVt_PVMG> represents a "normal" scalar (not a typeglob, regular expression,
or delegate).  Since most scalars do not need all the internal fields of a
PVMG, we save memory by allocating smaller structs when possible.  All the
other types are just simpler forms of C<SVt_PVMG>, with fewer internal fields.
C<SVt_NULL> can only hold undef.  C<SVt_IV> can hold undef, an integer, or a
reference.  (C<SVt_RV> is an alias for C<SVt_IV>, which exists for backward
compatibility.)  C<SVt_NV> can hold undef or a double. (In builds that support
headless NVs, these could also hold a reference via a suitable offset, in the
same way that SVt_IV does, but this is not currently supported and seems to
be a rare use case.) C<SVt_PV> can hold C<undef>, a string, or a reference.
C<SVt_PVIV> is a superset of C<SVt_PV> and C<SVt_IV>. C<SVt_PVNV> is a
superset of C<SVt_PV> and C<SVt_NV>. C<SVt_PVMG> can hold anything C<SVt_PVNV>
can hold, but it may also be blessed or magical.

  These are ordered so that the simpler types have a lower value; SvUPGRADE
  doesn't allow you to upgrade from a higher numbered type to a lower numbered
  one; also there is code that assumes that anything that has as a PV component
  has a type numbered >= SVt_PV.

=for apidoc_section $SV

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvREFCNT|SV* sv
Returns the value of the object's reference count. Exposed
to perl code via Internals::SvREFCNT().

=for apidoc            SvREFCNT_inc
=for apidoc_item       SvREFCNT_inc_NN
=for apidoc_item |SV* |SvREFCNT_inc_simple|SV* sv
=for apidoc_item |SV* |SvREFCNT_inc_simple_NN|SV* sv

=for apidoc_item |void|SvREFCNT_inc_simple_void_NN|SV* sv
=for apidoc_item       SvREFCNT_inc_void
=for apidoc_item |void|SvREFCNT_inc_void_NN|SV* sv

These all increment the reference count of the given SV.
The ones without C<void> in their names return the SV.

C<SvREFCNT_inc> is the base operation; the rest are optimizations if various
input constraints are known to be true; hence, all can be replaced with
C<SvREFCNT_inc>.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_NN> can only be used if you know C<sv> is not C<NULL>.  Since we
don't have to check the NULLness, it's faster and smaller.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_void> can only be used if you don't need the
return value.  The macro doesn't need to return a meaningful value.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_void_NN> can only be used if you both don't need the return
value, and you know that C<sv> is not C<NULL>.  The macro doesn't need to
return a meaningful value, or check for NULLness, so it's smaller and faster.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_simple> can only be used with expressions without side
effects.  Since we don't have to store a temporary value, it's faster.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_simple_NN> can only be used with expressions without side
effects and you know C<sv> is not C<NULL>.  Since we don't have to store a
temporary value, nor check for NULLness, it's faster and smaller.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_simple_void> can only be used with expressions without side
effects and you don't need the return value.

C<SvREFCNT_inc_simple_void_NN> can only be used with expressions without side
effects, you don't need the return value, and you know C<sv> is not C<NULL>.

=for apidoc      SvREFCNT_dec
=for apidoc_item SvREFCNT_dec_set_NULL
=for apidoc_item SvREFCNT_dec_ret_NULL
=for apidoc_item SvREFCNT_dec_NN

These decrement the reference count of the given SV.

C<SvREFCNT_dec_NN> may only be used when C<sv> is known to not be C<NULL>.

The function C<SvREFCNT_dec_ret_NULL()> is identical to the
C<SvREFCNT_dec()> except it returns a NULL C<SV *>.  It is used by
C<SvREFCNT_dec_set_NULL()> which is a macro which will, when passed a
non-NULL argument, decrement the reference count of its argument and
then set it to NULL. You can replace code of the following form:

    if (sv) {
       SvREFCNT_dec_NN(sv);
       sv = NULL;
    }

with

    SvREFCNT_dec_set_NULL(sv);

=for apidoc Am|svtype|SvTYPE|SV* sv
Returns the type of the SV.  See C<L</svtype>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvUPGRADE|SV* sv|svtype type
Used to upgrade an SV to a more complex form.  Uses C<sv_upgrade> to
perform the upgrade if necessary.  See C<L</svtype>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvNIOK_off|SV* sv
Unsets the NV/IV status of an SV.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvOK|SV* sv
Returns a U32 value indicating whether the value is defined.  This is
only meaningful for scalars.

Returns a U32 value indicating whether the SV contains an integer.  Checks
the B<private> setting.  Use C<SvIOK> instead.

Checks the B<private> setting.  Use C<SvPOK> instead.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvIOK|SV* sv
Returns a U32 value indicating whether the SV contains an integer.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIOK_on|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is an integer.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIOK_off|SV* sv
Unsets the IV status of an SV.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIOK_only|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is an integer and disables all other C<OK> bits.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIOK_only_UV|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is an unsigned integer and disables all other C<OK> bits.

=for apidoc Am|bool|SvIOK_UV|SV* sv
Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV contains an integer that must be
interpreted as unsigned.  A non-negative integer whose value is within the
range of both an IV and a UV may be flagged as either C<SvUOK> or C<SvIOK>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|SvUOK|SV* sv
Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV contains an integer that must be
interpreted as unsigned.  A non-negative integer whose value is within the
range of both an IV and a UV may be flagged as either C<SvUOK> or C<SvIOK>.

=for apidoc Am|bool|SvIOK_notUV|SV* sv
Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV contains a signed integer.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvNOK|SV* sv
Returns a U32 value indicating whether the SV contains a double.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvNOK_on|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is a double.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvNOK_off|SV* sv
Unsets the NV status of an SV.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvNOK_only|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is a double and disables all other OK bits.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvPOK|SV* sv
Returns a U32 value indicating whether the SV contains a character
string.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvPOK_on|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is a string.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvPOK_off|SV* sv
Unsets the PV status of an SV.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvPOK_only|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is a string and disables all other C<OK> bits.
Will also turn off the UTF-8 status.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvBoolFlagsOK|SV* sv
Returns a bool indicating whether the SV has the right flags set such
that it is safe to call C<BOOL_INTERNALS_sv_isbool()> or
C<BOOL_INTERNALS_sv_isbool_true()> or
C<BOOL_INTERNALS_sv_isbool_false()>. Currently equivalent to
C<SvIandPOK(sv)> or C<SvIOK(sv) && SvPOK(sv)>. Serialization may want to
unroll this check. If so you are strongly recommended to add code like
C<assert(SvBoolFlagsOK(sv));> B<before> calling using any of the
BOOL_INTERNALS macros.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvIandPOK|SV* sv
Returns a bool indicating whether the SV is both C<SvPOK()> and
C<SvIOK()> at the same time. Equivalent to C<SvIOK(sv) && SvPOK(sv)> but
more efficient.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIandPOK_on|SV* sv
Tells an SV that is a string and a number in one operation. Equivalent
to C<SvIOK_on(sv); SvPOK_on(sv);> but more efficient.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIandPOK_off|SV* sv
Unsets the PV and IV status of an SV in one operation. Equivalent to
C<SvIOK_off(sv); SvPK_off(v);> but more efficient.

=for apidoc Am|bool|BOOL_INTERNALS_sv_isbool|SV* sv
Checks if a C<SvBoolFlagsOK()> sv is a bool. B<Note> that it is the
caller's responsibility to ensure that the sv is C<SvBoolFlagsOK()> before
calling this. This is only useful in specialized logic like
serialization code where performance is critical and the flags have
already been checked to be correct. Almost always you should be using
C<sv_isbool(sv)> instead.

=for apidoc Am|bool|BOOL_INTERNALS_sv_isbool_true|SV* sv
Checks if a C<SvBoolFlagsOK()> sv is a true bool. B<Note> that it is
the caller's responsibility to ensure that the sv is C<SvBoolFlagsOK()>
before calling this. This is only useful in specialized logic like
serialization code where performance is critical and the flags have
already been checked to be correct. This is B<NOT> what you should use
to check if an SV is "true", for that you should be using
C<SvTRUE(sv)> instead.

=for apidoc Am|bool|BOOL_INTERNALS_sv_isbool_false|SV* sv
Checks if a C<SvBoolFlagsOK()> sv is a false bool. B<Note> that it is
the caller's responsibility to ensure that the sv is C<SvBoolFlagsOK()>
before calling this. This is only useful in specialized logic like
serialization code where performance is critical and the flags have
already been checked to be correct. This is B<NOT> what you should use
to check if an SV is "false", for that you should be using
C<!SvTRUE(sv)> instead.

=for apidoc Am|bool|SvVOK|SV* sv
Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV contains a v-string.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvOOK|SV* sv
Returns a U32 indicating whether the pointer to the string buffer is offset.
This hack is used internally to speed up removal of characters from the
beginning of a C<L</SvPV>>.  When C<SvOOK> is true, then the start of the
allocated string buffer is actually C<SvOOK_offset()> bytes before C<SvPVX>.
This offset used to be stored in C<SvIVX>, but is now stored within the spare
part of the buffer.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvROK|SV* sv
Tests if the SV is an RV.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvROK_on|SV* sv
Tells an SV that it is an RV.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvROK_off|SV* sv
Unsets the RV status of an SV.

=for apidoc Am|SV*|SvRV|SV* sv
Dereferences an RV to return the SV.

=for apidoc Am|IV|SvIVX|SV* sv
Returns the raw value in the SV's IV slot, without checks or conversions.
Only use when you are sure C<SvIOK> is true.  See also C<L</SvIV>>.

=for apidoc Am|UV|SvUVX|SV* sv
Returns the raw value in the SV's UV slot, without checks or conversions.
Only use when you are sure C<SvIOK> is true.  See also C<L</SvUV>>.

=for apidoc AmD|UV|SvUVXx|SV* sv
This is an unnecessary synonym for L</SvUVX>

=for apidoc Am|NV|SvNVX|SV* sv
Returns the raw value in the SV's NV slot, without checks or conversions.
Only use when you are sure C<SvNOK> is true.  See also C<L</SvNV>>.

=for apidoc Am   |char*      |SvPVX|SV* sv
=for apidoc_item |const char*|SvPVX_const|SV* sv
=for apidoc_item |char*      |SvPVX_mutable|SV* sv
=for apidoc_item |char*      |SvPVXx|SV* sv

These return a pointer to the physical string in the SV.  The SV must contain a
string.  Prior to 5.9.3 it is not safe to execute these unless the SV's
type >= C<SVt_PV>.

These are also used to store the name of an autoloaded subroutine in an XS
AUTOLOAD routine.  See L<perlguts/Autoloading with XSUBs>.

C<SvPVXx> is identical to C<SvPVX>.

C<SvPVX_mutable> is merely a synonym for C<SvPVX>, but its name emphasizes that
the string is modifiable by the caller.

C<SvPVX_const> differs in that the return value has been cast so that the
compiler will complain if you were to try to modify the contents of the string,
(unless you cast away const yourself).

=for apidoc Am|STRLEN|SvCUR|SV* sv
Returns the length, in bytes, of the PV inside the SV.
Note that this may not match Perl's C<length>; for that, use
C<sv_len_utf8(sv)>. See C<L</SvLEN>> also.

=for apidoc Am|STRLEN|SvLEN|SV* sv
Returns the size of the string buffer in the SV, not including any part
attributable to C<SvOOK>.  See C<L</SvCUR>>.

=for apidoc Am|char*|SvEND|SV* sv
Returns a pointer to the spot just after the last character in
the string which is in the SV, where there is usually a trailing
C<NUL> character (even though Perl scalars do not strictly require it).
See C<L</SvCUR>>.  Access the character as C<*(SvEND(sv))>.

Warning: If C<SvCUR> is equal to C<SvLEN>, then C<SvEND> points to
unallocated memory.

=for apidoc Am|HV*|SvSTASH|SV* sv
Returns the stash of the SV.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvIV_set|SV* sv|IV val
Set the value of the IV pointer in sv to val.  It is possible to perform
the same function of this macro with an lvalue assignment to C<SvIVX>.
With future Perls, however, it will be more efficient to use
C<SvIV_set> instead of the lvalue assignment to C<SvIVX>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvNV_set|SV* sv|NV val
Set the value of the NV pointer in C<sv> to val.  See C<L</SvIV_set>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvPV_set|SV* sv|char* val
This is probably not what you want to use, you probably wanted
L</sv_usepvn_flags> or L</sv_setpvn> or L</sv_setpvs>.

Set the value of the PV pointer in C<sv> to the Perl allocated
C<NUL>-terminated string C<val>.  See also C<L</SvIV_set>>.

Remember to free the previous PV buffer. There are many things to check.
Beware that the existing pointer may be involved in copy-on-write or other
mischief, so do C<SvOOK_off(sv)> and use C<sv_force_normal> or
C<SvPV_force> (or check the C<SvIsCOW> flag) first to make sure this
modification is safe. Then finally, if it is not a COW, call
C<L</SvPV_free>> to free the previous PV buffer.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvUV_set|SV* sv|UV val
Set the value of the UV pointer in C<sv> to val.  See C<L</SvIV_set>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvRV_set|SV* sv|SV* val
Set the value of the RV pointer in C<sv> to val.  See C<L</SvIV_set>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvMAGIC_set|SV* sv|MAGIC* val
Set the value of the MAGIC pointer in C<sv> to val.  See C<L</SvIV_set>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvSTASH_set|SV* sv|HV* val
Set the value of the STASH pointer in C<sv> to val.  See C<L</SvIV_set>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvCUR_set|SV* sv|STRLEN len
Sets the current length, in bytes, of the C string which is in the SV.
See C<L</SvCUR>> and C<SvIV_set>>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvLEN_set|SV* sv|STRLEN len
Set the size of the string buffer for the SV. See C<L</SvLEN>>.

You should use this I<after> a call to C<L</SvPV>> or one of its variants, in

If you want to take into account the L<bytes> pragma, use C<L</DO_UTF8>>
instead.

Turn on the UTF-8 status of an SV (the data is not changed, just the flag).
Do not use frivolously.

A quick flag check to see whether an C<sv> should be passed to C<sv_force_normal>

For example, if your scalar is a reference and you want to modify the C<SvIVX>
slot, you can't just do C<SvROK_off>, as that will leak the referent.

This is used internally by various sv-modifying functions, such as
C<sv_setsv>, C<sv_setiv> and C<sv_pvn_force>.

One case that this does not handle is a gv without SvFAKE set.  After

    if (SvTHINKFIRST(gv)) sv_force_normal(gv);

it will still be a gv.

C<SvTHINKFIRST> sometimes produces false positives.  In those cases
C<sv_force_normal> does nothing.

some of Perl's fundamental security features.  XS module authors should not

untainting variables.

Taints an SV if tainting is enabled, and if some input to the current

the outputs of an expression in a pessimistic fashion; i.e., without paying

These are like C<L</SvPV>>, returning the string in the SV, but will force the
SV into containing a string (C<L</SvPOK>>), and only a string
(C<L</SvPOK_only>>), by hook or by crook.  You need to use one of these
C<force> routines if you are going to update the C<L</SvPVX>> directly.

Note that coercing an arbitrary scalar into a plain PV will potentially
strip useful data from it.  For example if the SV was C<SvROK>, then the
referent will have its reference count decremented, and the SV itself may
be converted to an C<SvPOK> scalar with a string buffer containing a value
such as C<"ARRAY(0x1234)">.

The differences between the forms are:

The forms with C<flags> in their names allow you to use the C<flags> parameter
to specify to perform 'get' magic (by setting the C<SV_GMAGIC> flag) or to skip
'get' magic (by clearing it).  The other forms do perform 'get' magic, except
for the ones with C<nomg> in their names, which skip 'get' magic.

The forms that take a C<len> parameter will set that variable to the byte
length of the resultant string (these are macros, so don't use C<&len>).

The forms with C<nolen> in their names indicate they don't have a C<len>
parameter.  They should be used only when it is known that the PV is a C
string, terminated by a NUL byte, and without intermediate NUL characters; or
when you don't care about its length.

The forms with C<mutable> in their names are effectively the same as those without,
but the name emphasizes that the string is modifiable by the caller, which it is
in all the forms.

C<SvPVutf8_force> is like C<SvPV_force>, but converts C<sv> to UTF-8 first if
not already UTF-8.

C<SvPVutf8x_force> is like C<SvPVutf8_force>, but guarantees to evaluate C<sv>
only once; use the more efficient C<SvPVutf8_force> otherwise.

C<SvPVbyte_force> is like C<SvPV_force>, but converts C<sv> to byte
representation first if currently encoded as UTF-8.  If the SV cannot be
downgraded from UTF-8, this croaks.

C<SvPVbytex_force> is like C<SvPVbyte_force>, but guarantees to evaluate C<sv>
only once; use the more efficient C<SvPVbyte_force> otherwise.

These each return a pointer to the string in C<sv>, or a stringified form of
C<sv> if it does not contain a string.  The SV may cache the stringified
version becoming C<SvPOK>.

This is a very basic and common operation, so there are lots of slightly
different versions of it.

Note that there is no guarantee that the return value of C<SvPV(sv)>, for
example, is equal to C<SvPVX(sv)>, or that C<SvPVX(sv)> contains valid data, or
that successive calls to C<SvPV(sv)> (or another of these forms) will return
the same pointer value each time.  This is due to the way that things like
overloading and Copy-On-Write are handled.  In these cases, the return value
may point to a temporary buffer or similar.  If you absolutely need the
C<SvPVX> field to be valid (for example, if you intend to write to it), then
see C<L</SvPV_force>>.

The differences between the forms are:

The forms with neither C<byte> nor C<utf8> in their names (e.g., C<SvPV> or
C<SvPV_nolen>) can expose the SV's internal string buffer. If
that buffer consists entirely of bytes 0-255 and includes any bytes above
127, then you B<MUST> consult C<SvUTF8> to determine the actual code points
the string is meant to contain. Generally speaking, it is probably safer to
prefer C<SvPVbyte>, C<SvPVutf8>, and the like. See
L<perlguts/How do I pass a Perl string to a C library?> for more details.

The forms with C<flags> in their names allow you to use the C<flags> parameter
to specify to process 'get' magic (by setting the C<SV_GMAGIC> flag) or to skip
'get' magic (by clearing it).  The other forms process 'get' magic, except for
the ones with C<nomg> in their names, which skip 'get' magic.

The forms that take a C<len> parameter will set that variable to the byte
length of the resultant string (these are macros, so don't use C<&len>).

The forms with C<nolen> in their names indicate they don't have a C<len>
parameter.  They should be used only when it is known that the PV is a C
string, terminated by a NUL byte, and without intermediate NUL characters; or
when you don't care about its length.

The forms with C<const> in their names return S<C<const char *>> so that the
compiler will hopefully complain if you were to try to modify the contents of
the string (unless you cast away const yourself).

The other forms return a mutable pointer so that the string is modifiable by
the caller; this is emphasized for the ones with C<mutable> in their names.

As of 5.38, all forms are guaranteed to evaluate C<sv> exactly once.  For
earlier Perls, use a form whose name ends with C<x> for single evaluation.

C<SvPVutf8> is like C<SvPV>, but converts C<sv> to UTF-8 first if not already
UTF-8.  Similarly, the other forms with C<utf8> in their names correspond to
their respective forms without.

C<SvPVutf8_or_null> and C<SvPVutf8_or_null_nomg> don't have corresponding
non-C<utf8> forms.  Instead they are like C<SvPVutf8_nomg>, but when C<sv> is
undef, they return C<NULL>.

C<SvPVbyte> is like C<SvPV>, but converts C<sv> to byte representation first if
currently encoded as UTF-8.  If C<sv> cannot be downgraded from UTF-8, it
croaks.  Similarly, the other forms with C<byte> in their names correspond to
their respective forms without.

C<SvPVbyte_or_null> doesn't have a corresponding non-C<byte> form.  Instead it
is like C<SvPVbyte>, but when C<sv> is undef, it returns C<NULL>.

=for apidoc      SvTRUE
=for apidoc_item SvTRUE_NN
=for apidoc_item SvTRUE_nomg
=for apidoc_item SvTRUE_nomg_NN
=for apidoc_item SvTRUEx

These return a boolean indicating whether Perl would evaluate the SV as true or
false.  See C<L</SvOK>> for a defined/undefined test.

As of Perl 5.32, all are guaranteed to evaluate C<sv> only once.  Prior to that
release, only C<SvTRUEx> guaranteed single evaluation; now C<SvTRUEx> is
identical to C<SvTRUE>.

C<SvTRUE_nomg> and C<TRUE_nomg_NN> do not perform 'get' magic; the others do
unless the scalar is already C<SvPOK>, C<SvIOK>, or C<SvNOK> (the public, not
the private flags).

C<SvTRUE_NN> is like C<L</SvTRUE>>, but C<sv> is assumed to be
non-null (NN).  If there is a possibility that it is NULL, use plain
C<SvTRUE>.

C<SvTRUE_nomg_NN> is like C<L</SvTRUE_nomg>>, but C<sv> is assumed to be
non-null (NN).  If there is a possibility that it is NULL, use plain
C<SvTRUE_nomg>.

=for apidoc Am|U32|SvIsCOW|SV* sv
Returns a U32 value indicating whether the SV is Copy-On-Write (either shared
hash key scalars, or full Copy On Write scalars if 5.9.0 is configured for
COW).

=for apidoc Am|bool|SvIsCOW_shared_hash|SV* sv
Returns a boolean indicating whether the SV is Copy-On-Write shared hash key
scalar.

=for apidoc_section $SV

=for apidoc Am|void|SvSETMAGIC|SV* sv
Invokes C<L</mg_set>> on an SV if it has 'set' magic.  This is necessary
after modifying a scalar, in case it is a magical variable like C<$|>
or a tied variable (it calls C<STORE>).  This macro evaluates its
argument more than once.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvSetMagicSV|SV* dsv|SV* ssv
=for apidoc_item    SvSetMagicSV_nosteal
=for apidoc_item    SvSetSV
=for apidoc_item    SvSetSV_nosteal

if C<dsv> is the same as C<ssv>, these do nothing.  Otherwise they all call
some form of C<L</sv_setsv>>.  They may evaluate their arguments more than
once.

The only differences are:

C<SvSetMagicSV> and C<SvSetMagicSV_nosteal> perform any required 'set' magic
afterwards on the destination SV; C<SvSetSV> and C<SvSetSV_nosteal> do not.

C<SvSetSV_nosteal> C<SvSetMagicSV_nosteal> call a non-destructive version of
C<sv_setsv>.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvSHARE|SV* sv
Arranges for C<sv> to be shared between threads if a suitable module
has been loaded.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvLOCK|SV* sv
Arranges for a mutual exclusion lock to be obtained on C<sv> if a suitable module
has been loaded.

=for apidoc Am|void|SvUNLOCK|SV* sv
Releases a mutual exclusion lock on C<sv> if a suitable module
has been loaded.

=for apidoc_section $SV

=for apidoc Am|char *|SvGROW|SV* sv|STRLEN len
Expands the character buffer in the SV so that it has room for the
indicated number of bytes (remember to reserve space for an extra trailing
C<NUL> character).  Calls C<sv_grow> to perform the expansion if necessary.
Returns a pointer to the character
buffer.  SV must be of type >= C<SVt_PV>.  One
alternative is to call C<sv_grow> if you are not sure of the type of SV.

You might mistakenly think that C<len> is the number of bytes to add to the
existing size, but instead it is the total size C<sv> should be.

=for apidoc Am|char *|SvPVCLEAR|SV* sv
Ensures that sv is a SVt_PV and that its SvCUR is 0, and that it is
properly null terminated. Equivalent to sv_setpvs(""), but more efficient.

=for apidoc Am|char *|SvPVCLEAR_FRESH|SV* sv

Reads into C<len> the offset from C<SvPVX> back to the true start of the
allocated buffer, which will be non-zero if C<sv_chop> has been used to
efficiently remove characters from start of the buffer.  Implemented as a
macro, which takes the address of C<len>, which must be of type C<STRLEN>.
Evaluates C<sv> more than once.  Sets C<len> to 0 if C<SvOOK(sv)> is false.

 * Bodyless IVs and NVs!
 *
 * Since 5.9.2, we can avoid allocating a body for SVt_IV-type SVs.
 * Since the larger IV-holding variants of SVs store their integer
 * values in their respective bodies, the family of SvIV() accessor
 * macros would  naively have to branch on the SV type to find the
 * integer value either in the HEAD or BODY. In order to avoid this
 * expensive branch, a clever soul has deployed a great hack:
 * We set up the SvANY pointer such that instead of pointing to a
 * real body, it points into the memory before the location of the
 * head. We compute this pointer such that the location of
 * the integer member of the hypothetical body struct happens to
 * be the same as the location of the integer member of the bodyless
 * SV head. This now means that the SvIV() family of accessors can
 * always read from the (hypothetical or real) body via SvANY.
 *
 * Since the 5.21 dev series, we employ the same trick for NVs
 * if the architecture can support it (NVSIZE <= IVSIZE).
