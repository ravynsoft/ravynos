=head1 NAME

README.pod - README for the F<Porting/> directory in the Perl 5 core distribution.

=head1 FILES

=head2 F<acknowledgements.pl>

Generates the text which goes in the Acknowledgements section in
a perldelta. You pass in the previous version and it guesses the next
version, fetches information from the repository and outputs the
text.

=head2 F<add-package.pl>

Program to prepare dual-life distributions for insertion into the Perl 5
F<lib/> and F<t/> directories.  Now thought to be largely superseded.

=head2 F<add-pod-file>

Program to facilitate addition of new F<.pod> files to F<pod/>.

=head2 F<bench.pl>

Do performance analysis on the code snippets in F<t/perf/benchmarks>.

=head2 F<bisect-example.sh>, F<bisect.pl> and F<bisect-runner.pl>

Use C<git bisect> to pinpoint changes.

=head2 F<bump-perl-version>

A utility to find, and optionally bump, references to the perl version
number in various files within the perl source.

=head2 F<checkansi.pl>

Check source code for ANSI-C violations.

=head2 F<checkcfguse.pl>

Check where the symbols defined in the various F<config.sh>-clones
are being used.  VMS is probably not handled properly here.

=head2 F<checkcfgvar.pl>

Check that the various F<config.sh>-clones have (at least) all the same
symbols as the top-level F<config_h.SH> so that the (potentially) needed
symbols are not lagging after how F<Configure> thinks the world is laid out.
VMS is probably not handled properly here, due to their own rather elaborate
DCL scripting.

=head2 F<check-cpan-pollution>

Scans the commit logs for commits that are potentially, illegitimately
touching modules that are primarily maintained outside of the perl core.  Also
checks for commits that span multiple distributions in F<cpan/> or F<dist/>.
Makes sure that updated CPAN distributions also update
F<Porting/Maintainers.pl>, but otherwise ignores changes to that file (and
F<MANIFEST>).

=head2 F<checkpodencoding.pl>

Check if POD files contain non-ASCII without specifying
encoding. Run it as: C<perl Porting/checkpodencoding.pl>.

=head2 F<checkURL.pl>

Checks that all the URLs in the Perl source are valid.

=head2 F<checkVERSION.pl>

Used by F<t/porting/cmp_version.t> to ensure changed modules have had their
versions updated.

=head2 F<cmpVERSION.pl>

Compare the current Perl source tree and a given tag for modules that have
identical version numbers but different contents.

=head2 F<config_H>

This file is a sample F<config.h> file.  If you are unable to successfully run
F<Configure>, copy this file to F<config.h> and edit it to suit your system.

=head2 F<config_h.pl>

Used when importing changes from F<metaconfig>.  This script reorders
F<config_h.SH> after metaconfig.

=head2 F<config.sh>

This file is a sample F<config.sh> file.  F<config.sh> is normally
produced by running the F<Configure> script. It holds all the definitions
figured out by F<Configure>.  If you are unable to successfully run
F<Configure> on your system, copy this sample file to F<config.sh>
at the top of the perl source tree and edit it to suit your system.
Then propagate those values by running C<Configure -S>.  This sample
file is normally updated each time F<Configure> is updated.

=head2 F<core-cpan-diff>

Compare CPAN modules with their equivalent in core. 
Originally based on App::DualLivedDiff by Steffen Mueller.

=head2 F<corecpan.pl>

any previous attempts.
