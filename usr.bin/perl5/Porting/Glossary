!!!!!!!   DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE   !!!!!!!
This file is built by metaconfig.

This file contains a description of all the shell variables whose value is
determined by the Configure script.  Variables intended for use in C
programs (e.g. I_UNISTD) are already described in config_h.SH.  [`configpm'
generates pod documentation for Config.pm from this file--please try to keep
the formatting regular.]

_a (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for ordinary library files.
	For unix, it is '.a'.  The '.' is included.  Other possible
	values include '.lib'.

_exe (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
	DJGPP, Cygwin and OS/2 use '.exe'.  Stratus VOS uses '.pm'.
	On operating systems which do not require a specific extension
	for executable files, this variable is empty.

_o (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for object files.
	For unix, it is '.o'.  The '.' is included.  Other possible
	values include '.obj'.

afs (afs.U):
	This variable is set to 'true' if AFS (Andrew File System) is used
	on the system, 'false' otherwise.  It is possible to override this
	with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
	what you are doing.

afsroot (afs.U):
	This variable is by default set to '/afs'. In the unlikely case
	this is not the correct root, it is possible to override this with
	a hint value or command line option.  This will be used in subsequent
	tests for AFSness in the configure and test process.

alignbytes (alignbytes.U):
	This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
	double-- or a long double when applicable. Usual values are
	2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

aphostname (d_gethname.U):
	This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
	host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
	it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

api_revision (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_revision is the '5'.
	Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
	like 5.00563.

	perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically search in
	$sitelib/.. for older directories back to the limit specified
	by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
	perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
	directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
	possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
	system is determined in inc_version_list.U.

	XXX To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time
	options (such as bincompat, longlong, etc.) it should
	(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
	Currently, we read a hard-wired value from patchlevel.h.
	Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
	patchlevel.h but then modify it if the current Configure
	options warrant.  patchlevel.h then would use an #ifdef guard.

api_subversion (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_subversion is the '1'.  See api_revision for
	full details.

api_version (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_version is the '6'.  See api_revision for
	full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the
	old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series,
	this was the only versioned directory in $sitelib.)

api_versionstring (patchlevel.U):
	This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1) suitable
	for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

ar (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the ar program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "ar" and is not useful.

archlib (archlib.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put architecture-dependent public library files for $package.
	It is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/lib.
	Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal
	with filename expansion.

archlibexp (archlib.U):
	This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is
	filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.

archname (archname.U):
	This variable is a short name to characterize the current
	architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.

archname64 (use64bits.U):
	This variable is used for the 64-bitness part of $archname.

archobjs (Unix.U):
	This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
	in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
	empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
	or other facilities.  For perl on OS/2, for example, this would
	include os2/os2.obj.

asctime_r_proto (d_asctime_r.U):
	This variable encodes the prototype of asctime_r.
	It is zero if d_asctime_r is undef, and one of the
	REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC macros of reentr.h if d_asctime_r
	is defined.

	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put publicly executable images for the package in question.  It
	is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/bin. Programs using
	this variable must be prepared to deal with ~name substitution.

	This variable saves the result from configure if generated binaries
	are in ELF format. Only set to defined when the test has actually
	been performed, and the result was positive.

	configuration time, for use in your makefiles.

bison (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the

	full pathname (if any) of the byacc program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "byacc" and is not useful.

	This variable holds the byte order in a UV. In the following,
	larger digits indicate more significance.  The variable byteorder
	is either 4321 on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a little-endian,
	or 87654321 on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

c (n.U):
	This variable contains the \c string if that is what causes the echo
	command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
	$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

	This variable contains a flag that precise difficulties the
	compiler has casting odd floating values to unsigned long:
	0 = ok

	flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using
	the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be 'workshop'.

ccsymbols (Cppsym.U):
	The variable contains the symbols defined by the C compiler alone.

	This variable contains a single string giving the command-line
	arguments passed to Configure.	Spaces within arguments,
	quotes, and escaped characters are not correctly preserved.
	To reconstruct the command line, you must assemble the individual
	command line pieces, given in config_arg[0-9]*.

contains (contains.U):
	This variable holds the command to do a grep with a proper return

	cannot be linked against).

inc_version_list (inc_version_list.U):
	This variable specifies the list of subdirectories in over
	which perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
	search when adding directories to @INC.  The elements in
	the list are separated by spaces.  This is only useful
	if you have a perl library directory tree structured like the
	default one.  See INSTALL for how this works.  The versioned
	site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the
	lowest possible value.

	This list includes architecture-dependent directories back to
	version $api_versionstring (e.g. 5.5.640) and
	architecture-independent directories all the way back to
	5.005.

inc_version_list_init (inc_version_list.U):
	This variable holds the same list as inc_version_list, but
	each item is enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas,
	suitable for use in the PERL_INC_VERSION_LIST initialization.

incpath (usrinc.U):
	This variable must precede the normal include path to get the
	right one, as in "$incpath/usr/include" or "$incpath/usr/lib".
	Value can be "" or "/bsd43" on mips.

incpth (libpth.U):
	This variable must precede the normal include path to get the
	right one, as in "$incpath/usr/include" or "$incpath/usr/lib".
	Value can be "" or "/bsd43" on mips.

inews (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

initialinstalllocation (bin.U):
	When userelocatableinc is true, this variable holds the location
	that make install should copy the perl binary to, with all the
	run-time relocatable paths calculated from this at install time.
	When used, it is initialized to the original value of binexp, and
	then binexp is set to '.../', as the other binaries are found
	relative to the perl binary.

installarchlib (archlib.U):
	This variable is really the same as archlibexp but may differ on
	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
	should be used in makefiles.

	the user is explicitly prompted for it. This variable should always
	be used in your makefiles for maximum portability.

	using a different installprefix.  For extra portability, you
	should only use this variable within your makefiles.

	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installman3dir (man3dir.U):
	This variable is really the same as man3direxp, unless you are using
	AFS in which case it points to the read/write location whereas
	man3direxp only points to the read-only access location. For extra
	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installprefix (installprefix.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory below which
	"make install" will install the package.  For most users, this
	is the same as prefix.  However, it is useful for
	installing the software into a different (usually temporary)
	location after which it can be bundled up and moved somehow
	to the final location specified by prefix.

installprefixexp (installprefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of installprefix
	with all ~-expansion done.

installprivlib (privlib.U):
	This variable is really the same as privlibexp but may differ on
	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
	should be used in makefiles.

	This variable is usually the same as scriptdirexp, unless you are on
	a system running AFS, in which case they may differ slightly. You
	should always use this variable within your makefiles for portability.

	This variable is really the same as sitearchexp but may differ on
	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
	should be used in makefiles.

	should always use this variable within your makefiles for portability.

installsitehtml1dir (sitehtml1dir.U):
	This variable is really the same as sitehtml1direxp, unless you are using
	AFS in which case it points to the read/write location whereas

	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installsitelib (sitelib.U):
	This variable is really the same as sitelibexp but may differ on
	those systems using AFS. For extra portability, only this variable
	should be used in makefiles.

	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installsiteman3dir (siteman3dir.U):
	This variable is really the same as siteman3direxp, unless you are using
	AFS in which case it points to the read/write location whereas
	man3direxp only points to the read-only access location. For extra
	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installsitescript (sitescript.U):
	This variable is usually the same as sitescriptexp, unless you are on
	a system running AFS, in which case they may differ slightly. You
	should always use this variable within your makefiles for portability.

installstyle (installstyle.U):
	This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.
	This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
	manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
	this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
	stored directly in Config.pm.  Currently, there are only two
	styles:  "lib" and "lib/perl5".  The default library locations
	(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either $prefix/lib or
	$prefix/lib/perl5.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
	directory dedicated to perl (e.g. /opt/perl), while the latter
	is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
	$prefix=/usr/local.

	Unfortunately, while this "style" variable is used to set
	defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and
	site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually
	appropriate for all those directories.  For example, $prefix
	might be /opt/perl, but $siteprefix might be /usr/local.
	(Perhaps, in retrospect, the "lib" style should never have been
	supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)

	The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
	that can be used to install additional modules into
	non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install
	a module into a private directory (perhaps by setting PREFIX on
	the Makefile.PL command line), then there is no reason to
	assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be
	relevant for that PREFIX.

	This may later be extended to include other information, so
	be careful with pattern-matching on the results.

	For compatibility with perl5.005 and earlier, the default
	setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
	"perl".

known_extensions (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds a list of all extensions (both XS and non-xs)
	included in the package source distribution.  This information is
	only really of use during the Perl build, as the list makes no
	distinction between extensions which were build and installed, and
	those which where not.  See "extensions" for the list of extensions
	actually built and available.

	This variable shows if the loader accepts scripts in the form of
	-Wl,--version-script=ld.script. This is currently only supported
	for GNU ld on ELF in dynamic loading builds.

lddlflags (dlsrc.U):
	This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
	passed to $ld to create a shared library suitable for dynamic
	loading.  It is up to the makefile to use it.  For hpux, it
	should be '-b'.  For sunos 4.1, it is empty.

libc (libc.U):
	This variable contains the location of the C library.

libperl (libperl.U):
	The perl executable is obtained by linking perlmain.c with
	libperl, any static extensions (usually just DynaLoader),

	is usually libperl.a, but can also be libperl.so.xxx if
	the user wishes to build a perl executable with a shared
	library.

libpth (libpth.U):
	This variable holds the general path (space-separated) used to find

	search.  The order is chosen to pick up the c library
	ahead of ucb or bsd libraries for SVR4.

libswanted_uselargefiles (uselfs.U):
	This variable contains the libraries needed by large file builds
	and added to ldflags by hints files.  It is a space separated list
	of the library names without the "lib" prefix or any suffix, just
	like libswanted..

line (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

	symbolic links (if they are supported).  It can be used
	in the Makefile. It is either 'ln -s' or 'ln'

localtime_r_proto (d_localtime_r.U):
	This variable encodes the prototype of localtime_r.
	It is zero if d_localtime_r is undef, and one of the
	REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC macros of reentr.h if d_localtime_r
	is defined.

locincpth (ccflags.U):
	This variable contains a list of additional directories to be
	searched by the compiler.  The appropriate '-I' directives will
	be added to ccflags.  This is intended to simplify setting
	local directories from the Configure command line.
	It's not much, but it parallels the loclibpth stuff in libpth.U.

loclibpth (libpth.U):
	This variable holds the paths (space-separated) used to find local
	libraries.  It is prepended to libpth, and is intended to be easily
	set from the command line.

	2 = IEEE 754 128-bit big endian,
	3 = x86 80-bit little endian,
	4 = x86 80-bit big endian,
	5 = double-double 128-bit little endian,
	6 = double-double 128-bit big endian,
	7 = 128-bit mixed-endian double-double (64-bit LEs in BE),

	-1 = unknown format.

longdblmantbits (mantbits.U):
	This symbol, if defined, tells how many mantissa bits
	there are in long double precision floating point format.
	Note that this can be LDBL_MANT_DIG minus one,
	since LDBL_MANT_DIG can include the IEEE 754 implicit bit.
	The common x86-style 80-bit long double does not have
	an implicit bit.

longdblnanbytes (infnan.U):
	This variable contains comma-separated list of hexadecimal bytes
	for the long double precision not-a-number.

longdblsize (d_longdbl.U):
	This variable contains the value of the LONG_DOUBLESIZE symbol, which
	indicates to the C program how many bytes there are in a long double,
	if this system supports long doubles.  Note that this is
	sizeof(long double), which may include unused bytes.

	This variable contains the string to be included in Makefile.SH
	so that MAKE is set if needed, and not if not needed.
	Possible values are:

	make_set_make='#'		# If your make program handles this for you,

	make_set_make="MAKE=$make"	# if it doesn't.

	This uses a comment character so that we can distinguish a
	'set' value (from a previous config.sh or Configure '-D' option)
	from an uncomputed value.

mallocobj (mallocsrc.U):
	This variable contains the name of the malloc.o that this package
	generates, if that malloc.o is preferred over the system malloc.
	Otherwise the value is null.  This variable is intended for generating
	Makefiles.  See mallocsrc.

mallocsrc (mallocsrc.U):
	This variable contains the name of the malloc.c that comes with

	This variable is the same as the man1dir variable, but is filename
	expanded at configuration time, for convenient use in makefiles.

man1ext (man1dir.U):
	This variable contains the extension that the manual page should
	have: one of 'n', 'l', or '1'.  The Makefile must supply the '.'.

	This variable is the same as the man3dir variable, but is filename
	expanded at configuration time, for convenient use in makefiles.

man3ext (man3dir.U):
	This variable contains the extension that the manual page should
	have: one of 'n', 'l', or '3'.  The Makefile must supply the '.'.
	See man3dir.

mips_type (usrinc.U):
	This variable holds the environment type for the mips system.
	Possible values are "BSD 4.3" and "System V".

mistrustnm (Csym.U):
	This variable can be used to establish a fallthrough for the cases
	where nm fails to find a symbol.  If usenm is false or usenm is true
	and mistrustnm is false, this variable has no effect.  If usenm is true
	and mistrustnm is "compile", a test program will be compiled to try to
	find any symbol that can't be located via nm lookup.  If mistrustnm is
	"run", the test program will be run as well as being compiled.

mkdir (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the mkdir program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "mkdir" and is not useful.

mmaptype (d_mmap.U):

	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

myarchname (archname.U):
	This variable holds the architecture name computed by Configure in
	a previous run. It is not intended to be perused by any user and
	should never be set in a hint file.

mydomain (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the MYDOMAIN symbol,
	which is the domain of the host the program is going to run on.
	The domain must be appended to myhostname to form a complete host name.
	The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

myhostname (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the MYHOSTNAME symbol,
	which is the name of the host the program is going to run on.
	The domain is not kept with hostname, but must be gotten from mydomain.
	The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

myuname (Oldconfig.U):
	The output of 'uname -a' if available, otherwise the hostname.
	The whole thing is then lower-cased and slashes and single quotes are
	removed.

n (n.U):
	This variable contains the '-n' flag if that is what causes the echo
	command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
	$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

need_va_copy (need_va_copy.U):
	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system stores
	the variable argument list datatype, va_list, in a format
	that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some
	other means must be used when copying is required.
	As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision)
	of copying mechanisms, handy.h defines a platform-
	independent macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to do the job.

netdb_hlen_type (netdbtype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the 2nd argument to
	gethostbyaddr().  Usually, this is int or size_t or unsigned.
	This is only useful if you have gethostbyaddr(), naturally.

netdb_host_type (netdbtype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the 1st argument to
	gethostbyaddr().  Usually, this is char * or void *,  possibly
	with or without a const prefix.
	This is only useful if you have gethostbyaddr(), naturally.

netdb_name_type (netdbtype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the argument to
	gethostbyname().  Usually, this is char * or const char *.
	This is only useful if you have gethostbyname(), naturally.

netdb_net_type (netdbtype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the 1st argument to

nm_opt (usenm.U):
	This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm.

nm_so_opt (usenm.U):
	This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm
	to work on a shared library but that can not be used on an
	archive library.  Currently, this is only used by Linux, where
	nm --dynamic is *required* to get symbols from an ELF library which
	has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is *fatal* on an archive library.
	Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

nonxs_ext (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions built and
	installed by the package.  By default, all non-xs extensions
	distributed will be built, with the exception of platform-specific
	extensions (currently only one VMS specific extension).

nroff (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the nroff program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "nroff" and is not useful.

nv_overflows_integers_at (perlxv.U):
	This variable gives the largest integer value that NVs can hold
	as a constant floating point expression.

	os_4.1, etc., not keeping separate files for each little release.

otherlibdirs (otherlibdirs.U):
	This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl
	binary to search for additional library files or modules.

	This variable contains the string to put on the front of a perl
	script to make sure (hopefully) that it runs with perl and not some
	shell. Of course, that leading line must be followed by the classical
	perl idiom:
	eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@"}'
	if $running_under_some_shell;
	to guarantee perl startup should the shell execute the script. Note
	that this magic incantation is not understood by csh.

sysroot (Sysroot.U):
	This variable is empty unless supplied by the Configure user.

	and indicates that 64-bit integer types should be used
	when available.  The maximal possible
	64-bitness is employed: LP64 or ILP64, meaning that you will
	be able to use more than 2 gigabytes of memory.  This mode is

	less portable.  See also mallocsrc and mallocobj.
	If this is 'y', then -lmalloc is removed from $libs.

usenm (usenm.U):
	This variable contains 'true' or 'false' depending whether the
	nm extraction is wanted or not.

usensgetexecutablepath (usensgetexecutablepath.U):

	not even prompted for.

userelocatableinc (bin.U):
	This variable is set to true to indicate that perl should relocate
	@INC entries at runtime based on the path to the perl binary.
	Any @INC paths starting ".../" are relocated relative to the directory
	containing the perl binary, and a logical cleanup of the path is then
	made around the join point (removing "dir/../" pairs)

	This variable contains the name of the directory for man1
	pages.  It may have a ~ on the front.
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place their own
	man1 pages in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

vendorman1direxp (vendorman1dir.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorman1dir, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

vendorman3dir (vendorman3dir.U):
	This variable contains the name of the directory for man3
	pages.  It may have a ~ on the front.
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place their own
	man3 pages in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

vendorman3direxp (vendorman3dir.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorman3dir, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

vendorprefix (vendorprefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below
	which the vendor will install add-on packages.
	See INSTALL for usage and examples.

vendorprefixexp (vendorprefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of the directory below
	which the vendor will install add-on packages.  Derived from vendorprefix.

vendorscript (vendorscript.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the VENDORSCRIPT symbol.
	It may have a ~ on the front.
	The standard distribution will put nothing in this directory.
	Vendors who distribute perl may wish to place additional
	executable scripts in this directory with
	MakeMaker Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=vendor
	or equivalent.  See INSTALL for details.

vendorscriptexp (vendorscript.U):
	This variable is the ~name expanded version of vendorscript, so that you
	may use it directly in Makefiles or shell scripts.

version (patchlevel.U):
	The full version number of this package, such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1).
	This combines revision, patchlevel, and subversion to get the
	full version number, including any possible subversions.
	This is suitable for use as a directory name, and hence is
	filesystem dependent.

version_patchlevel_string (patchlevel.U):
	This is a string combining version, subversion and
	perl_patchlevel (if perl_patchlevel is non-zero).
	It is typically something like
	'version 7 subversion 1'  or
	'version 7 subversion 1 patchlevel 11224'
	It is computed here to avoid duplication of code in myconfig.SH
	and lib/Config.pm.

versiononly (versiononly.U):
	If set, this symbol indicates that only the version-specific
	components of a perl installation should be installed.
	This may be useful for making a test installation of a new
	version without disturbing the existing installation.
	Setting versiononly is equivalent to setting installperl's -v option.
	In particular, the non-versioned scripts and programs such as
	a2p, c2ph, h2xs, pod2*, and perldoc are not installed
	(see INSTALL for a more complete list).  Nor are the man
	pages installed.
	Usually, this is undef.

vi (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

xlibpth (libpth.U):
	This variable holds extra path (space-separated) used to find
	libraries on this platform, for example CPU-specific libraries
	(on multi-CPU platforms) may be listed here.

xlocale_needed (d_newlocale.U):
	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the C program should
	include <xlocale.h> to get newlocale() and its friends.

yacc (yacc.U):
	This variable holds the name of the compiler compiler we
	want to use in the Makefile. It can be yacc, byacc, or bison -y.

yaccflags (yacc.U):
	This variable contains any additional yacc flags desired by the
	user.  It is up to the Makefile to use this.

zcat (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

zip (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the zip program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "zip" and is not useful.
