=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::Miniperl - write the C code for miniperlmain.c and perlmain.c

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use ExtUtils::Miniperl;
    writemain(@directories);
    # or
    writemain($fh, @directories);
    # or
    writemain(\$filename, @directories);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<writemain()> takes an argument list of zero or more directories
containing archive
libraries that relate to perl modules and should be linked into a new
perl binary. It writes a corresponding F<miniperlmain.c> or F<perlmain.c>
file that
is a plain C file containing all the bootstrap code to make the
modules associated with the libraries available from within perl.
If the first argument to C<writemain()> is a reference to a scalar it is
used as the filename to open for output. Any other reference is used as
the filehandle to write to. Otherwise output defaults to C<STDOUT>.

The typical usage is from within perl's own Makefile (to build
F<perlmain.c>) or from F<regen/miniperlmain.pl> (to build miniperlmain.c).
So under normal circumstances you won't have to deal with this module
directly.
