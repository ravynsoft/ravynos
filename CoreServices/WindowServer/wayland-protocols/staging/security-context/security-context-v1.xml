  <interface name="wp_security_context_manager_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="client security context manager">
      This interface allows a client to register a new Wayland connection to
      the compositor and attach a security context to it.

      This is intended to be used by sandboxes. Sandbox engines attach a
      security context to all connections coming from inside the sandbox. The
      compositor can then restrict the features that the sandboxed connections
      can use.

      Compositors should forbid nesting multiple security contexts by not
      exposing wp_security_context_manager_v1 global to clients with a security
      context attached, or by sending the nested protocol error. Nested
      security contexts are dangerous because they can potentially allow
      privilege escalation of a sandboxed client.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        Creates a new security context with a socket listening FD.

        The compositor will accept new client connections on listen_fd.
        listen_fd must be ready to accept new connections when this request is
        sent by the client. In other words, the client must call bind(2) and
        listen(2) before sending the FD.

        close_fd is a FD closed by the client when the compositor should stop
        accepting new connections on listen_fd.

        The compositor must continue to accept connections on listen_fd when
        the Wayland client which created the security context disconnects.

        After sending this request, closing listen_fd and close_fd remains the
        only valid operation on them.

        The compositor may use the application ID to group clients belonging to

        Whether this request is optional or not depends on the sandbox engine used.
