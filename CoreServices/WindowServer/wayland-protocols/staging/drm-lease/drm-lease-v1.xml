    <description summary="lease device">
      This protocol is used by Wayland compositors which act as Direct
      Renderering Manager (DRM) masters to lease DRM resources to Wayland
      clients.

      The compositor will advertise one wp_drm_lease_device_v1 global for each
      DRM node. Some time after a client binds to the wp_drm_lease_device_v1
      global, the compositor will send a drm_fd event followed by zero, one or
      more connector events. After all currently available connectors have been
      sent, the compositor will send a wp_drm_lease_device_v1.done event.

      When the list of connectors available for lease changes the compositor
      will send wp_drm_lease_device_v1.connector events for added connectors and
      wp_drm_lease_connector_v1.withdrawn events for removed connectors,
      followed by a wp_drm_lease_device_v1.done event.

      The compositor will indicate when a device is gone by removing the global
      via a wl_registry.global_remove event. Upon receiving this event, the
      client should destroy any matching wp_drm_lease_device_v1 object.

      To destroy a wp_drm_lease_device_v1 object, the client must first issue
      a release request. Upon receiving this request, the compositor will
      immediately send a released event and destroy the object. The client must
      continue to process and discard drm_fd and connector events until it
      receives the released event. Upon receiving the released event, the
      client can safely cleanup any client-side resources.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
      phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
      corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
      only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

        The compositor will send this event when the wp_drm_lease_device_v1
        global is bound, although there are no guarantees as to how long this
        takes - the compositor might need to wait until regaining DRM master.
        The included fd is a non-master DRM file descriptor opened for this
        device and the compositor must not authenticate it.
        The purpose of this event is to give the client the ability to
        query DRM and discover information which may help them pick the
        appropriate DRM device or select the appropriate connectors therein.

        The compositor will use this event to advertise connectors available for

        indicate the client would like to lease that connector, see
        wp_drm_lease_request_v1.request_connector for details. While the
        compositor will make a best effort to not send disconnected connectors,
        no guarantees can be made.

        The compositor must send the drm_fd event before sending connectors.
        After the drm_fd event it will send all available connectors but may
        send additional connectors at any time.
