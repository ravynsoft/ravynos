  <description summary="list toplevels">
    The purpose of this protocol is to provide protocol object handles for
    toplevels, possibly originating from another client.

    This protocol is intentionally minimalistic and expects additional
    functionality (e.g. creating a screencopy source from a toplevel handle,
    getting information about the state of the toplevel) to be implemented
    in extension protocols.

    The compositor may choose to restrict this protocol to a special client
    launched by the compositor itself or expose it to all clients,
    this is compositor policy.

    The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
    "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in IETF RFC 2119.

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing
    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the
    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can
    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.

  <interface name="ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="list toplevels">
      A toplevel is defined as a surface with a role similar to xdg_toplevel.
      XWayland surfaces may be treated like toplevels in this protocol.

      After a client binds the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1, each mapped
      toplevel window will be sent using the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.toplevel
      event.

      Clients which only care about the current state can perform a roundtrip after
      binding this global.

      For each instance of ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1, the compositor must
      create a new ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object for each mapped toplevel.

      If a compositor implementation sends the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.finished
      event after the global is bound, the compositor must not send any
      ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.toplevel events.
    </description>

    <event name="toplevel">
      <description summary="a toplevel has been created">
        This event is emitted whenever a new toplevel window is created. It is
        emitted for all toplevels, regardless of the app that has created them.

        All initial properties of the toplevel (identifier, title, app_id) will be sent
        immediately after this event using the corresponding events for
        ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1. The compositor will use the
        ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1.done event to indicate when all data has
        been sent.

    <event name="finished">
      <description summary="the compositor has finished with the toplevel manager">
        This event indicates that the compositor is done sending events
        to this object. The client should should destroy the object.
        See ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.destroy for more information.

        The compositor must not send any more toplevel events after this event.

    <request name="stop">
      <description summary="stop sending events">
        This request indicates that the client no longer wishes to receive
        events for new toplevels.

        The Wayland protocol is asynchronous, meaning the compositor may send
        further toplevel events until the stop request is processed.
        The client should wait for a ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.finished
        event before destroying this object.

    </request>

    <request name="destroy" type="destructor">
      <description summary="destroy the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1 object">
        This request should be called either when the client will no longer
        use the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1 or after the finished event
        has been received to allow destruction of the object.

        If a client wishes to destroy this object it should send a
        ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.stop request and wait for a ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1.finished
        event, then destroy the handles and then this object.

  <interface name="ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="a mapped toplevel">
      A ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object represents a mapped toplevel
      window. A single app may have multiple mapped toplevels.
    </description>

    <request name="destroy" type="destructor">
      <description summary="destroy the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 object">
        This request should be used when the client will no longer use the handle
        or after the closed event has been received to allow destruction of the
        object.

        When a handle is destroyed, a new handle may not be created by the server
        until the toplevel is unmapped and then remapped. Destroying a toplevel handle
        is not recommended unless the client is cleaning up child objects
        before destroying the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1 object, the toplevel
        was closed or the toplevel handle will not be used in the future.

        Other protocols which extend the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1
        interface should require destructors for extension interfaces be
        called before allowing the toplevel handle to be destroyed.
      </description>
    </request>

    <event name="closed">
      <description summary="the toplevel has been closed">
        The server will emit no further events on the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1
        after this event. Any requests received aside from the destroy request must
        be ignored. Upon receiving this event, the client should destroy the handle.

        Other protocols which extend the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1
        interface must also ignore requests other than destructors.
      </description>
    </event>

    <event name="done">
      <description summary="all information about the toplevel has been sent">
        This event is sent after all changes in the toplevel state have
        been sent.

        This allows changes to the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 properties
        to be atomically applied. Other protocols which extend the
        ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1 interface may use this event to also
        atomically apply any pending state.

        This event must not be sent after the ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1.closed
        event.

    <event name="title">
      <description summary="title change">
        The title of the toplevel has changed.

        The configured state must not be applied immediately. See
        ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1.done for details.

    <event name="identifier">
      <description summary="a stable identifier for a toplevel">
        This identifier is used to check if two or more toplevel handles belong
        to the same toplevel.

        The identifier is useful for command line tools or privileged clients
        which may need to reference an exact toplevel across processes or
        instances of the ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1 global.

        The compositor must only send this event when the handle is created.

        The identifier must be unique per toplevel and it's handles. Two different
        toplevels must not have the same identifier. The identifier is only valid
        as long as the toplevel is mapped. If the toplevel is unmapped the identifier
        must not be reused. An identifier must not be reused by the compositor to
        ensure there are no races when sharing identifiers between processes.

        An identifier is a string that contains up to 32 printable ASCII bytes.
        An identifier must not be an empty string. It is recommended that a
        compositor includes an opaque generation value in identifiers. How the
        generation value is used when generating the identifier is implementation
        dependent.
