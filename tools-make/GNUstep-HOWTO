1 Introduction
**************

This document explains how to build the GNUstep core libraries.  The
core libraries, along with associated tools and other files provide
everything necessary for a working GNUstep system.

   In order to easily compile and debug GNUstep projects, you will need
the GNU Objective-C compiler `GCC' as well as various other GNU
packages.

   You will need at least 80Mb of hard disk space (150Mb prefered) in
order to compile the GNUstep core libraries.

2 Summary
*********

In order to compile the libraries, you need to compile and install the
following packages first (if you don't already have them):

   * gcc (Version 2.95 or greater, 3.0.4 or greater recommended)

   * GNU make (Version 3.75 or greater)

   * gdb (Version 6.0 or greater recommended), if you plan to do any
     debugging

   You may also need to install some of the following libraries and
packages described below. Most of these packages are optional, but some
are required.

`ffcall libraries (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)'
     This is a library that provides stack-frame handling for
     NSInvocation and NSConnection. This library is highly recommended.
     The previous builtin method for stack frame handling is no longer
     supported and may be removed in the future.  ffcall is under GNU
     GPL. As a special exception, if used in GNUstep or in derivate
     works of GNUstep, the included parts of ffcall are under GNU LGPL.

`libffi library (ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION)'
     This is a library that provides stack frame handling for
     NSInvocation and NSConnection similar to ffcall.  Use this instead
     of ffcall. You don't need both.

`libxml2 (RECOMMENDED)'
     The libxml library (Version 2) is used to translate some of the
     documentation for GNUstep and to provide suport for MacOS-X
     compatible XML-based property-lists. It is not required, but you
     have to explicitly disable use of XML when compiling GNUstep base
     if you do not have it.

`libxslt (OPTIONAL)'
     Stylesheet support for use with XML.

`openssl (OPTIONAL)'
     The openssl library is used to provide support for https
     connections by the NSURL and HSURLHandle classes.  This
     functionality is compiled as a separate bundle since the OpenSSL
     license is not compatible with GPL, and in the hopes that if
     someone writes an openssl replacement, it can quickly be used by
     creating another bundle.

`libiconv (OPTIONAL)'
     Note: Do not install this library unless you are sure you need it.
     You probably don't need it except perhaps on MinGW.  Unicode
     support functions (iconv) come with glibc version 2.1 or greater.
     If you don't have glibc (try iconv -version), you can get the
     separate libiconv library from
     `http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/packages-libiconv.html'. However,
     neither one is required to use GNUstep.

`The TIFF library (libtiff) (Version 3.4beta36 or greater) (REQUIRED)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle loading and saving TIFF images.

`The JPEG library (libjpeg) (RECOMMENDED)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle loading JPEG images.

`The PNG library (libpng) (RECOMMENDED)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle loading PNG images.

`gif or ungif (OPTIONAL)'
     The GUI library uses either one of these libraries to load GIF
     images.

`aspell (OPTIONAL)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle spell checking.

`cups (OPTIONAL)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle interface to the CUPS print
     servers.

`audiofile (OPTIONAL)'
     The GUI library uses this for playing sound files.

`portaudio (OPTIONAL)'
     The GUI library uses this for the sound server.  Use v19, which has
     several API changes since the previous version. v19 hasn't
     actually been formally released, but several distributions (SuSE,
     etc) use it anyway.

`freetype2 (RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED for art backend)'
     This is used for font information. Freetype2 cache API is in flux.
     GNUstep tries to account for this, but if you get errors about
     undefined FTC_ symbols, you might be using an unsupported version
     of freetype.

`libart_lgpl2 (REQUIRED for art backend only)'
     Drawing library for the art backend.

`WindowMaker (Version >= 0.62) (OPTIONAL)'
     GNUstep and WindowMaker work together to provide a consistant
     interface.  Although it is not required, GNUstep will work much
     better if you use it with the WindowMaker window manager.  Get
     WindowMaker from `http://www.windowmaker.info'.

`gnustep-objc package (REQUIRED BUT ONLY for gcc version < 3.0 or MINGW/Cygwin)'
     Note: Do not install this library unless you are sure you need it.
     You probably don't need it except on MinGW and Cygwin (regardless
     of the gcc version you have).  This is a special version of the
     Objective-C runtime that is compiled as a shared library.  It is
     available at `ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/libs' which
     compiles using the GNUstep Makefile package (so you don't have to
     get the entire gcc dist). Make sure to set the THREADING variable
     in the GNUmakefile.  It's possible to compile the library static
     (make shared=no) and just copy to the place where the gcc libobjc
     library is (type gcc -v to get this location). Note you have to
     install gnustep-make (below) before installing this library.

`GDB (OPTIONAL)'
     GDB can be obtained from `ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb'. As of release
     6.0, gdb has special support for debugging Objective-C programs.

`TeX (OPTIONAL)'
     You need a TeX implementation, like tetex, to compile some of the
     documentation (although most of that is available on the web).

3 Compiling and Installing the packages
***************************************

Get the following individual packages:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

   See `http://www.gnustep.org' for information on where to get these
packages.

   Make sure you install (if necessary) all the previously mentioned
libraries first before configuring and building GNUstep.

   You should install these packages as root (read special note for the
gnustep-base library, below, if you cannot do this).

   For installation on specific systems, read the machine specific
instructions at the end of this document or appropriate README files in
the gnustep-make Documentation directory (such as README.MingW for
Windows).

3.1 Installing the Core Libraries
=================================

The GNUstep packages uses the Autoconf mechanism for configuration; it
checks some host capabilities which are used by all GNUstep software.
The first package you will compile is gnustep-make.  To configure
gnustep-make just type:

     ./configure

   The GNUstep makefile package can be configured to use different types
of filesystem layouts.  By default, GNUstep is installed with a GNUstep
filesystem layout into /usr/GNUstep.  That is a good, recommended
default if you don't have an opinion on which filesystem layout to use.

   But you can also install it somewhere else by using the prefix
parameter; the following command makes /usr/local/GNUstep the root
directory:

     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/GNUstep

   You can also install GNUstep using an FHS layout (or some other
filesystem layout of your choice) by using the with-layout parameter;
the following command configures GNUstep to use the standard FHS (unix)
filesystem layout:

     ./configure --with-layout=fhs

   In this document we will always present examples that assume that you
are using the default GNUstep filesystem layout in /usr/GNUstep.  If
you are using a different layout, you will need to make the obvious
changes.

3.1.1 Alternate Library Setup
-----------------------------

Read the installation instructions in the Makefile package (make) for
more installation options. Make sure you use the same configuration
options when configuring each GNUstep library.

3.1.2 Building the Package
--------------------------

To build the individual packages, use this familiar set of commands for
each pacakge (add any additional options you decide upon):

     ./configure
     make
     make install

   Start with the Makefile Package (gnustep-make). After installing
gnustep-make you need to execute GNUstep's shell configuration script,
as follows:

      . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

   before proceeding any further.

   NOTE for gcc 2.X or MinGW users: Now install gnustep-objc. Before
building gnustep-objc, edit the `GNUmakefile' and set the THREADING
variable to the thread library used on your system (usually its posix,
but you can leave it at single if you don't need threads). At this point
you should probably re-configure, make and install gnustep-make, so it
can pick up on any threading information that gnustep-objc provides.

   Now install gnustep-base, gnustep-gui and finally gnustep-back.

   NOTE: If you are trying to install the packages without root
permission, you may need to change one thing in the base library. Edit
the file gnustep-base/Tools/gdomap.h to uncomment the last line and
modify the specified port number to a port which you _know_ is not in
use on your network.  You should only do this if absolutely necessary
since making this change will break communications with any systems
where an identical change has not been made.  Also, the standard gdomap
port is the one officially registered with IANA and is reserved for use
by gdomap - it should only be changed if you can't get your system
administrator to start the gdomap server using it.

4 Additional Installation
*************************

4.1 Environment Setup
=====================

You need to make sure your environment is properly setup in order to
compile and run GNUstep software.  The steps to setup your environment
differ slightly depending on your filesystem layout.

   There is a way of setting up your environment that always works:
sourcing the `GNUstep.sh' shell script before using GNUstep.  The shell
script `GNUstep.sh' is located in the Makefile package; you may want to
add it to your shell startup file (such as `.profile'). For instance,
if you installed GNUstep with the default GNUstep filesystem layout in
`/usr/GNUstep', then adding

     . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

   in your `.profile' file will work (Note the period at the beginning
of the line, and the space between the period and the following path;
if you installed GNUstep somewhere else, you need to replace
`/usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles' with the path to your
`GNUstep.sh' script).  The script defines environment variables that
are needed to find GNUstep files and executables.

   Users of csh need to use the `GNUstep.csh' script. Read the make
package `README' for more info. Some systems, like GNU/Linux have an
`/etc/profile.d' directory where scripts can be executed automatically.
If you want to set up GNUstep for every user on your system, you can
try copying/linking the `GNUstep.sh' there. For csh or tcsh, try

     source /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.csh

   Finally, in most filesystem configuration it's also possible to
manually set up your environment by setting PATH, the linker library
paths and the `GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES' variable (instead of using
`GNUstep.sh').  For example, on GNU/Linux (with a default GNUstep
installation), instead of sourcing `GNUstep.sh' you could manually add
the Tools directories to your PATH:

     PATH="/usr/GNUstep/System/Tools:/usr/GNUstep/Local/Tools:$PATH"

   manually add `/usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries' and
`/usr/GNUstep/Local/Library/Libraries' to your `/etc/ld.so.conf' file
(don't forget to run `ldconfig' every time you install a library), and
set the environment variable `GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES' when you want to
compile something:

     GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES=/usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles

4.2 GNUstep Home
================

Your home GNUstep directory should be created automatically the first
time you use a GNUstep tool or application.  This is where user
defaults are kept as well as other user configuration files. User
installed apps, libraries, etc are also here (if the default user
directory is used).  By default this is the directory `GNUstep' under
your home directory, but you can change this (see the gnustep-make
installation documentation).

4.3 Time Zone
=============

In most cases, GNUstep should be able to determine your time zone, if
you have already set it up correctly when setting up your computer.
However, in some cases this might fail or the correct information may
not be available.  You can set it manually using the GNUstep defaults
utility to set `Local Time Zone' to your local time zone. Type
something like `defaults write NSGlobalDomain "Local Time Zone" GB'.
Where `GB' is a time zone abbreviation.

   See
`/usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Libraries/gnustep-base/Versions/1.14/Resources/NSTimeZones/zones/'
(or equivalent on your system depending on your filesystem layout) for
typical time zones.

4.4 GNUstep deamons
===================

Set up your system to execute some GNUstep deamons.  This is optional
because if you don't do this, they will be started automatically when
you run your first GNUstep app:

   * gdomap - Put this in a system startup file, like `/etc/rc.local'
     or `/etc/rc.d/rc.local' (customize for your system)
          if [ -f /usr/GNUstep/System/Tools/gdomap ]; then
            /usr/GNUstep/System/Tools/gdomap
          fi

   * gdnc - Start after sourcing `GNUstep.sh' (e.g. in .profile)

   * gpbs - Same as with gdnc, make sure X-Windows is running.

   * make_services - Not a deamon, but a tool that needs to be run
     everytime you install a new Application or service. This is NOT
     run automatically.

     if [ `gdomap -L GDNCServer | grep -c Unable` == 1 ]; then
       echo "Starting GNUstep services..."
       gdnc
       gpbs
     fi
     make_services

5 Test Tools and Applications
*****************************

Example applications are located in the gstep-examples package.  To
build these, just uncompress and untar this package, cd to the
appropriate directory, and type make. You will need to install the
GNUstep core libraries first before doing this.

   To run the examples. Use the openapp utility that is part of the
GNUstep makefile package (and stored in `/usr/GNUstep/System/Tools').
Usage is:

     openapp application_name [additional arguments to app]

   Good Luck!

6 Machine Specific Instructions
*******************************

\input texinfo

   Below is a list of machines that people have attempted to compile
GNUstep on. GNUstep compiles with little or no trouble on many of the
more popular operating systems. Some machines marked with _Unstable_
may have some trouble or may not work at all.  Platforms marked _Needs
Testing_ are not actively tested by developers and need someone to help
with reporting problems and fixes.  Platforms marked _Obsolete_ are
very old distributions. No one really knows if GNUstep works on these
although they may.

   If you have compiled GNUstep on a specific machine, please send
information about what you needed and any special instructions needed to
GNUstep <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.

6.1 Compilers
=============

A recommended compiler is listed for each machine, if known. You should
try to use the recommended compiler for compiling GNUstep, as GNUstep
is quite complex and tends provoke a lot of errors in some compilers.
Even versions newer than the listed compiler may not work, so don't
just get the latest version of a compiler expecting it to be better
than previous versions.

   Compiler notes: If a recommended compiler is not listed, take note
of the following information before choosing the compiler you use.
EGCS OR GCC < 2.95
     Most likely will not work and is not supported.

GCC 2.95.X
     Support for this compiler is deprecated as of Aug 2006. Mostly
     likely it will work in the near future and bug fixes will be
     accepted, but any bugs are considered non-critical.

GCC 2.96
     Not an official gcc release. Some versions (Redhat, Mandrake) have
     problems that prevent GNUstep from being compiled correctly and
     cause mysterious errors. Not supported.

GCC 3.0.X
     A fairly good compiler.

GCC 3.1
     Several bugs where introduced in the version. It's probably better
     to avoid this one, although it might work fine.

GCC 3.2.X
     Pretty good.

GCC 3.3.X
     Recommended. Fixes some bugs relating to protocols as well as other
     improvements.

GCC 3.4.X
     Recommended. The #import directive is no longer deprecated as of
     this version of the compiler.

GCC 4.0
     Probably OK. Did start triggering compiler errors on parts of
     base, but there has been a workaround in base for that. Does not
     work on MacOSX.

GCC 4.0.1
     Probably OK. This version should work on MacOSX.

GCC 4.1.X
     4.1.0 and 4.1.1 don't work if you use precompiled headers.

   If your having mysterious trouble with a machine, try compiling
GNUstep without optimization. Particularly in the newer GCC compilers,
optimization can break some code. The easiest way to do this is when
configuring, `CFLAGS="" ./configure'. Or when building, `make
OPTFLAG=""'.

   Also if you manually upgraded gcc and/or make, we recommend reading
the documentation at `http://www.LinuxFromScratch.org' for tips on
compiling and installing gcc and make. If you had GNUstep previously
installed, make sure you completely remove all of it, including
installed init scripts.

   Support Notes:
SUPPORTED
     Regularly used and tested by developers

RELEASE
     Tested before a release

UNSUPPORTED
     Not regularly used or tested

UNSTABLE
     Has problems either building or running GNUstep or requires special
     setp procedures to run correctly.

6.2 CentOS/ix86 (_Supported_)
=============================

This RedHat variant is well-tested and well-supported (tested at least
up to CentOS release 4.4).  For more information, please check the
section on RedHat/i386 below.

6.3 Darwin/ix86 (_Unsupported_)
===============================

Currently tested on Darwin 7.x

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     gcc 3.3.2 or greater 3.3.* versions.  Older versions will not
     compile on Darwin and 3.4.* versions don't support GNU runtime
     compilation on Darwin currently (The GCC bug report is
     http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11572).

     Default compiler (Apple GCC) has unknown problems.  Download the
     FSF GCC compiler and configure it with -enable-threads=posix. You
     don't need binutils or anything else.  Use the GNU runtime. Make
     sure to add
          export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc (use the correct path to FSF gcc)
     so that the correct compiler is found

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Use ffcall because libffi hasn't been ported to Darwin x86.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Read the `README.Darwin' file in the gnustep-make/Documentation
     directory for complete instructions.


6.4 Darwin/PowerPC (_Supported_)
================================

This section is for building the complete GNUstep system.  This system
will not interact at all with Mac OS X/Cocoa. It uses different
complilers, different display systems, etc. For building GNUstep
extensions to be used with Mac OS X (for instance, if you want to build
something based on GNUstep, such as GSWeb or GNUMail), see the
MacOSX/PowerPC section.

   Currently tested on Darwin 6.x, 7.x, 8.x

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     FSF gcc 4.x, gcc 3.3.2 or greater 3.3.* versions.  Older versions
     will not compile on Darwin and 3.4.* versions don't support GNU
     runtime compilation on Darwin currently (The GCC bug report is
     http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11572).

     Apple gcc with Mac OS X 10.4 or later and XCode 2.5 or later

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Use libffi (not ffcall). This should be enabled by default in
     gnustep-base so you don't have to type -enable-libffi. For 6.x,
     you need the dlcompat library (from `www.opendarwin.org') to load
     bundles (not needed for 7.x or later). libjpeg that comes with
     fink conflicts with the Apple libraries and screw up other apps on
     Mac OSX (like X11).

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Read the `README.Darwin' file in the gnustep-make/Documentation
     directory for complete instructions. If you compiled FSF gcc by
     hand, make sure to rename to GNU libobjc library to
     libobjc-gnu.dylib


   See also the MacOSX/PowerPC section

6.5 Debian/Alpha (_Unsupported_)
================================

6.6 Debian/i386 (_Supported_)
=============================

Tested on sid.

6.7 Debian/em64t (_Supported_)
==============================

Tested on 'unstable'.

6.8 Debian/PowerPC (_Supported_)
================================

Tested on sid.

6.9 Debian/SPARC (_Release_)
============================

Tested on sid.

6.10 FedoraCore/ix86 (_Supported_)
==================================

This RedHat variant is well-tested and well-supported (tested at least
up to Fedora Core release 6).  For more information, please check the
section on RedHat/i386 below.

6.11 FreeBSD 5.x (_Supported_)
==============================

Tested on 5.0, 5.1, 5.3
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Can install via /usr/ports/devel/gnustep, but not all required
     dependancies are installed. See the GNUstep-HOWTO for list of
     libraries.

     For 5.3, there is a bug in libkvm that requires that /proc be
     mounted. Use 'mount_procfs proc /proc' or see the procfs man page.

6.12 FreeBSD 4.x (_Unsupported_)
================================

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     For gcc 3.0.4, make WANT_THREADS_SUPPORT=YES

     For libxml2 2.4.24, make WITHOUT_PYTHON=YES


6.13 FreeBSD 3.x  (_Obsolete_)
==============================

Compiles "out of the box" on FreeBSD 3.4.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     You need to use gmake not make to compile the GNUstep packages. A
     special port of gdb can be used with the Objective-C patches from
     `ftp://ftp.pcnet.com/users/eischen/FreeBSD/gdb-4.17-port.tar.gz'

     The best compiler for GNUstep is the latest release of the GNU
     Compiler Collection (GCC).  You can find it at
     `http://egcs.cygnus.com/'.

     If you want to use the native POSIX threads support from `libc_r'
     pass `--enable-threads=posix' to configure.  This is the
     recommended option as this is the FreeBSD threads package that
     gives the best results -with others you may be unable to run some
     examples like `diningPhilosophers'.

     The whole compilation process can fail if you have another threads
     library installed so watch out for installed packages like `pth'
     and such.  Besides the support for libc_r, GNUstep will also look
     for `pth' and `pcthreads', so if you have installed them and they
     aren't detected prepare to write a nice bug report.

     This can be done more much easily by using the port version.  Just
     `cd' to `/usr/ports/lang/egcs' and do a `"make WANT_THREADS=yes
     install"'.  Easy.

     If configure cannot find tiff.h or the tiff library and you have
     it installed in a non-standard place (even `/usr/local'), you may
     need to pass these flags to configure:
     `CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"' and `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"'.


6.14 FreeBSD 2.x (_Obsolete,Unstable_)
======================================

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Only static libraries work on this system.  Use /stand/sysinstall
     to install these packages if you have not already done so:

     gmake           (GNU make)
     gcc 2.8.x

     Seems to compile ok, but some tests crash. Possibly due to a
     performace 'hack' in base. Might be a good idea to upgrade to
     FreeBSD 3.x.  You need to use gmake not make to compile the
     GNUstep packages.


6.15 Gentoo/i686 (_Supported_)
==============================

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     libffi sometimes causes odd problems. Try to use ffcall.

6.16 Gentoo/PPC (_Supported_)
=============================

6.17 Gentoo/amd64 (_Unsupported_)
=================================

32-bit mode only?

6.18 Gentoo/alpha (_Unsupported_)
=================================

6.19 Gentoo/sparc (_Unsupported_)
=================================

6.20 Irix 6.5/MIPS (_Unsupported_)
==================================

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     gcc 3.2.1

     To use threads, it's necessary to bootstrap a compiler yourself:
     configure with -enable-threads=posix, that will work as long as you
     link EVERY objective C executable with -lpthread, no matter what
     warnings the irix linker produces!

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Unknown

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     If you cannot link the library because of the very low default
     limit (20480) for the command line length, then you should either
     use systune ncargs to increase the value (maximum is 262144) or
     link the library by hand.  No libffi-support: Use ffcall


6.21 MacOSX/PowerPC (_Release_)
===============================

This section is for building the GNUstep extensions only.  Use this if,
for instance, if you want to build something based on GNUstep, such as
GSWeb or GNUMail. If you want to build the complete GNUstep system
independant of Mac OS X, see the Darwin/PowerPC section.

   Currently tested on MacOSX 10.1.5, 10.2, 10.3

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Default. For 10.1.5, you need to add -no-cpp-precomp to CFLAGS
     (For instance, ./configure CFLAGS="-no-cpp-precomp" ...)

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     None.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Warning ! To know how to install a complete GNUstep system on Mac
     OS X, read the Darwin/PowerPC section.  By default, on Mac OS X,
     only the GNUstep extensions are built. Read the `README.Darwin'
     file in the gnustep-make/Documentation directory for complete
     instructions.

     To build the GNUstep extensions only is useful, when you want to
     build on Mac OS X, GNUstep related projects like gdl2, etc linked
     to Cocoa.  Xcode project files exist, but they may not be
     up-to-date. Make sure /usr/sbin is in your path:

          PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin

     Then type:

          cd make
          ./configure --with-library-combo=apple-apple-apple
          make install
          . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
          cd ../base
          ./configure --with-xml-prefix=/usr --disable-xmltest
          make debug=yes install

     On Mac OS X 10.1.5, there is no libxml. Either install libxml2 or
     configure base with -disable-xml.

   See also the Darwin/PowerPC section.

6.22 MkLinux/PowerPC (_Unsupported_)
====================================

Tested with R2 RC2 (2004/03/04).

6.23 NetBSD/i386 (_Release_)
============================

Tested on NetBSD 2.0.2 (2005/04/15)

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Standard

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     libiconv(?), libffi

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Use NetBSD packages to install needed libraries. libffi either
     comes automatically with gcc or can be installed separately and
     works fine (over ffcall).


6.24 NetBSD/Sparc64  (_Unstable_)
=================================

Tested on NetBSD 2.0.2 (2005/04/15)

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Standard

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     libiconv(?), libffi

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Use NetBSD packages to install needed libraries. libffi either
     comes automatically with gcc or can be installed separately and is
     prefered over ffcall which does not work on Sparc64 machines.


   gdomap crashes. Perhaps other things do not work as well.

6.25 Netwinder (_Unstable_)
===========================

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Build #12 of the system.

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Unknown

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     See `http://www.netwinder.org/~patrix'

6.26 OpenBSD 3.9  (_Unsupported_)
=================================

Information for version 3.9 (2006/08/13)

   Ports at `http://mail.rochester.edu/~asveikau/gnustep-openbsd/'

6.27 OSF/Alpha  (_Needs Testing, Unstable_)
===========================================

Information is for Version 3.2C

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Unknown

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Unknown

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Can only compile with static libraries. Compiler may fail when
     linking executables (e.g. gdnc). Standard ranlib and ar programs
     are to feable to create libraries. Should use GNU binutils
     versions. Linker sometimes fails to find symbols, in which case
     you may need to link with a library twice. For instance, add an
     extra -lgnustep-gui in ADDTIONAL_TOOL_LIBS in the
     GNUmakefile(.preamble).


6.28 RedHat/i386 (_Supported_)
==============================

RedHat and variants/clones such as Fedora Core and CentOS are all very
well supported and are regularly tested with all GNUstep releases.

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     The default compiler works very well.

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     All extra libs needed are easily available from standard packages;
     the only tricky one is ffcall.  If you don't find an RPM for that
     one, download it directly from the GNUstep web site
     (http://www.gnustep.org).

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     None.


6.29 Slackware/Intel (_Unsupported_)
====================================

6.30 Slackware/Sparc (Splack) (_Unsupported_)
=============================================

Tested with Spalck 8.0 (2005/03/01)

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     gcc 3.2, no extra options.

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Unknown.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Tested on an ultra sparc server, kernel 2.4.27, XF86-4.0.3


6.31 Solaris 2.5.1/Sparc (_Obsolete_)
=====================================

This configuration is no longer being tested, but it may still work.

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Unknown

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     tiff, Don't use the one in /usr/openwin

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     See the Solaris 2.6 section for more instructions.

6.32 Solaris 2.[678]/Sparc (_Supported_)
========================================

Tested on Solaris version 6, 7, 8 and 9

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     gcc 3.2.1 or greater gcc 3.04. Not 3.1 - does not compile parts of
     GNUstep.

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     tiff, Don't use the one in /usr/openwin

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Using a POSIX shell (zsh or bash, which should come with Solaris)
     is highly recommended. In fact, some functions, such as compiling
     frameworks, will not work without it.


   Some people have reported problems when using binutils assembler and
linker.  Using the native Solaris assmebler and linker should work fine.

   Older Instructions: If you are using threads, make sure the
Objective-C runtime (libobjc that comes with gcc) is compiled with
threads enabled (This is true by default) AND that it is compiled with
the _REENTRANT flag defined (This does not seem to be true by default).
Or use the gnustep-objc package. Also make sure THREADS is set to
'posix' not 'solaris'.

6.33 Solaris 2.7/Intel (_Unsupported_)
======================================

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Unknown.

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Unknown

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Make sure there are no -g compiler flags (i.e. compiling with
     debug=yes might be a problem). Unsure of correct bundle flags -
     You might need to use the alternate flags listed in target.make,
     line 989. Also, configuring gnustep-make with
     `--disable-backend-bundle' might be necessary if you can't get
     bundles to work.  You will probable get a lot of text relocation
     warnings, which probably can be ignored. See the other Solaris
     instructions above for more information.


6.34 Suse 6.x/Intel (_Obsolete_)
================================

GNUstep has been tested on version 6.2-6.4 of Suse

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Standard

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     None

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     It seems that there is a problem with the default kernel build
     distributed with Suse  which means that the socket binding used by
     gdnc doesn't work.  If you recompile the kernel then it starts
     working.


6.35 Suse/Intel (_Supported_)
=============================

GNUstep has been tested on version 7.0, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 9.0, 9.1, 9.3,
10.1, 11.0

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     The default compiler that comes with Susu is fine.  Compile with
     -threads-enabled (non-standard).

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     None

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Suse 10.1 does not work with the x11 backend.


6.36 Suse 7.x/PPC (_Unsupported_)
=================================

GNUstep has been tested on version 7.0 of Suse/PPC

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Standard. gcc2.95.x, gcc3.0.x and gc3.1 work, but 2.95 is faster.
     Compile with -threads-enabled (non-standard).

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     None

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS

6.37 Unixware-2.1.3/Intel (_Unsupported_)
=========================================

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     Unknown

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Unknown


   Special Instructions for GNUstep installation on Unixware 2.1 systems

1
     Tune the kernel to increase the argument space so that we can pass
     long command-line argument strings to processes (which the
     makefiles do) (/etc/conf/bin/idtune ARG_MAX 102400)

2
     Install raft of the latest GNU software

     gzip            (you need this to unpack other stuff)
     make            (to build everything)
     m4              (for autoconf etc)
     autoconf        (if you need to change anything)
     bison
     flex
     binutils        (required by gcc if you want to debug)
     gcc-2.8.1
                     (configure -with-gnu-as -with-gnu-ld -with-stabs)
                     NB. gcc-2.8.1 needs a fix to __do_global_dtors_aux()
                     in crtstuff.c on Unixware 2.1.3
                     (and possibly other unixware versions)
                     The fix is already in recent versions of egcs.

          ==================================
          static void
          __do_global_dtors_aux ()
          {
            static func_ptr *p = __DTOR_LIST__ + 1;
            static int completed = 0;

            if (completed)
              return;

            while (*p)
              {
                p++;
                (*(p-1)) ();
              }

          #ifdef EH_FRAME_SECTION_ASM_OP
            __deregister_frame_info (__EH_FRAME_BEGIN__);
          #endif
            completed = 1;
          }
          ======================================

3
     Having got gcc working - it's probably a good idea to rebuild all
     your GNU software using it!

4
     Build gstep as normal.

5
     The SIOCGIFCONF ioctl sometimes doesn't work on unixware after
     applying some of the OS patches.

     So I have added a '-a' flag to gdomap to give it the name of a file
     containing IP address and netmask information for the network
     interfaces on the system.

     You need to set up a file (I suggest '/etc/gdomap_addresses')
     containing the information for your machine and modify your system
     startup files in /etc/rc?.d to run gdomap, telling it to use that
     file.

     eg. If your machine has an IP address of '193.111.111.2' and is on
     a class-C network, your /etc/gdomap_addresses file would contain
     the line

          193.111.111.2 255.255.255.0

     and your startup file would contain the lines

          . /usr/local/GNUstep/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
          gdomap -a /etc/gdomap_addresses


   If you don't set gdomap up correctly, Distributed Objects will not
work.

6.38 Windows with CYGWIN (_Unsupported_)
========================================

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     gcc 3.3.1 or later (with libobjc and libjava (if using libffi))

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     Objective-C library DLL
     (`ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/windows/cygwin') for shared
     libs. It's a good idea to remove the libobjc.a that comes with gcc
     (gcc -v for location) so that it isn't accidentally found.  For
     ffcall, you should get version 1.8b or above (the earlier ones
     don't compile). There are still some problems with structure
     passing, but that is generally not supported on any architecture.
     libffi also works.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     Make sure you have good shared libraries for everthing. Sometimes
     a bad shared library (like libtiff) will cause odd and untraceable
     problems.  See `README.Cygwin' for information on compiling.


6.39 Windows with MinGW (_Supported_)
=====================================

RECOMMENDED COMPILER
     See below.

EXTRA LIBS NEEDED
     See below.

SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS
     See the `README.MinGW' file located in the gnustep-make
     Documentation directory for instructions. Windows NT/2000/XP only.
     Win98 machines and earlier are very buggy and are not supported.
     Native GUI backend is alpha version.

6.40 Yellowdog/PowerPC (_Unsupported_)
======================================

7 Getting Libraries via SVN
***************************

If you didn't get one of the snapshots, or if you want to be sure to
stay on the bleading edge, then you should get the libraries via SVN. Go
to `http://www.gnustep.org/resources/sources.html' for information on
how to get the sourcecode.

   If you haven't already done so, change to the directory, where you
want the source to reside. To checkout all of the GNUstep repository,
type
     svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/gnustep/modules

   To check out only the `core', which contains all the GNUstep core
libraries:
     svn co http://svn.gna.org/svn/gnustep/modules/core

   After you have checked out the source you can compile it as usual.
To update the source, go into the directory of the source tree you want
to update, for example, go into 'base', and type:

     svn update

   You don't have to re-checkout after you have the source, just update!
