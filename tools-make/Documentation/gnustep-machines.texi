This list is out-of-date.  Use the Platform_compatibility guide on the
GNUstep Wiki for better information.

Below is a list of machines that people have attempted to compile
GNUstep on. GNUstep compiles with little or no trouble on many of the
more popular operating systems. Some machines marked with
@emph{Unstable} may have some trouble or may not work at all.
Platforms marked @emph{Needs Testing} are not actively tested by developers
and need someone to help with reporting problems and fixes.
Platforms marked @emph{Obsolete} are very old distributions. No one really
knows if GNUstep works on these although they may.

If you have compiled GNUstep on a specific machine, please send information
about what you needed and any special instructions needed to
GNUstep @email{bug-gnustep@@gnu.org}.

@section Compilers

A recommended compiler is listed for each machine, if known. You should try
to use the recommended compiler for compiling GNUstep, as GNUstep is quite
complex and tends provoke a lot of errors in some compilers. Even versions
newer than the listed compiler may not work, so don't just get the latest
version of a compiler expecting it to be better than previous versions.

Compiler notes: If a recommended compiler is not listed, take note of the
following information before choosing the compiler you use.
@table @var
@item egcs or gcc < 2.95
Most likely will not work and is not supported.
@item gcc 2.95.x
Support for this compiler is deprecated as of Aug 2006. Mostly likely
it will work in the near future and bug fixes will be accepted, but any
bugs are considered non-critical.
@item gcc 2.96
Not an official gcc release. Some versions (Redhat, Mandrake) have problems
that prevent GNUstep from being compiled correctly and cause
mysterious errors. Not supported.
@item gcc 3.0.x
A fairly good compiler. 
@item gcc 3.1
Several bugs where introduced in the version. It's probably better to
avoid this one, although it might work fine.
@item gcc 3.2.x
Pretty good. 
@item gcc 3.3.x
Recommended. Fixes some bugs relating to protocols as well as other
improvements.
@item gcc 3.4.x
Recommended. The #import directive is no longer deprecated as of this
version of the compiler.
@item gcc 4.0
Probably OK. Did start triggering compiler errors on parts of base, but
there has been a workaround in base for that. Does not work on MacOSX.
@item gcc 4.0.1
Probably OK. This version should work on MacOSX.
@item gcc 4.1.x
4.1.0 and 4.1.1 don't work if you use precompiled headers.
@end table

If your having mysterious trouble with a machine, try compiling GNUstep
without optimization. Particularly in the newer GCC compilers,
optimization can break some code. The easiest way to do this is when
configuring, @kbd{CFLAGS="" ./configure}. Or when building, 
@kbd{make OPTFLAG=""}.

Also if you manually upgraded gcc and/or make, we recommend reading the
documentation at @url{http://www.LinuxFromScratch.org} for tips on compiling
and installing gcc and make. If you had GNUstep previously installed, make sure
you completely remove all of it, including installed init scripts.

Support Notes:
@table @var
@item Supported
Regularly used and tested by developers
@item Release
Tested before a release
@item Unsupported
Not regularly used or tested
@item Unstable
Has problems either building or running GNUstep or requires special
setp procedures to run correctly.

Currently tested on Darwin 7.x

@table @var
@item Recommended compiler
gcc 3.3.2 or greater 3.3.* versions. 
Older versions will not compile on Darwin and 3.4.* versions don't 
support GNU runtime compilation on Darwin currently (The GCC bug report 
is http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11572).

Default compiler (Apple GCC) has unknown problems.
Download the FSF GCC compiler and configure it with
-enable-threads=posix. You don't need binutils or anything else.
Use the GNU runtime. Make sure to add 
@example
export CC=/usr/local/bin/gcc (use the correct path to FSF gcc)
@end example
so that the correct compiler is found

@item Extra libs needed 

Use ffcall because libffi hasn't been ported to Darwin x86.

This section is for building the complete GNUstep system.
This system will not interact at all with Mac OS X/Cocoa. It uses different
complilers, different display systems, etc. For building GNUstep extensions
to be used with Mac OS X (for instance, if you want to build something based
on GNUstep, such as GSWeb or GNUMail), see the MacOSX/PowerPC section.

Currently tested on Darwin 6.x, 7.x, 8.x

@table @var
@item Recommended compiler
FSF gcc 4.x, gcc 3.3.2 or greater 3.3.* versions. 
Older versions will not compile on Darwin and 3.4.* versions don't 
support GNU runtime compilation on Darwin currently (The GCC bug report 
is http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11572).

Apple gcc with Mac OS X 10.4 or later and XCode 2.5 or later

@item Extra libs needed 
Use libffi (not ffcall). This should be enabled by default in gnustep-base
so you don't have to type --enable-libffi. For 6.x, you need the dlcompat 
library (from @url{www.opendarwin.org}) to load bundles (not needed for 7.x
or later). libjpeg that comes with fink conflicts with the Apple libraries
and screw up other apps on Mac OSX (like X11).

@item Special Instructions 

Read the @url{README.Darwin} file in the gnustep-make/Documentation
directory for complete instructions. If you compiled FSF gcc by hand,
make sure to rename to GNU libobjc library to libobjc-gnu.dylib

@section FreeBSD 3.x  (@emph{Obsolete})

Compiles "out of the box" on FreeBSD 3.4.

@table @var
@item Special Instructions 
You need to use gmake not make to compile the GNUstep packages. A special
port of gdb can be used with the Objective-C patches from
@url{ftp://ftp.pcnet.com/users/eischen/FreeBSD/gdb-4.17-port.tar.gz}

The best compiler for GNUstep is the latest release of the GNU Compiler
Collection (GCC).  You can find it at @url{http://egcs.cygnus.com/}.

If you want to use the native POSIX threads support from @file{libc_r} pass
@code{--enable-threads=posix} to configure.  This is the recommended option as 
this is the FreeBSD threads package that gives the best results --with others
you may be unable to run some examples like @file{diningPhilosophers}.

The whole compilation process can fail if you have another threads library
installed so watch out for installed packages like @file{pth} and such.
Besides the support for libc_r, GNUstep will also look for @file{pth} and
@file{pcthreads}, so if you have installed them and they aren't detected
prepare to write a nice bug report.

This can be done more much easily by using the port version.  Just @code{cd}
to @file{/usr/ports/lang/egcs} and do a @code{"make WANT_THREADS=yes install"}.
Easy.

If configure cannot find tiff.h or the tiff library and you have it installed
in a non-standard place (even @file{/usr/local}), you may need to pass these
flags to configure: @code{CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"} and
@code{LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"}.

Default. For 10.1.5, you need to add -no-cpp-precomp to CFLAGS
(For instance, ./configure CFLAGS="-no-cpp-precomp" ...)

@item Extra libs needed 
None.

@item Special Instructions
Warning ! To know how to install a complete GNUstep system on Mac OS X, 
read the Darwin/PowerPC section.
By default, on Mac OS X, only the GNUstep extensions are built. Read the @url{README.Darwin} file in the gnustep-make/Documentation directory for
complete instructions.

To build the GNUstep extensions only is useful, when you want to build 
on Mac OS X, GNUstep related projects like gdl2, etc linked to Cocoa. 
Xcode project files exist, but they may not be up-to-date. Make sure 
/usr/sbin is in your path:

@example
PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
@end example

Then type:

@example
cd make
./configure --with-library-combo=apple-apple-apple
make install
. /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
cd ../base
./configure --with-xml-prefix=/usr --disable-xmltest
make debug=yes install

On Mac OS X 10.1.5, there is no libxml. Either install libxml2
or configure base with --disable-xml.

Some people have reported problems when using binutils assembler and linker.
Using the native Solaris assmebler and linker should work fine.

Older Instructions:
If you are using threads, make sure the Objective-C runtime (libobjc that comes
with gcc) is compiled with threads enabled (This is true by default) AND that
it is compiled with the _REENTRANT flag defined (This does not seem to be
true by default). Or use the gnustep-objc package. Also make sure THREADS is

Having got gcc working - it's probably a good idea to rebuild 
all your GNU software using it!

@item   4
Build gstep as normal.

The SIOCGIFCONF ioctl sometimes doesn't work on unixware after applying
some of the OS patches.

So I have added a '-a' flag to gdomap to give it the name of a file
containing IP address and netmask information for the network interfaces
on the system.

You need to set up a file (I suggest '/etc/gdomap_addresses') containing
the information for your machine and modify your system startup files in
/etc/rc?.d to run gdomap, telling it to use that file.

eg. If your machine has an IP address of '193.111.111.2' and is on a
class-C network, your /etc/gdomap_addresses file would contain the line

@example
193.111.111.2 255.255.255.0
@end example

and your startup file would contain the lines

@example
. /usr/local/GNUstep/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
gdomap -a /etc/gdomap_addresses
@end example

@end table

If you don't set gdomap up correctly, Distributed Objects will not
work.

@section Windows with CYGWIN (@emph{Unsupported})

@table @var
@item Recommended compiler
gcc 3.3.1 or later (with libobjc and libjava (if using libffi))

@item Extra libs needed 
Objective-C library DLL (@url{ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/windows/cygwin})
for shared libs. It's a good idea to remove the libobjc.a that comes with gcc
(gcc -v for location) so that it isn't accidentally found.
For ffcall, you should get version 1.8b or above (the earlier ones don't
compile). There are still some problems with structure passing, but that is
generally not supported on any architecture.  libffi also works.

@item Special Instructions

Make sure you have good shared libraries for everthing. Sometimes a bad
shared library (like libtiff) will cause odd and untraceable problems.
See @url{README.Cygwin} for information on compiling.
