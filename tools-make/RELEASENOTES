1 GNUstep Make Release Notes
****************************

The release notes include descriptions of API changes, behavior changes
and other information that might help developers and users migrate to
using a newer version of the make system.

1.1 Version 2.8.0
=================

We now include better library combo and ABI detection: gnustep-make will
now attempt to detect the optimal library combo and ABI supported by the
installed compiler and Objective-C runtime library.  Explicit selection
of the runtime ABI is now possible using the '--with-runtime-abi'
configure option.

   There's now full support for the gnustep-2.0 Objective-C ABI.

   This release includes support for creating a Git tag and creating a
tarball from a git tag using the 'git-tag' and 'git-dist' targets.

   This release includes support for creating a Mercurial tag and
creating a tarball from a hg tag using the 'hg-tag' and 'hg-dist'
targets.

   We have dropped legacy Rhapsody and FreeBSD-out support.

1.2 Version 2.7.0
=================

When building non-flattened, the subdirectory name for
libraries/binaries is changed for Debian compatibility (and simplicity)
to use a directory whose name is of the form architecture/library-combo
rather than nested directories of the form cpu/os-abi/library-combo.
The architecture name format is a sanitised triplet cpu-os-abi (where
previously we had cpu/os-abi).

   When building non-flattened, header files are now installed in an
architecture and library-combo dependent subdirectory in the same way
that binary libraries are installed.  This removes an inconsistency and
makes sense with Debian multiarch support which puts headers in an
architecture specific subdirectory.

   The long since deprecated GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR is removed.

   Various bugfixes and minor improvements.

1.3 Version 2.6.8
=================

Configure option '-with-library-combo=ng-gnu-gnu' to use the 'Next
Generation' setup of the latest ObjectiveC-2 runtime and compiler
features rather than traditional runtime.  Requires the new runtime and
a recent clang compiler.

   With the 'ng' runtime in use, you can define GS_WITH_ARC=1 at the
start of a makefile, or in your environment, or in the command line
arguments to have objC code built using ARC.

   Command line option 'documentation=no' to suppress builds of
documentation.

   Integration of testsuite for regression/unit testing of libraries
using the 'check' target.  In your makefile define libraryname_TEST_DIR
= TestsSubdirectory

   Various minor bugfixes, documentation spelling corrections etc.

   The '-enable-strict-v2-mode' option is now, after eight years, turned
on by default (in anticipation of finally removing backward
compatibility with version one).  WARNING; Packagers please ensure that
you update any old gnustep-make version one makefiles.

   Garbage collection support to be removed at the next release.

1.4 Version 2.6.7
=================

Improved package building support

   Improved environment variable support

   Improved Java support

   Various minor bugfixes, documentation spelling corrections etc.

1.5 Version 2.6.6
=================

Debian packagge generation support added.

   Bug fixes

1.6 Version 2.6.5
=================

Bugfix for non-fragile ABI test

   Bugfix order if include diorectories for system includes

   Bugfix equality test for prorocol testing

   Added minimal test support for .c and .cc files.

1.7 Version 2.6.4
=================

Test framework enhancement (extended equality tests)

   Android build target

1.8 Version 2.6.3
=================

Bug fixes

1.9 Version 2.6.2
=================

'Added standalone filesystem layout for putting everything in'
     one directory for easy deployment of relocatable

'Other bug fixes'

1.10 Version 2.6.1
==================

Bug fixes

1.11 Version 2.6.0
==================

'The default filesystem layout is now the 'fhs' layout'
     Before version 2.6.0, the default filesystem layout was the
     'gnustep' layout.  Starting with 2.6.0, the default filesystem
     layout has changed and is now the 'fhs' layout.  To get the old
     default layout, configure gnustep-make using ./configure
     -with-layout=gnustep.  Note that this change does not affect
     gnustep-make when used with the apple-apple-apple library combo, in
     which case the default filesystem layout remains the 'apple' one.

     The change in the default filesystem layout means that the location
     of the GNUstep.sh file in a default installation has changed from
     /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh to
     /usr/local/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh.  If you use the
     default layout and execute the GNUstep.sh script on startup, you
     need to change the command from

          . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

     to

          . /usr/local/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

'The default location of the configuration file changed'
     Before version 2.6.0, the configuration file was always by default
     /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf no matter what filesystem layout and
     prefix were used.  Starting with version 2.6.0, that is the default
     location of the configuration file only when installing
     system-wide, that is with a prefix set to /, /usr or /usr/GNUstep.
     In all other cases, the configuration file is by default located in
     $prefix/etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf.

     In particular, this means that if ./configure is invoked with no
     options specified, the default location of the configuration file
     is now /usr/local/etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf (and no longer
     /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf).

     Please note that the -with-config-file=xxx option allow you to
     specify whatever location for the configuration file that you want;
     the default is only used if no such option is specified and
     gnustep-make has to pick a reasonable default location for the
     configuration file.

     Finally, also note that the default location of the configuration
     file on Darwin has not changed and is still
     /Library/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf regardless of the prefix selected.

'Removed the --with-system-root, --with-local-root and --with-network-root options'
     These configure options were obsolete and are ignored by all
     releases in the past 4 years and have now finally been removed.

'Removed obsolete variables'
     Some very old variables that were deprecated 4 years ago have now
     been removed.  This includes xxx_RESOURCE_FILES_INSTALL_DIR in
     resource-set.make (you should use xxx_INSTALL_DIR instead) and
     GNUSTEP_GSWAPPS in gswapp.make (you should use GNUSTEP_WEB_APPS
     instead).

'New Test Framework'
     GNUstep-make now includes a test framework that can be used to
     easily write testcases for Objective-C software.  The new releases
     of GNUstep-base and GNUstep-gui include regression test suites that
     use this test framework.  Please check the README in the
     TestFramework directory for more information on how it works or how
     to use it.

'objc.make is deprecated'
     The file objc.make, which is used to compile Objective-C
     command-line tools without a Foundation library such as GNUstep
     base, is now deprecated.  Please use tool.make instead.

'--enable-absolute-install-paths is now the default on Darwin'
     This makes it easier to use GNUstep with the gnu-gnu-gnu library
     combo on Apple Mac OS X.

1.12 Version 2.4.0
==================

'You can enable the use of the non-fragile ivar ABI'
     The -enable-objc-nonfragile-abi flag can be used to enable the
     non-fragile ivar ABI for compilers (such as clang) that support it.

'-Wall is now used by default unless 'make warn=no' is specified'
     Before version 2.4.0, 'make debug=yes' would not only build object
     files particularly suited for debugging, but would also add the
     -Wall flag on the compiler command line when compiling
     C/ObjC/C++/ObjC++.  Starting with 2.4.0, the -Wall flag is
     controlled by a separate warn flag, so you can turn it on and off
     indipendentely by doing 'make warn=yes' or 'make warn=no'.  Since
     warn=yes is the default, the default behaviour also changed;
     starting with 2.4.0, gnustep-make will use -Wall by default.  You
     can turn it off by using 'make warn=no'.

     A similar change occurred for Java compilations, where the flag
     -deprecation, which used to be enabled by debug=yes, is now enabled
     by warn=yes.  As a consequence, Java code is now compiled by
     default with the -deprecation flag.  You can turn it off by
     compiling with 'make warn=no'.

'PACKAGE_NEEDS_CONFIGURE and JAVADOC_BUILD_ALWAYS now support 'yes' and 'no''
     gnustep-make boolean variables traditionally use the values 'yes'
     and 'no', with the unfortunate exception of PACKAGE_NEEDS_CONFIGURE
     and JAVADOC_BUILD_ALWAYS which used to only recognize the values
     'YES' and 'NO'. For consistency with everything else, starting with
     gnustep-make 2.4.0 these two variables recognize the values 'yes'
     and 'no' too.

'Versions of GNU make older then 3.79.1 (June 2000) are no longer supported'
     The .NOTPARALLEL pseudo-target is only available in GNU make 3.79
     and is essential for parallel builds to work.  Starting with
     version 2.4.0, gnustep-make recommends using GNU make 3.79.1 or
     greater; a warning will be issued during configure if an older GNU
     make is detected.  Older versions of GNU make are likely to work
     (except for parallel building) but are no longer supported.  As
     3.79.1 was released about 10 years ago, this should not be a
     particular problem.

'new internalmessages=yes option'
     Starting with version 2.4.0, gnustep-make recognized the new
     internalmessages=yes option (separate from messages=yes) which
     prints all the recursive make invocations that are used.  This is
     mostly useful to understand how gnustep-make internally works and
     is not meant for end-users.

'javadoc is run in quiet mode'
     Starting with version 2.4.0, javadoc is by default executed with
     the -quiet option (unless messages=yes is specified), and a
     "Generating javadoc documentation..."  is printed instead.

'new API to build subdirectories'
     Before version 2.4.0, aggregate.make was used to step into
     subdirectories and build them.  It did not support parallel
     building.  Starting with version 2.4.0, two new makefile fragments
     have been introduced: serial-subdirectories.make and
     parallel-subdirectories.make.  These can be used to build
     subdirectories, and encourage (indeed, force) the developer to
     explicitly decide if the subdirectories are to be built serially,
     or in parallel.

     Using parallel-subdirectories.make often produces massively faster
     builds (or installs or cleans) during a parallel build on a
     multicore machine.  But if you use parallel-subdirectories.make,
     you need to make sure the different subdirectories are completely
     independent of each other.  The operations that are executed in
     parallel are 'all', 'clean', 'distclean', 'check' and 'strings'.
     'install' and 'uninstall' are still executed in serial order to
     prevent any concurrency problems when creating (or removing) common
     installation directories.

     aggregate.make is still available if you want or need to be
     backwards-compatible with older versions of gnustep-make.  It is
     normally a wrapper around serial-subdirectories.make, but if you
     specify 'GNUSTEP_USE_PARALLEL_AGGREGATE = yes' in your GNUmakefile,
     it becomes a wrapper around parallel-subdirectories.make.
     aggregate.make will be deprecated in 2012 and removed in 2015, but
     for the next couple of years it might be a good solution while you
     wait for your users to upgrade their gnustep-make installations.

'each instance stores object files in its own subdirectory'
     Before version 2.4.0, there was a single object directory where all
     object files where stored.  In the most common case, this directory
     was simply ./obj, so if you compiled file source.m, you'd end up
     with ./obj/source.m.o.  Starting with version 2.4.0, different
     instances store their object files in different subdirectories; for
     example, if the file was compiled as part of tool ToolA, it would
     end up in ./obj/ToolA.obj/source.m.o, while if compiled as part of
     ToolB, it would end up in ./obj/ToolB.obj/source.m.o.  This allows
     ToolA and ToolB to be built in parallel with no race conditions,
     even if they share some source files.  There are a number of side
     effects of this change.  First of all, in the unlikely event that
     your GNUmakefile depends on the location of the object files (bad
     idea by the way), you'll have to update it.  Second, if you are
     reusing a single source file in multiple instances in the same
     project, this will now be compiled multiple times instead of one
     (on the plus side, you can fully parallelize the build by just
     using 'make -j N', without having to change anything in your
     GNUmakefile.  On a machine with multiple cpus/cores this can
     massively speed up the build).  Finally, the rules to compile
     C/ObjC/C++/ObjC++/Windres files are no longer available in the
     Master invocation - they are only available when compiling a
     specific instance.  It's hard to imagine a situation where this
     change of private internals would affect any user; but people with
     their own private gnustep-make forks or advanced extensions might
     be affected.

'the order in which instances are built is no longer guaranteed'
     If you build more than one tool in the same GNUmakefile by listing
     them all in TOOL_NAME as in "TOOL_NAME = ToolA ToolB', you need to
     be aware that the way the instances are built changed in version
     2.4.0.

     This change affects applications, bundles, ctools, clibraries,
     libraries, services, palettes, test-applications, test-libraries,
     test-tools, tools.  It does not affect Java, resource sets or
     documentation.  [FIXME: frameworks ?]

     Before version 2.4.0, instances were always built one after the
     other one, exactly in the order specified.  So, in the example
     ToolA would be built before ToolB. Starting with 2.4.0, the
     instances might be built completely in parallel if parallel
     building is enabled.  So, the order in which they are built is no
     longer defined and your GNUmakefile should not depend on the order
     in which instances are specified in the GNUmakefile.  Most
     GNUmakefiles should be unaffected because they rarely rely on the
     order in which instances are built.  If your GNUmakefile does
     depend on the order, you have a few options.  The preferred option
     is to identify the code or steps that need to be executed before
     some of the instances are built and put them into a before-all::
     rule, which is guaranteed to be executed before anything else.  In
     this way your serialized code is executed first, and the build can
     continue in a completely parallel fashion afterwards.

     Another option is to move your instances into separate
     subdirectories, and use serial-subdirectories.make to build them.
     serial-subdirectories.make will respect the order and always build
     them in the order you require.

     If you want to disable parallel building altogether, you can add
     GNUSTEP_MAKE_PARALLEL_BUILDING=no just after including common.make
     to prevent a specific GNUmakefile from doing a parallel build.

     Please note that this does not affect the relationship between
     instances of different types; if you include library.make before
     tool.make, for example, the library (or libraries) will still be
     built before the tool (or tools).  It is the order in which the
     libraries (or tools) are built that is no longer guaranteed.

'support for having source files in subdirectories'
     Starting with version 2.4.0, it is possible to put source files in
     subdirectories by specifiying them as in xxx_OBJC_FILES =
     Source/Beauty.m.  This syntax does not work on versions before
     2.4.0 so you should not use it if you want to support older
     versions of gnustep-make; previously you had to create a subproject
     and add a GNUmakefile in the subdirectory using subproject.make.
     You can now spread your source files in multiple subdirectories
     without using subprojects.

'support for having header files in subdirectories'
     Starting with version 2.4.0, it is possible to put header files in
     subdirectories by specifiying them as in xxx_HEADER_FILES =
     Beauty/Beauty.h.  This syntax does not work on versions before
     2.4.0 so you should not use it if you want to support older
     versions of gnustep-make.  When headers are put in subdirectories
     specified in this way, corresponding subdirectories are created
     when the header files are installed.  For example Beauty/Beauty.h
     would be automatically installed into
     GNUSTEP_HEADERS/HEADER_FILES_INSTALL_DIR/Beauty/Beauty.h.  To get
     the same result in versions before 2.4.0 you would have had to
     manually create the header installation subdirectories.

'support for HEADER_FILES_DIR in framework subproject'
     Before version 2.4.0, specifying xxx_HEADER_FILES_DIR in a
     framework subproject would have no effect.  Starting with version
     2.4.0, the variable is now recognized and can be used to have the
     files in a subdirectory.  You should avoid using the variable in
     framework subprojects if you want to support older versions of
     gnustep-make.

'info files renamed adding a gnustep- prefix'
     To prevent conflicts with other documentation, all the gnustep-make
     info files have been renamed adding a gnustep- prefix.  For
     example, to access the GNUstep faq using info, you now need to type
     'info gnustep-faq' instead of 'info faq'.  Please note that this
     info documentation is in the core/make/Documentation subdirectory
     and at the moment is not automatically installed unless you
     explicitly go in that subdirectory and install it.

'better cleaning for texinfo documentation'
     When you build html documentation from texinfo files, the local
     directory containing the html files was not being removed when
     doing a 'make clean'.  Starting with version 2.4.0, 'make clean'
     removes the directory too.

'debug=no made the default'
     gnustep-make now builds using debug=no by default.  As a
     consequence, on most platforms C/Objective-C/C++ code is now built
     by default using -g -O2 instead of just -g.  If you do not want the
     -O2 flag, you can simply build using 'make debug=yes'.  You can
     also use the new ./configure -enable-debug-by-default option to
     make 'debug=yes' the default flag that is always used when
     compiling if nothing else is specified.  If you do not want the
     debugging symbols, remember that you can use the 'make strip=yes'
     option to have them stripped out from all object files when they
     are installed.

'batch-compilation of Java files'
     gnustep-make used to compile Java files one by one.  In most Java
     compilers this is very suboptimal.  Starting from release 2.4.0,
     gnustep-make will compile all Java files in a Java project with a
     single Java compiler invocation.  This can significantly speed up
     compilation of large projects.  To disable it and get the behaviour
     of gnustep-make 2.2.0, please set the variable
     BATCH_COMPILE_JAVA_FILES to 'no' (or the variable
     xxx_BATCH_COMPILE_JAVA_FILES to 'no' to disable it for a single
     instance).  Please note that if you are using the xxx_FILE_FLAGS or
     xxx_FILE_FILTER_OUT_FLAGS functionality for Java files, which
     allows you to customize the compilation flags for each Java file,
     then batch compilation is automatically disabled and all files are
     compiled separately.

'library resources always installed in directory without 'lib''
     This change only applies to libraries where LIBRARY_NAME starts
     with 'lib' and that install resources.  Due to a bug, versions of
     gnustep-make before 2.4.0 would in this case install the resources
     into the wrong directory, without removing 'lib' from the library
     name.  For example, if LIBRARY_NAME is libgnustep-base, the
     resources would have been installed into
     GNUSTEP_LIBRARY/Libraries/libgnustep-base/Versions/1.14/Resources/
     instead of the correct
     GNUSTEP_LIBRARY/Libraries/gnustep-base/Versions/1.14/Resources/.
     In gnustep-make 2.4.0, this bug has been fixed and the library
     name, without 'lib', will always be used in the resource
     installation directory, no matter if LIBRARY_NAME includes 'lib' or
     not.

     If you have a makefile which is affected and you need to support
     older versions of gnustep-make, you could remove 'lib' from the
     LIBRARY_NAME. That should install resources in the same directory
     on all gnustep-make versions that support library resources (ie,
     gnustep-make >= 2.0.x).

1.13 Version 2.2.0
==================

'libobjc library'
     You can now specify a particular libobjc library to use with the
     -with-objc-lib-flag in configure.  Make now also automatically uses
     -lobjc_gc when using garbage collection.

'parallel building'
     Parallel building is supported now.  You can build using the normal
     make mechanism, e.g.  'make -j 2'.

'install -p'
     gnustep-make now uses 'install -p' by default when installing
     headers and other files.  This preserves the file timestamps and
     can in some cases reduce spurious rebuilds triggered by
     reinstalling headers that have not been modified.  You can use the
     gnustep-make configure option -disable-install-p to disable this
     behaviour and go back to always using a standard 'install'.

'uninstallation of resources'
     gnustep-make now is more careful and accurate when uninstalling
     resources, which means that 'make uninstall' will do a better job
     at removing directories that were created during by 'make install'.

1.14 Version 2.0.7
==================

'default installation'
     New configuration file that allows hardcore developers building
     everything from source to specify arbitrary default installation
     domains for the software.  You just need to copy the
     installation-domains.conf file to the same directory as the
     GNUstep.conf file, and edit it to customize the default
     installation domain (Thanks to Richard for the idea).

'--no-print-directory'
     gnustep-make now uses the -no-print-directory flag when invoking
     make recursively, so the output has changed - starting from 2.0.7
     it should be shorter and more readable.

'change to intermediate object file names'
     gnustep-make now supports having in the same project source files
     with the same name, but a different extension - for example file.c
     and file.m.  The names of intermediate object files have been
     internally changed (for example, from file.o to file.c.o) to
     support this.

'change in path checking algorithm in GNUstep.sh and GNUstep.csh'
     GNUstep.sh and GNUstep.csh perform more careful checks for
     duplicate paths when adding paths to PATH and other path variables.
     Now they check each path separately before adding it, which in some
     cases will produce smaller and less intrusive additions to PATH; in
     particular, on FHS filesystem layout, they will never add /usr/bin
     or other system paths if they are already there.  If you are in a
     situation where there is an overlap between GNUstep paths and
     system paths and you are using GNUstep.sh or GNUstep.csh, you may
     want to check the new values of PATH, CLASSPATH, GUILE_LOAD_PATH,
     INFOPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH and similar variables since they may be
     different from the old ones.

'test applications linked against gnustep-gui by default'
     Test applications (that is, applications created using
     test-application.make) are now linked against gnustep-gui by
     default.

1.15 Version 2.0.6
==================

'GNUSTEP_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_PATHS'
     Added the -enable-absolute-install-paths option to configure on
     Darwin.  Enabling this option modifies the process for building
     dynamic libraries so the install_name stored within a library is an
     absolute path.  Dynamic libraries with an absolute install_name can
     be placed in non-standard locations, but may not be moved from
     their designated location.

'default location of GNUstep.conf on BSD systems'
     This has been changed to /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf to be consistent
     across all Unix systems (except for Apple Mac OS X where it is
     installed in /Library/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf).  To install in a
     different location, use the -with-config-file=PATH option, as in
     -with-config-file=/usr/pkg/etc/GNUstep.conf.

'make.info renamed to gnustep-make.info'
     To prevent conflicts with the standard GNU 'make' info
     documentation, the gnustep-make one has been renamed.  Now you can
     access it as in 'info gnustep-make' instead of 'info make',
     avoiding any conflicts and confusion.  Please note that this info
     documentation is in the core/make/Documentation subdirectory and at
     the moment is not automatically installed unless you explicitly go
     in that subdirectory and install it.

1.16 Version 2.0.5
==================

'default filesystem layout on apple-apple-apple'
     The default filesystem layout when using the apple-apple-apple
     library-combo has been changed from 'gnustep' to the new 'apple'
     filesystem layout, and on darwin the configuration file is by
     default installed in /Library/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf instead of
     /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf.  Using the 'gnustep' filesystem layout
     with the apple-apple-apple library-combo did not make much sense;
     in gnustep-make version 2.0.5 and newer, a ./configure on Apple Mac
     OS X automatically chooses the right library-combo and filesystem
     layout to compile and install Apple native frameworks and
     applications.

'~/GNUstep/GNUstep.sh'
     This script used to be automatically sourced whenever the main
     GNUstep.sh file was sourced.  In gnustep-make version 2 (starting
     with 2.0.5) the file is no longer sourced.  If you are sourcing
     GNUstep.sh at start-up and have a custom shell script that you'd
     like to source in addition to GNUstep.sh, please source it in your
     shell init script before or after sourcing GNUstep.sh.  The same
     applies to ~/GNUstep/GNUstep.csh.

'xxx_NEEDS_GUI'
     This new variable can be used to specify that a project needs to be
     linked against the gui library (or not).  If set to yes, the gui
     library will be linked; if set to no, the gui library will not be
     linked.  If unspecified, the generic variable NEEDS_GUI is used; if
     that is also unspecified, the behaviour depends on the project type
     (and is backwards-compatible): applications, bundles, frameworks,
     palettes and libraries link automatically against the gui library;
     other project types do not.  It is recommended that you set
     xxx_NEEDS_GUI for all bundles, frameworks and libraries to clarify
     how the linking should be done.

'NEEDS_GUI'
     This new variable can be used to specify that all projects built by
     this GNUmakefile need to be linked against the gui library (or
     not).  If set to yes, the gui library will be linked; if set to no,
     the gui library will not be linked.  This behaviour can be
     overridden for specific project targets by using the xxx_NEEDS_GUI
     variable (see above).

1.17 Version 2.0.0
==================

Version 2.0.0 is a new major release of gnustep-make which includes a
number of major changes compared to previous 1.x releases.  Most of the
changes are backwards compatible in the sense that old GNUmakefiles will
work with gnustep-make version 1 or 2 when used in the same conditions
(traditional GNUstep filesystem layout).  But GNUmakefiles might need
updating to work with the new filesystem layout configurations that are
allowed by gnustep-make version 2.

'GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR'
     This variable is deprecated in gnustep-make version 2; you should
     never use it.  gnustep-make version 2 supports installation domains
     that are mapped to filesystem locations in arbitrary ways; for this
     reason, specifying a GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR no longer makes
     sense.  If you need to relocate the whole installation (for
     example, installing into /tmp to prepare a binary package) you
     should use DESTDIR, as in 'make install DESTDIR=/tmp'.  To choose
     an installation domain, you should use GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN,
     as in 'make install GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=LOCAL'. It's
     particularly important that you remove any reference to
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR inside your own GNUmakefiles.

     If your GNUmakefiles contains references to
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR (or similar), you should remove them by
     replacing them with references to the actual logical directory into
     which you want to install.  For example, if your GNUmakefile is
     trying to install something into
     GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR/Library/Libraries, you need to replace it
     with GNUSTEP_LIBRARIES. This is important for non-GNUstep
     filesystem layouts (where, eg, GNUSTEP_LIBRARIES should be set to
     /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib or
     /home/nicola/GNUstep/Library/Libraries depending on the
     installation domain); in that case, gnustep-make will manage
     GNUSTEP_LIBRARIES for you.  Please check the file 'filesystem' for
     more information on the available variables.

'GNUSTEP_xxx_ROOT'
     The variables GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT, GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT,
     GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT, GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT and GNUSTEP_ROOT are
     deprecated in gnustep-make version 2 and you should never use them.
     gnustep-make version 2 supports installation domains that are
     mapped to filesystem locations in arbitrary ways; for this reason,
     a variable like GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT has no longer any use.

     If your GNUmakefiles contains references to GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT (or
     similar), you should remove them by replacing them with references
     to the actual logical directory into which you want to install.
     For example, if your GNUmakefile is trying to install something
     into GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Libraries, you need to replace it
     with GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES. Please check the file 'filesystem'
     for more information on the available variables.

'gnustep-make ./configure and install options'
     The options to configure (and make install), particularly the ones
     to determine the filesystem layout, have been radically changed in
     gnustep-make version 2.  If you have a building or packaging script
     for gnustep-make, you need to make sure you replace your old
     ./configure options with the new ones.  In particular, the
     -with-system-root, -with-local-root and -with-network-root
     configure options have been replaced by the more powerful
     -with-layout configure option.  Also, configure no longer imports
     an existing configuration file so you need to make sure that you
     pass all the options every time.  'make install special_prefix=xxx'
     has been replaced by 'make install DESTDIR=xxx'.

'make debug=yes is now the default'
     The default used to be 'make debug=no'; this has now been changed
     to be 'make debug=yes'.  To get the traditional behaviour, please
     use 'make debug=no'.

'RPM support rewritten'
     The RPM support has been rewritten so if you're using gnustep-make
     to automatically generate RPM packages for your software, you may
     want to review the process.  In particular, there is no longer a
     distinction between debug and non-debug packages.

'xxx_PREPROCESS_INFO_PLIST'
     This variable is now obsolete and can be removed; gnustep-make
     version 2 can automatically detect plists that need preprocessing.

'Framework default version'
     The default framework resource version changed from 'A' to
     INTERFACE_VERSION (which is set, by default, to '0').

'Microsoft Windows updates'
     If you are using Microsoft Windows, you probably want to check the
     new installation instructions and reinstall everything.

'Java tools location changed'
     Java tools are now installed into GNUSTEP_JAVA rather than in a
     subdirectory of GNUSTEP_TOOLS.

'resource-set.make install directory'
     The variable xxx_RESOURCE_FILES_INSTALL_DIR for resource-set.make
     has been deprecated in favour of xxx_INSTALL_DIR. For backwards
     compatibility, you may want to set them both:

     xxx_INSTALL_DIR = $(GNUSTEP_LIBRARY)/Libraries/Resources/xxx

     xxx_RESOURCE_FILES_INSTALL_DIR = /Library/Libraries/Resources/xxx

'INSTALL_ROOT_DIR'
     All instances of INSTALL_ROOT_DIR in user's makefiles should be
     replaced with DESTDIR.

'GNUSTEP_FLATTENED'
     All checks for GNUSTEP_FLATTENED should be updated to check the new
     variable GNUSTEP_IS_FLATTENED instead, and to compare it explicitly
     to 'yes' and 'no', and assume that " means 'yes'.

'./shared_obj'
     The ./shared_obj, ./shared_debug_obj directories and similar are no
     longer created.  You can use ./obj instead.

'library names'
     All libraries now have the same name.

'application names'
     All applications now have the same name.
