 *** What is the FilesystemLayouts directory ***

This directory contains filesystem layouts that you can use when you
configure your gnustep-make.

A filesystem layout describes how the GNUstep installation domains
(System, Network, Local, User) map to directories on disk.

Every file in this directory is a filesystem layout that you can use
in gnustep-make's ./configure (technical note: the files are shell
files that are directly included by ./configure and that should set the
specified variables).  For example:

./configure --with-layout=fhs

./configure --with-layout=fhs-system

By default, the 'fhs' layout is used except on Apple when building
using the apple-apple-apple combo.

If you want to use your own custom layout, just start with one of the
existing layouts, copy it into a new file, and edit it. :-)



 *** Popular Fileystem Layouts ***

Here is a list of popular filesystem layout --

 * gnustep: traditional GNUstep filesystem layout; it installs
everything into /usr/GNUstep/System, /usr/GNUstep/Local.  It's a very
friendly layout, similar to the ones found on NeXTstep, OpenStep and
Apple Mac OS X.  It's a layout that can work nicely with fat binaries,
but may not blend very well with the native environment because
everything is installed in special, GNUstep-only, directories, so you
may need to source a special script (GNUstep.sh) before being able to
use the layout.  Recommended for the advanced GNUstep users and the
NeXTstep/Apple fans.

 * fhs: standard FHS Unix layout for locally compiled software; it
installs everything into /usr/local.  This is the default layout.
Blends very well with native GNU/Linux systems (and other Unix systems
with similar directory structure).  Recommended if you're compiling
from sources on Unix and want good integration with your native
system.

 * fhs-system: standard FHS layout for software to be shipped as part
of distributions/systems; it installs system stuff into /usr, and is
ready to support local stuff to be installed into /usr/local.  Blends
wonderfully with native GNU/Linux systems (and other Unix systems with
similar directory structure) as you're installing everything straight
into the standard system locations.  Recommended if you're building
packages for a Unix system.

 * apple: the Apple Mac OS X layout for software using the
apple-apple-apple library-combo (ie, the Apple frameworks); it
installs everything in /Library or /usr/local.  Blends very well with
native Apple Mac OS X systems.  Recommended if you're compiling your
own software from sources on Apple Mac OS X using the Apple frameworks
(*not* gnustep-base and gnustep-gui) and want good integration with
your native system.
