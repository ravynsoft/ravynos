# localize
# Use different signals to automatically determine country, language, and timezone
# and set up the system accordingly without user intervention.
# Progress from strong (explicit) to weak (implicit) signals.

# Chapter 22. Localization - i18n/L10n Usage and Setup:
# https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/using-localization.html

# TODO: Ideally we would run this whenever a signal is triggered, e.g.,
# * A new USB keyboard with a known VID has been attached
# * The IP address has changed
# But no way is known to set $LANG in an already-running graphical session
