.SH "NAME"
\fBsudo_logsrv.proto\fR
\- Sudo log server protocol
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Starting with version 1.9.0,
\fBsudo\fR
supports sending event and I/O logs to a log server.
The protocol used is written in Google's Protocol Buffers domain
specific language.
The
\fIEXAMPLES\fR
section includes a complete description of the protocol in Protocol
Buffers format.
.PP
Because there is no way to determine message boundaries when using
Protocol Buffers, the wire size of each message is sent immediately
preceding the message itself as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network
byte order.
This is referred to as
\(lqlength-prefix framing\(rq
and is how Google suggests handling the lack of message delimiters.
.PP
The protocol is made up of two basic messages,
\fIClientMessage\fR
and
\fIServerMessage\fR,
described below.
The server must accept messages up to two megabytes in size.
The server may return an error if the client tries to send a message
larger than two megabytes.
.SH "Client Messages"
A
\fIClientMessage\fR
is a container used to encapsulate all the possible message types
a client may send to the server.
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
message ClientMessage {
  oneof type {
    AcceptMessage accept_msg = 1;
    RejectMessage reject_msg = 2;
    ExitMessage exit_msg = 3;
    RestartMessage restart_msg = 4;
    AlertMessage alert_msg = 5;
    IoBuffer ttyin_buf = 6;
    IoBuffer ttyout_buf = 7;
    IoBuffer stdin_buf = 8;
    IoBuffer stdout_buf = 9;
    IoBuffer stderr_buf = 10;
    ChangeWindowSize winsize_event = 11;
    CommandSuspend suspend_event = 12;
    ClientHello hello_msg = 13;
  }
}
.RE
.fi
.PP
The different
\fIClientMessage\fR
sub-messages the client may sent to the server are described below.
.SS "TimeSpec"
.nf
.RS 0n
message TimeSpec {
    int64 tv_sec = 1;
    int32 tv_nsec = 2;
}
.RE
.fi
.PP
A
\fITimeSpec\fR
is the equivalent of a POSIX
\fIstruct timespec\fR,
containing seconds and nanoseconds members.
The
\fItv_sec\fR
member is a 64-bit integer to support dates after the year 2038.
.SS "InfoMessage"
.nf
.RS 0n
message InfoMessage {
  message StringList {
    repeated string strings = 1;
  }
  message NumberList {
    repeated int64 numbers = 1;

  }
}
.RE
.fi
.PP
An
\fIInfoMessage\fR
is used to represent information about the invoking user as well as the
execution environment the command runs in the form of key-value pairs.
The key is always a string but the value may be a 64-bit integer,
a string, an array of strings, or an array of 64-bit integers.
The event log data is composed of
\fIInfoMessage\fR
entries.
See the
\fIEVENT LOG VARIABLES\fR
section for more information.
.SS "ClientHello hello_msg"
.nf
.RS 0n
message ClientHello {
  string client_id = 1;
}

.fi
.PP
A
\fIClientHello\fR
message consists of client information that may be sent to the
server when the client first connects.
.TP 8n
client_id
A free-form client description.
This usually includes the name and version of the client implementation.
.SS "AcceptMessage accept_msg"
.nf
.RS 0n
message AcceptMessage {

The wall clock time when the command was submitted to the security policy.
.TP 8n
info_msgs
An array of
\fIInfoMessage\fR
describing the user who submitted the command as well as the execution
environment of the command.
This information is used to generate an event log entry and may also be
used by server to determine where and how the I/O log is stored.
.TP 8n
expect_iobufs
Set to true if the server should expect
\fIIoBuffer\fR
messages to follow (for I/O logging) or false if the server should only
store the event log.
.PP
If an
\fIAcceptMessage\fR
is sent, the client must not send a
\fIRejectMessage\fR
or
\fIRestartMessage\fR.
.SS "RejectMessage reject_msg"
.nf
.RS 0n
message RejectMessage {
  TimeSpec submit_time = 1;

  bool dumped_core = 3;
  string signal = 4;
  string error = 5;
}
.PP
.RE
.fi
An
\fIExitMessage\fR
is sent by the client after the command has exited or has been
terminated by a signal.
It contains the following members:
.TP 8n
run_time
The total amount of elapsed time since the command started,
calculated using a monotonic clock where possible.
This is not the wall clock time.
.TP 8n
exit_value
The command's exit value in the range 0-255.
.TP 8n
dumped_core
True if the command was terminated by a signal and dumped core.
.TP 8n
signal
If the command was terminated by a signal, this is set to the
name of the signal without the leading
\(lqSIG\(rq.
For example,
\fRINT\fR,
\fRTERM\fR,
\fRKILL\fR,
\fRSEGV\fR.
.TP 8n
error
A message from the client indicating that the command was terminated
unexpectedly due to an error.
.PP
When performing I/O logging, the client should wait for a
\fIcommit_point\fR
corresponding to the final
\fIIoBuffer\fR
before closing the connection unless the final
\fIcommit_point\fR
has already been received.
.SS "RestartMessage restart_msg"
.nf
.RS 0n
message RestartMessage {
  string log_id = 1;
  TimeSpec resume_point = 2;
}
.RE
.fi
.PP
A
\fIRestartMessage\fR
is sent by the client to resume sending an existing I/O log that
was previously interrupted.
It contains the following members:
.TP 8n
log_id
The the server-side name for an I/O log that was previously
sent to the client by the server.
This may be a path name on the server or some other kind of server-side
identifier.
.TP 8n
resume_point
The point in time after which to resume the I/O log.
This is in the form of a
\fITimeSpec\fR
representing the amount of time since the command started, not
the wall clock time.
The
\fIresume_point\fR
should correspond to a
\fIcommit_point\fR
previously sent to the client by the server.
If the server receives a
\fIRestartMessage\fR
containing a
\fIresume_point\fR
it has not previously seen, an error will be returned to the client
and the connection will be dropped.
.PP
If a
\fIRestartMessage\fR
is sent, the client must not send an
\fIAcceptMessage\fR
or
\fIRejectMessage\fR.

.SH "Server Messages"
A
\fIServerMessage\fR
is a container used to encapsulate all the possible message types
the server may send to a client.
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
message ServerMessage {
  oneof type {
    ServerHello hello = 1;
    TimeSpec commit_point = 2;
    string log_id = 3;
    string error = 4;
    string abort = 5;
  }
}
.RE
.fi
.PP
The different
\fIServerMessage\fR
sub-messages the server may sent to the client are described below.
.SS "ServerHello hello"
.nf
.RS 0n
message ServerHello {
  string server_id = 1;
  string redirect = 2;
  repeated string servers = 3;
  bool subcommands = 4;
}
.RE
.fi
.PP
The
\fIServerHello\fR
message consists of server information sent when the client first connects.
It contains the following members:
.TP 8n
server_id
A free-form server description.
Usually this includes the name and version of the implementation
running on the log server.
This member is always present.
.TP 8n
redirect
A host and port separated by a colon
(\(oq\(cq):
that the client should connect to instead.
The host may be a host name, an IPv4 address, or an IPv6 address
in square brackets.
This may be used for server load balancing.
The server will disconnect after sending the
\fIServerHello\fR
when it includes a
\fBredirect\fR.
.TP 8n
servers
.br
A list of other known log servers.
This can be used to implement log server redundancy and allows the
client to discover all other log servers simply by connecting to
one known server.
This member may be omitted when there is only a single log server.
.TP 8n
subcommands
If set, the server supports logging additional commands during a session.
The client may send an
\fIAcceptMessage\fR
or
\fIRejectMessage\fR
when
\fBsudo\fR
is running in
\fIintercept\fR
mode.
In this mode, commands spawned from the initial command authorized by
\fBsudo\fR
are subject to policy restrictions and/or are logged.
If
\fIsubcommands\fR
is false, the client must not attempt to log additional commands.
.SS "TimeSpec commit_point"
A periodic time stamp sent by the server to indicate when I/O log
buffers have been committed to storage.
This message is not sent after every
\fIIoBuffer\fR
but rather at a server-configurable interval.
When the server receives an
\fIExitMessage\fR,
it will respond with a
\fIcommit_point\fR
corresponding to the last received
\fIIoBuffer\fR
before closing the connection.
.SS "string log_id"
The server-side ID of the I/O log being stored, sent in response
to an
\fIAcceptMessage\fR
where
\fIexpect_iobufs\fR
is true.
.SS "string error"
A fatal server-side error.
The server will close the connection after sending the
\fIerror\fR
message.
.SS "string abort"
An
\fIabort\fR
message from the server indicates that the client should kill the
command and terminate the session.
It may be used to implement simple server-side policy.
The server will close the connection after sending the
\fIabort\fR
message.
.SH "Protocol flow of control"
The expected protocol flow is as follows:
.TP 5n
1.\&
Client connects to the first available server.
If the client is configured to use TLS, a TLS handshake will be
attempted.
.TP 5n
2.\&
Client sends
\fIClientHello\fR.
This is currently optional but allows the server to detect a
non-TLS connection on the TLS port.
.TP 5n
3.\&
Server sends
\fIServerHello\fR.
.TP 5n
4.\&
Client responds with either
\fIAcceptMessage\fR,
\fIRejectMessage\fR,
or
\fIRestartMessage\fR.
.TP 5n
5.\&
If client sent a
\fIAcceptMessage\fR
with
\fIexpect_iobufs\fR
set, server creates a new I/O log and responds with a
\fIlog_id\fR.
.TP 5n
6.\&
Client sends zero or more
\fIIoBuffer\fR
messages.
.TP 5n
7.\&
Server periodically responds to
\fIIoBuffer\fR
messages with a
\fIcommit_point\fR.
.TP 5n
8.\&
Client sends an
\fIExitMessage\fR
when the command exits or is killed.
.TP 5n
9.\&
Server sends the final
\fIcommit_point\fR
if one is pending.
.TP 5n
10.\&
Server closes the connection.
After receiving the final
\fIcommit_point\fR,
the client shuts down its side of the TLS connection if TLS
is in use, and closes the connection.
.TP 5n
11.\&
Server shuts down its side of the TLS connection if TLS is in use,
and closes the connection.
.PP
At any point, the server may send an
\fIerror\fR
or
\fIabort\fR
message to the client at which point the server will close the
connection.
If an
\fIabort\fR
message is received, the client should terminate the running command.
.SH "EVENT LOG VARIABLES"
\fIAcceptMessage\fR,
\fIAlertMessage\fR
and
\fIRejectMessage\fR
classes contain an array of
\fIInfoMessage\fR
that should contain information about the user who submitted the command
as well as information about the execution environment of the command
if it was accepted.
.PP
Some variables have a
\fIclient\fR,
\fIrun\fR,
or
\fIsubmit\fR
prefix.
These prefixes are used to eliminate ambiguity for variables that
could apply to the client program, the user submitting the command,
or the command being run.
Variables with a
\fIclient\fR
prefix pertain to the program performing the connection to the log
server, for example
\fBsudo\fR.
Variables with a
\fIrun\fR
prefix pertain to the command that the user requested be run.
Variables with a
\fIsubmit\fR
prefix pertain to the user submitting the request
(the user running \fBsudo\fR).
.PP
