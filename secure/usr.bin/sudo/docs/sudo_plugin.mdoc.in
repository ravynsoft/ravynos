.Sh NAME
.Nm sudo_plugin
.Nd Sudo Plugin API
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Starting with version 1.8,
.Nm sudo
supports a plugin API
for policy and session logging.
Plugins may be compiled as dynamic shared objects (the default on
systems that support them) or compiled statically into the
.Nm sudo
binary itself.
By default, the
.Nm sudoers
plugin provides audit, security policy and I/O logging capabilities.
Via the plugin API,
.Nm sudo
can be configured to use alternate plugins provided by third parties.
The plugins to be used are specified in the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
file.
.Pp
The API is versioned with a major and minor number.
The minor version number is incremented when additions are made.
The major number is incremented when incompatible changes are made.
A plugin should be check the version passed to it and make sure that the
major version matches.
.Pp
The plugin API is defined by the
.In sudo_plugin.h
header file.
.Ss Policy plugin API
A policy plugin must declare and populate a
.Vt struct policy_plugin
in the global scope.
This structure contains pointers to the functions that implement the
.Nm sudo
policy checks.
The name of the symbol should be specified in
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
along with a path to the plugin so that
.Nm sudo
can load it.
.Bd -literal
struct policy_plugin {
#define SUDO_POLICY_PLUGIN     1
    unsigned int type; /* always SUDO_POLICY_PLUGIN */
    unsigned int version; /* always SUDO_API_VERSION */
    int (*open)(unsigned int version, sudo_conv_t conversation,
        sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf, char * const settings[],
        char * const user_info[], char * const user_env[],

    struct sudo_plugin_event * (*event_alloc)(void);
};
.Ed
.Pp
A
.Vt struct policy_plugin
has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa type
The
.Fa type
field should always be set to SUDO_POLICY_PLUGIN.
.It Fa version
The
.Fa version
field should be set to
.Dv SUDO_API_VERSION .
.Pp
This allows
.Nm sudo
to determine the API version the plugin was
built against.
.It Fa open
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*open)(unsigned int version, sudo_conv_t conversation,
    sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf, char * const settings[],
    char * const user_info[], char * const user_env[],
    char * const plugin_options[], const char **errstr);
.Ed
.Pp
Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
.Nm sudo
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
.Fn conversation
or
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function with
.Dv SUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG
to present additional error information to the user.
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa version
The version passed in by
.Nm sudo
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
.Nm sudo .
.It Fa conversation
A pointer to the
.Fn conversation
function that can be used by the plugin to interact with the user (see
.Sx Conversation API
for details).
Returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa sudo_plugin_printf
A pointer to a
.Fn printf Ns -style
function that may be used to display informational or error messages (see
.Sx Conversation API
for details).
Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa settings
A vector of user-supplied
.Nm sudo
settings in the form of
.Dq name=value
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
.Nm sudo .
As such, they will only be present when the corresponding option has
been specified on the command line.
.Pp
When parsing
.Fa settings ,
the plugin should split on the
.Sy first
equal sign
.Pq Ql =
since the
.Em name
field will never include one itself but the
.Em value
might.
.Pp
The following values may be set by
.Nm sudo :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It bsdauth_type=string
Authentication type, if specified by the
.Fl a
option, to use on
systems where
.Bx
authentication is supported.
.It closefrom=number
If specified, the user has requested via the
.Fl C
option that
.Nm sudo
close all files descriptors with a value of
.Em number
or higher.
The plugin may optionally pass this, or another value, back in the
.Fa command_info
list.
.It cmnd_chroot=string
The root directory (see
.Xr chroot 2 )
to run the command in, as specified by the user via the
.Fl R
option.
The plugin may ignore or restrict the user's ability to specify a new
root directory.
Only available starting with API version 1.16.
.It cmnd_cwd=string
The working directory to run the command in, as specified by the user via the
.Fl D
option.
The plugin may ignore or restrict the user's ability to specify a new
working directory.
Only available starting with API version 1.16.
.It debug_flags=string
A debug file path name followed by a space and a comma-separated
list of debug flags that correspond to the plugin's
.Em Debug
entry in
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ ,
if there is one.
The flags are passed to the plugin exactly as they appear in
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ .
The syntax used by
.Nm sudo
and the
.Nm sudoers
plugin is
.Em subsystem Ns @ Ns Em priority
but a plugin is free to use a different
format so long as it does not include a comma
.Pq Ql ,\& .
Prior to
.Nm sudo
1.8.12, there was no way to specify plugin-specific
.Em debug_flags
so the value was always the same as that used by the
.Nm sudo
front-end and did not include a path name, only the flags themselves.
As of version 1.7 of the plugin interface,
.Nm sudo
will only pass
.Em debug_flags
if
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@
contains a plugin-specific
.Em Debug
entry.
.It ignore_ticket=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl k
option along with a
command, indicating that the user wishes to ignore any cached
authentication credentials.
.Em implied_shell
to true.
This allows
.Nm sudo
with no arguments
to be used similarly to
.Xr su 1 .
If the plugin does not to support this usage, it may return a value of \-2
from the
.Fn check_policy
function, which will cause
.Nm sudo
to print a usage message and exit.
.It implied_shell=bool
If the user does not specify a program on the command line,
.Nm sudo
will pass the plugin the path to the user's shell and set
.Em implied_shell .
.It intercept_ptrace=bool
Indicates whether or not the system supports intercept
mode using
.Xr ptrace 2 .
This is currently only true for Linux systems that support
.Xr seccomp 2
filtering and the
.Dq trap
action.
Other systems will use a dynamic shared object to implement
intercept.
Only available starting with API version 1.19.
.It intercept_setid=bool
Indicates whether or not the system supports running set-user-ID
and set-group-ID binaries in intercept mode.
This is currently only true for Linux systems that support
.Xr seccomp 2
filtering and the
.Dq trap
action.
On systems that use a dynamic shared object to implement
intercept, the dynamic linker (ld.so or the equivalent)
will disable preloading of shared objects when executing a
set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary.
This will disable intercept mode for that program and any other
programs that it executes.
The policy plugin may refuse to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID
binary in intercept mode to avoid this.
Only available starting with API version 1.19.
.It login_class=string
.Bx
login class to use when setting resource limits and nice value,
if specified by the
.Fl c
option.
.It login_shell=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl i
option, indicating that
the user wishes to run a login shell.
.It max_groups=int
The maximum number of groups a user may belong to.
This will only be present if there is a corresponding setting in
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ .
.It network_addrs=list
A space-separated list of IP network addresses and netmasks in the
form
.Dq addr/netmask ,
e.g.,
.Dq 192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0 .
The address and netmask pairs may be either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on
what the operating system supports.
If the address contains a colon
.Pq Ql :\& ,
it is an IPv6 address, else it is IPv4.
.It noninteractive=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl n
option, indicating that
.Nm sudo
should operate in non-interactive mode.
The plugin may reject a command run in non-interactive mode if user
interaction is required.
.It plugin_dir=string
The default plugin directory used by the
.Nm sudo
front-end.
This is the default directory set at compile time and may not
correspond to the directory the running plugin was loaded from.
It may be used by a plugin to locate support files.
.It plugin_path=string
The path name of plugin loaded by the
.Nm sudo
front-end.
The path name will be a fully-qualified unless the plugin was
statically compiled into
.Nm sudo .
.It preserve_environment=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl E
option, indicating that
the user wishes to preserve the environment.
.It preserve_groups=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl P
option, indicating that
the user wishes to preserve the group vector instead of setting it
based on the runas user.
.It progname=string
The command name that sudo was run as, typically
.Dq sudo
or
.Dq sudoedit .
.It prompt=string
The prompt to use when requesting a password, if specified via
the
.Fl p
option.
.It remote_host=string
The name of the remote host to run the command on, if specified via
the
.Fl h
option.
Support for running the command on a remote host is meant to be implemented
via a helper program that is executed in place of the user-specified command.
The
.Nm sudo
front-end is only capable of executing commands on the local host.
Only available starting with API version 1.4.
.It run_shell=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl s
option, indicating that the user wishes to run a shell.
.It runas_group=string
The group name or group-ID to run the command as, if specified via
the
.Fl g
option.
.It runas_user=string
The user name or user-ID to run the command as, if specified via the
.Fl u
option.
.It selinux_role=string
SELinux role to use when executing the command, if specified by
the
.Fl r
option.
.It selinux_type=string
SELinux type to use when executing the command, if specified by
the
.Fl t
option.
.It set_home=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
.Fl H
option.
If true, set the
.Ev HOME
environment variable to the target user's home directory.
.It sudoedit=bool
Set to true when the
.Fl e
option is specified or if invoked as
.Nm sudoedit .
The plugin shall substitute an editor into
.Fa argv
in the
.Fn check_policy
function or return \-2 with a usage error
if the plugin does not support
.Em sudoedit .
For more information, see the
.Fn check_policy
section.
.It timeout=string
Command timeout specified by the user via the
.Fl T
option.
Not all plugins support command timeouts and the ability of the
user to set a timeout may be restricted by policy.
The format of the timeout string is plugin-specific.
.It update_ticket=bool
Set to false if the user specified the
.Fl N
option, indicating that the user wishes to avoid updating any cached
authentication credentials.
Only available starting with API version 1.20.
.El
.Pp
Additional settings may be added in the future so the plugin should
silently ignore settings that it does not recognize.
.It Fa user_info
A vector of information about the user running the command in the form of
.Dq name=value
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.Pp
When parsing
.Fa user_info ,
the plugin should split on the
.Sy first
equal sign
.Pq Ql =
since the
.Em name
field will never include one
itself but the
.Em value
might.
.Pp
The following values may be set by
.Nm sudo :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It cols=int
The number of columns the user's terminal supports.
If there is no terminal device available, a default value of 80 is used.

The name of the user invoking
.Nm sudo .
.El
.It Fa user_env
The user's environment in the form of a
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated vector of
.Dq name=value
strings.
.Pp
When parsing
.Fa user_env ,
the plugin should split on the
.Sy first
equal sign
.Pq Ql =
since the
.Em name
field will never include one
itself but the
.Em value
might.
.It Fa plugin_options
Any (non-comment) strings immediately after the plugin path are
passed as arguments to the plugin.
These arguments are split on a white space boundary and are passed to
the plugin in the form of a
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated
array of strings.
If no arguments were
specified,
.Fa plugin_options
will be the
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.Pp
The
.Fa plugin_options
parameter is only available starting with
API version 1.2.
A plugin
.Sy must
check the API version specified
by the
.Nm sudo
front-end before using
.Fa plugin_options .
Failure to do so may result in a crash.
.It Fa errstr
If the
.Fn open
function returns a value other than 1, the plugin may
store a message describing the failure or error in
.Fa errstr .
The
.Nm sudo
front-end will then pass this value to any registered audit plugins.
The string stored in
.Fa errstr
must remain valid until the plugin's
.Fn close
function is called.
.Pp
The
.Fa errstr
parameter is only available starting with
API version 1.15.
A plugin
.Sy must
check the API version specified by the
.Nm sudo
front-end before using
.Fa errstr .
Failure to do so may result in a crash.
.El
.It Fa close
.Bd -literal -compact
void (*close)(int exit_status, int error);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn close
function is called when
.Nm sudo
is finished, shortly before it exits.
Starting with API version 1.15,
.Fn close
is called regardless of whether or not a command was actually executed.
This makes it possible for plugins to perform cleanup even when a
command was not run.
It is not possible to tell whether a command was run based solely
on the arguments passed to the
.Fn close
function.
To determine if a command was actually run,
the plugin must keep track of whether or not the
.Fn check_policy
function returned successfully.
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa exit_status
The command's exit status, as returned by the
.Xr wait 2
system call, or zero if no command was run.
The value of
.Fa exit_status
is undefined if
.Fa error
is non-zero.
.It Fa error
If the command could not be executed, this is set to the value of
.Va errno
set by the
.Xr execve 2
system call.
The plugin is responsible for displaying error information via the
.Fn conversation
or
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function.
If the command was successfully executed, the value of
.Fa error
is zero.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Fn close
function is defined, no I/O logging plugins are loaded,
and neither the
.Em timeout
nor
.Em use_pty
options are set in the
.Fa command_info
list, the
.Nm sudo
front-end may execute the command directly instead of running
it as a child process.
.It Fa show_version
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*show_version)(int verbose);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn show_version
function is called by
.Nm sudo
when the user specifies the
.Fl V
option.
The plugin may display its version information to the user via the
.Fn conversation
or
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function using
.Dv SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG .
If the user requests detailed version information, the
.Fa verbose
flag will be non-zero.
.Pp
Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error, although the return value is currently
ignored.
.It Fa check_policy
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*check_policy)(int argc, char * const argv[], char *env_add[],
    char **command_info[], char **argv_out[], char **user_env_out[],
    const char **errstr);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn check_policy
function is called by
.Nm sudo
to determine
whether the user is allowed to run the specified commands.
.Pp
If the
.Em sudoedit
option was enabled in the
.Fa settings
array passed to the
.Fn open
function, the user has requested
.Em sudoedit
mode.
.Em sudoedit
is a mechanism for editing one or more files
where an editor is run with the user's credentials instead of with
elevated privileges.
.Nm sudo
achieves this by creating user-writable
temporary copies of the files to be edited and then overwriting the
originals with the temporary copies after editing is complete.
If the plugin supports
.Em sudoedit ,
it must set
.Em sudoedit=true
in the
.Fa command_info
list.
The plugin is responsible for choosing the editor to be used,
potentially from a variable in the user's environment, such as
.Ev EDITOR ,
and should be stored in
.Fa argv_out
(environment variables may include command line options).
The files to be edited should be copied from
.Fa argv
to
.Fa argv_out ,
separated from the
editor and its arguments by a
.Ql --
element.
The
.Ql --
will be removed by
.Nm sudo
before the editor is executed.
The plugin may also set
.Em sudoedit_nfiles
to the number of files to be edited in the
.Fa command_info
list; this will only be used by the
.Nm sudo
front-end starting with API version 1.21.
.Pp
The
.Fn check_policy
function returns 1 if the command is allowed,
0 if not allowed, \-1 for a general error, or \-2 for a usage error
or if
.Em sudoedit
was specified but is unsupported by the plugin.
In the latter case,
.Nm sudo
will print a usage message before it
exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
.Fn conversation
or
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function with
.Dv SUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG
to present additional error information to the user.
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa argc
The number of elements in
.Fa argv ,
not counting the final
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.It Fa argv
The argument vector describing the command the user wishes to run,
in the same form as what would be passed to the
.Xr execve 2
system call.
The vector is terminated by a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
.It Fa env_add
Additional environment variables specified by the user on the command
line in the form of a
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated
vector of
.Dq name=value
strings.
The plugin may reject the command if one or more variables
are not allowed to be set, or it may silently ignore such variables.
.Pp
When parsing
.Fa env_add ,
the plugin should split on the
.Sy first
equal sign
.Pq Ql =
since the
.Em name
field will never include one itself but the
.Em value
might.
.It Fa command_info
Information about the command being run in the form of
.Dq name=value
strings.
These values are used by
.Nm sudo
to set the execution environment when running a command.
The plugin is responsible for creating and populating the vector,
which must be terminated with a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
The following values are recognized by
.Nm sudo :
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It apparmor_profile=string
AppArmor profile to transition to when executing the command.
Only available starting with API version 1.19.
.It chroot=string
The root directory to use when running the command.
.It closefrom=number
If specified,
.Nm sudo
will close all files descriptors with a value
of
.Em number
or higher.
.It command=string
Fully qualified path to the command to be executed.
.It cwd=string
The current working directory to change to when executing the command.
If
.Nm sudo
is unable to change to the new working directory, the command will
not be run unless
.Em cwd_optional
is also set (see below).
.It cwd_optional=bool
If set,
.Nm sudo
will treat an inability to change to the new working directory as a
non-fatal error.
This setting has no effect unless
.Em cwd
is also set.
.It exec_background=bool
By default,
.Nm sudo
runs a command as the foreground process as long as
.Nm sudo
itself is running in the foreground.
When
.Em exec_background
is enabled and the command is being run in a pseudo-terminal
(due to I/O logging or the
.Em use_pty
setting), the command will be run as a background process.
Attempts to read from the controlling terminal (or to change terminal
settings) will result in the command being suspended with the
.Dv SIGTTIN
signal (or
.Dv SIGTTOU
in the case of terminal settings).
If this happens when
.Nm sudo
is a foreground process, the command will be granted the controlling terminal
and resumed in the foreground with no user intervention required.
The advantage of initially running the command in the background is that
.Nm sudo
need not read from the terminal unless the command explicitly requests it.
Otherwise, any terminal input must be passed to the command, whether it
has required it or not (the kernel buffers terminals so it is not possible
to tell whether the command really wants the input).
This is different from historic
.Nm sudo
behavior or when the command is not being run in a pseudo-terminal.
.Pp
For this to work seamlessly, the operating system must support the
automatic restarting of system calls.
Unfortunately, not all operating systems do this by default,
and even those that do may have bugs.
For example, macOS fails to restart the
.Fn tcgetattr
and
.Fn tcsetattr
system calls (this is a bug in macOS).
Furthermore, because this behavior depends on the command stopping with the
.Dv SIGTTIN
or
.Dv SIGTTOU
signals, programs that catch these signals and suspend themselves
with a different signal (usually
.Dv SIGTOP )
will not be automatically foregrounded.
Some versions of the linux
.Xr su 1
command behave this way.
Because of this, a plugin should not set
.Em exec_background
unless it is explicitly enabled by the administrator and there should
be a way to enabled or disable it on a per-command basis.
.Pp
This setting has no effect unless I/O logging is enabled or
.Em use_pty
is enabled.
.It execfd=number
If specified,
.Nm sudo

The
.Fn init_session
function is called before
.Nm sudo
sets up the
execution environment for the command.
It is run in the parent
.Nm sudo
process before any user-ID or group-ID changes.
This can be used to perform session setup that is not supported by
.Fa command_info ,
such as opening the PAM session.
The
.Fn close
function can be
used to tear down the session that was opened by
.Fn init_session .

.Pp
When an I/O plugin is loaded,
.Nm sudo
runs the command in a pseudo-terminal.
This makes it possible to log the input and output from the user's
session.
If any of the standard input, standard output, or standard error do not
correspond to a tty,
.Nm sudo
will open a pipe to capture the I/O for logging before passing it on.
.Pp
The
.Fn log_ttyin
function receives the raw user input from the terminal
device (this will include input even when echo is disabled,
such as when a password is read).
The
.Fn log_ttyout
function receives output from the pseudo-terminal that is
suitable for replaying the user's session at a later time.
The
.Fn log_stdin ,
.Fn log_stdout ,
and
.Fn log_stderr
functions are only called if the standard input, standard output,
or standard error respectively correspond to something other than
a tty.
.Pp
Any of the logging functions may be set to the
.Dv NULL
pointer if no logging is to be performed.
If the open function returns 0, no I/O will be sent to the plugin.
.Pp
If a logging function returns an error
.Pq \-1 ,
the running command will be terminated and all of the plugin's logging
functions will be disabled.
Other I/O logging plugins will still receive any remaining
input or output that has not yet been processed.
.Pp
If an input logging function rejects the data by returning 0, the
command will be terminated and the data will not be passed to the
command, though it will still be sent to any other I/O logging plugins.
If an output logging function rejects the data by returning 0, the
command will be terminated and the data will not be written to the
terminal, though it will still be sent to any other I/O logging plugins.

.Fn log_ttyout ,
.Fn log_stdin ,
.Fn log_stdout ,
.Fn log_stderr ,
.Fn log_suspend ,
.Fn change_winsize ,
or
.Fn show_version
functions are called.
It is only called if the version is being requested or if the
policy plugin's
.Fn check_policy
function has returned successfully.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
.Nm sudo
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
.Fn conversation
or
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function with
.Dv SUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG
to present additional error information to the user.
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa version
The version passed in by
.Nm sudo
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
.Nm sudo .
.It Fa conversation
A pointer to the
.Fn conversation
function that may be used by the
.Fn Fa show_version
function to display version information (see
.Fn show_version
below).
The
.Fn conversation
function may also be used to display additional error message to the user.
The
.Fn conversation
function returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa sudo_plugin_printf
A pointer to a
.Fn printf Ns -style
function that may be used by the
.Fn show_version
function to display version information (see
show_version below).
The
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function may also be used to display additional error message to the user.
The
.Fn sudo_plugin_printf
function returns number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa settings
A vector of user-supplied
.Nm sudo
settings in the form of
.Dq name=value
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
.Nm sudo .
As such, they will only be present when the corresponding option has
been specified on the command line.
.Pp
When parsing
.Fa settings ,
the plugin should split on the

not counting the final
.Dv NULL
pointer.
It can be zero, such as when
.Nm sudo
is called with the
.Fl V
option.
.It Fa argv
If
.No non- Ns Dv NULL ,
an argument vector describing a command the user
wishes to run in the same form as what would be passed to the

When parsing
.Fa user_env ,
the plugin should split on the
.Sy first
equal sign
.Pq Ql =
since the
.Em name
field will never include one
itself but the

.It Fa plugin_options
Any (non-comment) strings immediately after the plugin path are
treated as arguments to the plugin.
These arguments are split on a white space boundary and are passed to
the plugin in the form of a
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated
array of strings.
If no arguments were specified,
.Fa plugin_options
will be the
.Dv NULL

.Fn plugin_printf
function may also be used to display additional error message to the user.
The
.Fn plugin_printf
function returns number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa settings
A vector of user-supplied
.Nm sudo
settings in the form of
.Dq name=value
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
.Dv NULL
pointer.
These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
.Nm sudo .
As such, they will only be present when the corresponding option has
been specified on the command line.
.Pp
When parsing
.Fa settings ,
the plugin should split on the

.Fa submit_argv Ns [ Fa submit_optind ]
will evaluate to the NULL pointer.
.It Fa submit_argv
The argument vector
.Nm sudo

plugin that succeeds and once for the sudo front-end.
When called on behalf of the sudo front-end,
.Fa command_info
may include information from an I/O logging plugin as well.
.Pp
Typically, an audit plugin is interested in either the accept status from
the
.Nm sudo
front-end or from the various policy and approval plugins, but not both.
It is possible for the policy plugin to accept a command that is

.Pp
An approval plugin can be used to apply extra constraints after a
command has been accepted by the policy plugin.
Unlike the other plugin types, it does not remain open until the command
completes.
The plugin is opened before a call to
.Fn check
or
.Fn show_version
and closed shortly thereafter (audit plugin functions must be called
before the plugin is closed).
Multiple approval plugins may be specified in
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ .
.Pp
A
.Vt struct approval_plugin
has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa type
The
.Fa type
field should always be set to
.Dv SUDO_APPROVAL_PLUGIN .
.It Fa version
The
.Fa version
field should be set to
.Dv SUDO_API_VERSION .
.Pp
This allows
.Nm sudo
to determine the API version the plugin was
built against.

.Ed
.Pp
The approval
.Fn open
function is run immediately before a call to the plugin's
.Fn check
or
.Fn show_version
functions.
It is only called if the version is being requested or if the
policy plugin's
.Fn check_policy
function has returned successfully.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
.Nm sudo
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
.Fn conversation
or
.Fn plugin_printf
function with
.Dv SUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG
to present additional error information to the user.
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa version
The version passed in by
.Nm sudo
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
.Nm sudo .
.It Fa conversation
A pointer to the
.Fn conversation
function that can be used by the plugin to interact with the user (see
.Sx Conversation API
for details).
Returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa plugin_printf
A pointer to a
.Fn printf Ns -style
function that may be used to display informational or error messages (see
.Sx Conversation API
for details).
Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa settings
A vector of user-supplied
.Nm sudo
settings in the form of
.Dq name=value

These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
.Nm sudo .

If multiple approval plugins are loaded, they must all succeed for
the command to be allowed.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,

In the latter case,
.Nm sudo
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the

.Fn plugin_printf
function using
.Dv SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG .
If the user requests detailed version information, the verbose flag will be set.

.Ss Signal handlers
The
.Nm sudo
front-end installs default signal handlers to trap common signals
while the plugin functions are run.
The following signals are trapped by default before the command is
executed:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -width 1n
.It
.Dv SIGALRM
.It
.Dv SIGHUP
.It

.It
.Dv SIGTERM
.It
.Dv SIGTSTP
.It
.Dv SIGUSR1
.It
.Dv SIGUSR2
.El
.Pp
If a fatal signal is received before the command is executed,
.Nm sudo
will call the plugin's
.Fn close
function with an exit status of 128 plus the value of the signal
that was received.
This allows for consistent logging of commands killed by a signal
for plugins that log such information in their
.Fn close
function.
An exception to this is
.Dv SIGPIPE ,
which is ignored until the command is executed.
.Pp
A plugin may temporarily install its own signal handlers but must
restore the original handler before the plugin function returns.
.Ss Hook function API
Beginning with plugin API version 1.2, it is possible to install
hooks for certain functions called by the
.Nm sudo
front-end.
.Pp
Currently, the only supported hooks relate to the handling of
environment variables.
Hooks can be used to intercept attempts to get, set, or remove
environment variables so that these changes can be reflected in
the version of the environment that is used to execute a command.
A future version of the API will support hooking internal
.Nm sudo
front-end functions as well.
.Pp
.Em Hook structure
.Pp
Hooks in
.Nm sudo
are described by the following structure:
.Bd -literal
typedef int (*sudo_hook_fn_t)();

struct sudo_hook {
    unsigned int hook_version;
    unsigned int hook_type;
    sudo_hook_fn_t hook_fn;
    void *closure;
};
.Ed
.Pp
A
.Vt struct sudo_hook
has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa hook_version
The
.Fa hook_version
field should be set to
.Dv SUDO_HOOK_VERSION .
.It Fa hook_type
The
.Fa hook_type
field may be one of the following supported hook types:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_SETENV
The C library
.Xr setenv 3
function.
Any registered hooks will run before the C library implementation.
The
.Fa hook_fn
field should
be a function that matches the following typedef:
.Bd -literal
typedef int (*sudo_hook_fn_setenv_t)(const char *name,
   const char *value, int overwrite, void *closure);
.Ed
.Pp
If the registered hook does not match the typedef the results are
unspecified.
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_UNSETENV
The C library
.Xr unsetenv 3
function.
Any registered hooks will run before the C library implementation.
The
.Fa hook_fn
field should
be a function that matches the following typedef:
.Bd -literal
typedef int (*sudo_hook_fn_unsetenv_t)(const char *name,
   void *closure);
.Ed
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_GETENV
The C library
.Xr getenv 3
function.
Any registered hooks will run before the C library implementation.
The
.Fa hook_fn
field should
be a function that matches the following typedef:
.Bd -literal
typedef int (*sudo_hook_fn_getenv_t)(const char *name,
   char **value, void *closure);
.Ed
.Pp
If the registered hook does not match the typedef the results are
unspecified.
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_PUTENV
The C library
.Xr putenv 3
function.
Any registered hooks will run before the C library implementation.
The
.Fa hook_fn
field should
be a function that matches the following typedef:
.Bd -literal
typedef int (*sudo_hook_fn_putenv_t)(char *string,
   void *closure);
.Ed
.Pp
If the registered hook does not match the typedef the results are
unspecified.
.El
.It Fa hook_fn
.Bd -literal -compact
sudo_hook_fn_t hook_fn;
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa hook_fn
field should be set to the plugin's hook implementation.
The actual function arguments will vary depending on the
.Fa hook_type
(see
.Fa hook_type
above).
In all cases, the
.Fa closure
field of
.Vt struct sudo_hook
is passed as the last function parameter.
This can be used to pass arbitrary data to the plugin's hook implementation.
.Pp
The function return value may be one of the following:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_RET_ERROR
The hook function encountered an error.
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_RET_NEXT
The hook completed without error, go on to the next hook (including
the system implementation if applicable).
For example, a
.Xr getenv 3
hook might return
.Dv SUDO_HOOK_RET_NEXT
if the specified variable was not found in the private copy of the environment.
.It Dv SUDO_HOOK_RET_STOP
The hook completed without error, stop processing hooks for this invocation.
This can be used to replace the system implementation.
For example, a
.Fa setenv
hook that operates on a private copy of
the environment but leaves
.Va environ
unchanged.
.El
.El
.Pp
Care must be taken when hooking C library functions,
it is very easy to create an infinite loop.
For example, a
.Xr getenv 3
hook that calls the
.Xr snprintf 3
function may create a loop if the
.Xr snprintf 3
implementation calls
.Xr getenv 3
to check the locale.
To prevent this, you may wish to use a static variable in the hook
function to guard against nested calls.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
static int in_progress = 0; /* avoid recursion */
if (in_progress)
    return SUDO_HOOK_RET_NEXT;
in_progress = 1;
\&...
in_progress = 0;
return SUDO_HOOK_RET_STOP;

.Ss Event API
When
.Nm sudo
runs a command, it uses an event loop to service signals and I/O.
Events may be triggered based on time, a file or socket descriptor
becoming ready, or due to receipt of a signal.
Starting with API version 1.15, it is possible for a plugin to
participate in this event loop by calling the
.Fn event_alloc
function.
.Pp
.Em Event structure
.Pp
Events are described by the following structure:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -compact
typedef void (*sudo_plugin_ev_callback_t)(int fd, int what, void *closure);

struct sudo_plugin_event {
    int (*set)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, int fd, int events,
        sudo_plugin_ev_callback_t callback, void *closure);
    int (*add)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, struct timespec *timeout);
    int (*del)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
    int (*pending)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, int events,
        struct timespec *ts);
    int (*fd)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
    void (*setbase)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, void *base);
    void (*loopbreak)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
    void (*free)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
};
.Ed
.Pp
A
.Vt struct sudo_plugin_event
contains the following function pointers:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa set
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*set)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, int fd, int events,
    sudo_plugin_ev_callback_t callback, void *closure);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn set
function takes the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Vt struct sudo_plugin_event * Ns Fa pev
A pointer to the
.Vt struct sudo_plugin_event
itself.
.It Fa fd
The file or socket descriptor for I/O-based events or the signal
number for signal events.
For time-based events,
.Fa fd
must be \-1.
.It Fa events
The following values determine what will trigger the event callback:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_TIMEOUT
callback is run after the specified timeout expires
.It Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_READ
callback is run when the file descriptor is readable
.It Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_WRITE
callback is run when the file descriptor is writable
.It Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_PERSIST
event is persistent and remains enabled until explicitly deleted
.It Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_SIGNAL
callback is run when the specified signal is received
.El
.Pp
The
.Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_PERSIST
flag may be ORed with any of the event types.
It is also possible to OR
.Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_READ
and
.Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_WRITE
together to run the callback when a descriptor is ready to be
either read from or written to.
All other event values are mutually exclusive.
.It Vt sudo_plugin_ev_callback_t Fa callback
.Bd -literal -compact
typedef void (*sudo_plugin_ev_callback_t)(int fd, int what,
    void *closure);
.Ed
.Pp
The function to call when an event is triggered.
The
.Fn callback
function is run with the following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa fd
The file or socket descriptor for I/O-based events or the signal
number for signal events.
.It Fa what
The event type that triggered that callback.
For events that have multiple event types (for example
.Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_READ
and
.Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_WRITE )
or have an associated timeout,
.Fa what
can be used to determine why the callback was run.
.It Fa closure
The generic pointer that was specified in the
.Fn set
function.
.El
.It Fa closure
A generic pointer that will be passed to the callback function.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn set
function returns 1 on success, and \-1 if a error occurred.
.It Fa add
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*add)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, struct timespec *timeout);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn add
function adds the event
.Fa pev
to
.Nm sudo Ns No 's
event loop.
The event must have previously been initialized via the
.Fn set
function.
If the
.Fa timeout
argument is not NULL, it should specify a (relative) timeout after
which the event will be triggered if the main event criteria has
not been met.
This is often used to implement an I/O timeout where the event
will fire if a descriptor is not ready within a certain time
period.
If the event is already present in the event loop, its
.Fa timeout
will be adjusted to match the new value, if any.
.Pp
The
.Fn add
function returns 1 on success, and \-1 if a error occurred.
.It Fa del
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*del)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn del
function deletes the event
.Fa pev
from
.Nm sudo Ns No 's
event loop.
Deleted events can be added back via the
.Fn add
function.
.Pp
The
.Fn del
function returns 1 on success, and \-1 if a error occurred.
.It Fa pending
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*pending)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, int events,
    struct timespec *ts);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn pending
function can be used to determine whether one or more events is pending.
The
.Fa events
argument specifies which events to check for.
See the
.Fn set
function for a list of valid event types.
If
.Dv SUDO_PLUGIN_EV_TIMEOUT
is specified in
.Fa events ,
the event has an associated timeout and the
.Fa ts
pointer is non-NULL, it will be filled in with the remaining time.
.It Fa fd
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*fd)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn fd
function returns the descriptor or signal number associated with
the event
.Fa pev .
.It Fa setbase
.Bd -literal -compact
void (*setbase)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev, void *base);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn setbase
function sets the underlying event
.Fa base
for
.Fa pev
to the specified value.
This can be used to move an event created via
.Fn event_alloc
to a new event loop allocated by sudo's event subsystem.
If
.Fa base
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fa pev Ns 's
event base is reset to the default value, which corresponds to
.Nm sudo Ns 's
main event loop.
Using this function requires linking the plugin with the sudo_util
library.
It is unlikely to be used outside of the
.Nm sudoers
plugin.
.It Fa loopbreak
.Bd -literal -compact
void (*loopbreak)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn loopbreak
function causes
.Nm sudo Ns No 's
event loop to exit immediately and the running command to be terminated.
.It Fa free
.Bd -literal -compact
void (*free)(struct sudo_plugin_event *pev);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn free
function deletes the event
.Fa pev
from the event loop and frees the memory associated with it.
.El
.Ss Remote command execution
The
.Nm sudo
front-end does not support running remote commands.
However, starting with
.Nm sudo
1.8.8, the
.Fl h
option may be used to specify a remote host that is passed
to the policy plugin.
A plugin may also accept a
.Em runas_user
in the form of
.Dq user@hostname
which will work with older versions of
.Nm sudo .
It is anticipated that remote commands will be supported by executing a
.Dq helper
program.
The policy plugin should setup the execution environment such that the
.Nm sudo
front-end will run the helper which, in turn, will connect to the
remote host and run the command.
.Pp
For example, the policy plugin could utilize
.Nm ssh
to perform remote command execution.
The helper program would be responsible for running
.Nm ssh
with the proper options to use a private key or certificate
that the remote host will accept and run a program
on the remote host that would setup the execution environment
accordingly.
.Pp
Remote
.Nm sudoedit
functionality must be handled by the policy plugin, not
.Nm sudo
itself as the front-end has no knowledge that a remote command is
being executed.
This may be addressed in a future revision of the plugin API.
.Ss Conversation API
If the plugin needs to interact with the user, it may do so via the
.Fn conversation
function.
A plugin should not attempt to read directly from the standard input
or the user's terminal (neither of which are guaranteed to exist).
The caller must include a trailing newline in
.Fa msg
if one is to be printed.
.Pp
A
.Fn printf Ns -style
function is also available that can be used to display informational
or error messages to the user, which is usually more convenient for
simple messages where no use input is required.
.Pp
.Em Conversation function structures
.Pp
The conversation function takes as arguments pointers to the following
structures:
.Bd -literal
struct sudo_conv_message {
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF  0x0001 /* do not echo user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_ON   0x0002 /* echo user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG        0x0003 /* error message */
#define SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG         0x0004 /* informational message */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK      0x0005 /* mask user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OK   0x1000 /* flag: allow echo if no tty */
#define SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY       0x2000 /* flag: use tty if possible */
    int msg_type;
    int timeout;
    const char *msg;
};

#define SUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX      1023

struct sudo_conv_reply {
    char *reply;
};

typedef int (*sudo_conv_callback_fn_t)(int signo, void *closure);
struct sudo_conv_callback {
    unsigned int version;
    void *closure;
    sudo_conv_callback_fn_t on_suspend;
    sudo_conv_callback_fn_t on_resume;
};
.Ed
.Pp
Pointers to the
.Fn conversation
and
.Fn printf Ns -style
functions are passed
in to the plugin's
.Fn open
function when the plugin is initialized.
The following type definitions can be used in the declaration of the
.Fn open
function:
.Bd -literal
typedef int (*sudo_conv_t)(int num_msgs,
    const struct sudo_conv_message msgs[],
    struct sudo_conv_reply replies[], struct sudo_conv_callback *callback);

typedef int (*sudo_printf_t)(int msg_type, const char * restrict fmt, ...);
.Ed
.Pp
To use the
.Fn conversation
function, the plugin must pass an array of
.Vt struct sudo_conv_message
and
.Vt struct sudo_conv_reply .
There must be a
.Vt struct sudo_conv_message
and
.Vt struct sudo_conv_reply
for each message in the conversation, that is, both arrays must
have the same number of elements.
Each
.Vt struct sudo_conv_reply
must have its
.Fa reply
member initialized to
.Dv NULL .
The
.Vt struct sudo_conv_callback
pointer, if not
.Dv NULL ,
should contain function pointers to be called when the
.Nm sudo
process is suspended and/or resumed during conversation input.
The
.Fa on_suspend
and
.Fa on_resume
functions are called with the signal that caused
.Nm sudo
to be suspended and the
.Fa closure
pointer from the
.Vt struct sudo_conv_callback .
These functions should return 0 on success and \-1 on error.
On error, the conversation will end and the conversation function
will return a value of \-1.
The intended use is to allow the plugin to release resources, such as locks,
that should not be held indefinitely while suspended and then reacquire them
when the process is resumed.
The functions are not actually invoked from within a signal handler.
.Pp
The
.Fa msg_type
must be set to one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF
Prompt the user for input with echo disabled;
this is generally used for passwords.
The reply will be stored in the
.Fa replies
array, and it will never be
.Dv NULL .
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_ON
Prompt the user for input with echo enabled.
The reply will be stored in the
.Fa replies
array, and it will never be
.Dv NULL .
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG
Display an error message.
The message is written to the standard error unless the
.Dv SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY
flag is set, in which case it is written to the user's terminal if possible.
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG
Display a message.
The message is written to the standard output unless the
.Dv SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY
flag is set, in which case it is written to the user's terminal if possible.
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK
Prompt the user for input but echo an asterisk character for each
character read.
The reply will be stored in the
.Fa replies
array, and it will never be
.Dv NULL .
This can be used to provide visual feedback to the user while reading
sensitive information that should not be displayed.
.El
.Pp
In addition to the above values, the following flag bits may also be set:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OK
Allow input to be read when echo cannot be disabled
when the message type is
.Dv SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF
or
.Dv SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK .
By default,
.Nm sudo
will refuse to read input if the echo cannot be disabled for those
message types.
.It Dv SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY
When displaying a message via
.Dv SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG
or
.Dv SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG ,
try to write the message to the user's terminal.
If the terminal is unavailable, the standard error or standard output
will be used, depending upon whether
.Dv SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG
or
.Dv SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG
was used.
The user's terminal is always used when possible for input,
this flag is only used for output.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa timeout
in seconds until the prompt will wait for no more input.
A zero value implies an infinite timeout.
.Pp
The plugin is responsible for freeing the reply buffer located in each
.Vt struct sudo_conv_reply ,
if it is not
.Dv NULL .
.Dv SUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX
represents the maximum length of the reply buffer (not including
the trailing NUL character).
In practical terms, this is the longest password
.Nm sudo
will support.
.Pp
The
.Fn printf Ns -style
function uses the same underlying mechanism as the
.Fn conversation
function but only supports
.Dv SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG
and
.Dv SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG
for the
.Fa msg_type
parameter.
It can be more convenient than using the
.Fn conversation
function if no user reply is needed and supports standard
.Fn printf
escape sequences.
.Pp
See the sample plugin for an example of the
.Fn conversation
function usage.
.Ss Plugin invocation order
As of
.Nm sudo
1.9.0, the plugin
.Fn open
and
.Fn close
functions are called in the
following order:
.Bl -enum
.It
audit open
.It
policy open
.It
approval open
.It
approval close
.It
I/O log open
.It
command runs
.It
command exits
.It
I/O log close
.It
policy close
.It
audit close
.It
sudo exits
.El
.Pp
Prior to
.Nm sudo
1.9.0, the I/O log
.Fn close
function was called
.Em after
the policy
.Fn close
function.
.Ss Sudoers group plugin API
The
.Nm sudoers
plugin supports its own plugin interface to allow non-Unix
group lookups.
This can be used to query a group source other than the standard Unix
group database.
Two sample group plugins are bundled with
.Nm sudo ,
.Em group_file ,
and
.Em system_group ,
are detailed in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@ .
Third party group plugins include a QAS AD plugin available from Quest Software.
.Pp
A group plugin must declare and populate a
.Vt struct sudoers_group_plugin
in the global scope.
This structure contains pointers to the functions that implement plugin
initialization, cleanup, and group lookup.
.Bd -literal
struct sudoers_group_plugin {
    unsigned int version;
    int (*init)(int version, sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf,
        char *const argv[]);
    void (*cleanup)(void);
    int (*query)(const char *user, const char *group,
        const struct passwd *pwd);
};
.Ed
.Pp
A
.Vt struct sudoers_group_plugin
has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa version
The
.Fa version
field should be set to GROUP_API_VERSION.
.Pp
This allows
.Nm sudoers
to determine the API version the group plugin
was built against.
.It Fa init
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*init)(int version, sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf,
    char *const argv[]);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn init
function is called after
.Em sudoers
has been parsed but
before any policy checks.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure (or if the plugin is not configured),
and \-1 if a error occurred.
If an error occurs, the plugin may call the
.Fn plugin_printf
function with
.Dv SUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG
to present additional error information to the user.
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa version
The version passed in by
.Nm sudoers
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the group plugin API supported by
.Nm sudoers .
.It Fa plugin_printf
A pointer to a
.Fn printf Ns -style
function that may be used to display informational or error message to the user.
Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.It Fa argv
A
.Dv NULL Ns -terminated
array of arguments generated from the
.Em group_plugin
option in
.Em sudoers .
If no arguments were given,
.Fa argv
will be
.Dv NULL .
.El
.It Fa cleanup
.Bd -literal -compact
void (*cleanup)();
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn cleanup
function is called when
.Nm sudoers
has finished its
group checks.
The plugin should free any memory it has allocated and close open file handles.
.It Fa query
.Bd -literal -compact
int (*query)(const char *user, const char *group,
    const struct passwd *pwd);
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn query
function is used to ask the group plugin whether
.Fa user
is a member of
.Fa group .
.Pp
The function arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fa user
The name of the user being looked up in the external group database.
.It Fa group
The name of the group being queried.
.It Fa pwd
The password database entry for
.Fa user ,
if any.
If
.Fa user
is not
present in the password database,
.Fa pwd
will be
.Dv NULL .

.Sh PLUGIN API CHANGELOG
The following revisions have been made to the Sudo Plugin API.
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Version 1.0
Initial API version.
.It Version 1.1 (sudo 1.8.0)
The I/O logging plugin's
.Fn open
function was modified to take the
.Fa command_info
list as an argument.
.It Version 1.2 (sudo 1.8.5)
The Policy and I/O logging plugins'
.Fn open
functions are now passed
a list of plugin parameters if any are specified in
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ .
.Pp
A simple hooks API has been introduced to allow plugins to hook in to the
system's environment handling functions.
.Pp
The
.Fn init_session
Policy plugin function is now passed a pointer
to the user environment which can be updated as needed.
This can be used to merge in environment variables stored in the PAM
handle before a command is run.
.It Version 1.3 (sudo 1.8.7)
Support for the
.Em exec_background
entry has been added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
.Pp
The
.Em max_groups
and
.Em plugin_dir
entries were added to the
.Fa settings
list.
.Pp
The
.Fn version
and
.Fn close
functions are now optional.
Previously, a missing
.Fn version
or
.Fn close
function would result in a crash.
If no policy plugin
.Fn close
function is defined, a default
.Fn close
function will be provided by the
.Nm sudo
front-end that displays a warning if the command could not be
executed.
.Pp
The
.Nm sudo
front-end now installs default signal handlers to trap common signals
while the plugin functions are run.
.It Version 1.4 (sudo 1.8.8)
The
.Em remote_host
entry was added to the
.Fa settings
list.
.It Version 1.5 (sudo 1.8.9)
The
.Em preserve_fds
entry was added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
.It Version 1.6 (sudo 1.8.11)
The behavior when an I/O logging plugin returns an error
.Pq \-1
has changed.
Previously, the
.Nm sudo
front-end took no action when the
.Fn log_ttyin ,
.Fn log_ttyout ,
.Fn log_stdin ,
.Fn log_stdout ,
or
.Fn log_stderr
function returned an error.
.Pp
The behavior when an I/O logging plugin returns 0 has changed.
Previously, output from the command would be displayed to the
terminal even if an output logging function returned 0.
.It Version 1.7 (sudo 1.8.12)
The
.Em plugin_path
entry was added to the
.Fa settings
list.
.Pp
The
.Em debug_flags
entry now starts with a debug file path name and may occur multiple
times if there are multiple plugin-specific Debug lines in the
.Xr sudo.conf @mansectform@ file.
.It Version 1.8 (sudo 1.8.15)
The
.Em sudoedit_checkdir
and
.Em sudoedit_follow
entries were added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
The default value of
.Em sudoedit_checkdir
was changed to true in sudo 1.8.16.
.Pp
The sudo
.Fn conversation
function now takes a pointer to a
.Vt struct sudo_conv_callback
as its fourth argument.
The
.Vt sudo_conv_t
definition has been updated to match.
The plugin must specify that it supports plugin API version 1.8 or higher
to receive a conversation function pointer that supports this argument.
.It Version 1.9 (sudo 1.8.16)
The
.Em execfd
entry was added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
.It Version 1.10 (sudo 1.8.19)
The
.Em umask
entry was added to the
.Fa user_info
list.
The
.Em iolog_group ,
.Em iolog_mode ,
and
.Em iolog_user
entries were added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
.It Version 1.11 (sudo 1.8.20)
The
.Em timeout
entry was added to the
.Fa settings
list.
.It Version 1.12 (sudo 1.8.21)
The
.Fn change_winsize
function was added to
.Vt struct io_plugin .
.It Version 1.13 (sudo 1.8.26)
The
.Fn log_suspend
function was added to
.Vt struct io_plugin .
.It Version 1.14 (sudo 1.8.29)
The
.Em umask_override
entry was added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
.It Version 1.15 (sudo 1.9.0)
The
.Em cwd_optional
entry was added to the
.Fa command_info
list.
.Pp
The
.Fn event_alloc
function was added to
.Vt struct policy_plugin
and
.Vt struct io_plugin .
.Pp
The
.Fa errstr
argument was added to the policy and I/O plugin functions
which the plugin function can use to return an error string.
This string may be used by the audit plugin to report failure or
error conditions set by the other plugins.
.Pp
The
.Fn close
function is now is called regardless of whether or not a command
was actually executed.
This makes it possible for plugins to perform cleanup even when a
command was not run.
.Pp
.Dv SUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX
has increased from 255 to 1023 bytes.
.Pp
Support for audit and approval plugins was added.
.It Version 1.16 (sudo 1.9.3)
