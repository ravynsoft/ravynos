.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
utility accepts one or more security policies in either
\fIsudoers\fR
or LDIF format as input, and generates a single
policy of the specified format as output.
The default input format is
\fIsudoers.\fR
The default output format is LDIF.
It is only possible to convert a policy file that is syntactically correct.
.PP
If no
\fIinput_file\fR
is specified, or if it is
\(oq-\(cq,
the policy is read from the standard input.
Input files may be optionally prefixed with a host name followed by a colon
(\(oq:\&\(cq)
to make the policy rules specific to a host when merging multiple files.
By default, the result is written to the standard output.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 8n
\fB\-b\fR \fIdn\fR, \fB\--base\fR=\fIdn\fR
The base DN (distinguished name) that will be used when performing
LDAP queries.
Typically this is of the form
\(lqou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com\(rq
for the domain my-domain.com.
If this option is not specified, the value of the
\fRSUDOERS_BASE\fR
environment variable will be used instead.
Only necessary when converting to LDIF format.
.TP 8n
\fB\-c\fR \fIconf_file\fR, \fB\--config\fR=\fIconf_file\fR
Specify the path to the configuration file.
Defaults to
\fI@sysconfdir@/cvtsudoers.conf\fR.
.TP 8n
\fB\-d\fR \fIdeftypes\fR, \fB\--defaults\fR=\fIdeftypes\fR
Only convert
\fIDefaults\fR
entries of the specified types.
One or more
\fIDefaults\fR
types may be specified, separated by a comma
(\(oq\&,\(cq).
The supported types are:
.PP
.RS 8n
.PD 0
.TP 9n
all
All Defaults entries.
.PD
.TP 9n
global
Global Defaults entries that are applied regardless of
user, runas, host, or command.
.TP 9n
user
Per-user Defaults entries.
.TP 9n
runas
Per-runas user Defaults entries.
.TP 9n
host
Per-host Defaults entries.
.TP 9n
command
Per-command Defaults entries.
.PP
See the
\fBDefaults\fR
section in
sudoers(@mansectform@)
for more information.
.sp
If the
\fB\-d\fR
option is not specified, all
\fIDefaults\fR
entries will be converted.
.RE
.TP 8n
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\--expand-aliases\fR
Expand aliases in
\fIinput_file\fR.
Aliases are preserved by default when the output
\fIformat\fR
is JSON or sudoers.
.TP 8n
\fB\-f\fR \fIoutput_format\fR, \fB\--output-format\fR=\fIoutput_format\fR
Specify the output format (case-insensitive).
The following formats are supported:
.PP
.RS 8n
.PD 0
.TP 9n
CSV
CSV (comma-separated value) files are often used by spreadsheets
and report generators.
See
\fICSV output format\fR
for more details.
.PD
.TP 9n
JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually easier for
third-party applications to consume than the traditional
\fIsudoers\fR
format.
The various values have explicit types which removes much of the
ambiguity of the
\fIsudoers\fR
format.
See
\fIJSON output format\fR
for more details.
.TP 9n
LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be imported into an LDAP
server for use with
sudoers.ldap(@mansectform@).
.sp
Conversion to LDIF has the following limitations:
.PP
.RS 9n
.PD 0
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
Command, host, runas, and user-specific Defaults lines cannot be
translated as they don't have an equivalent in the sudoers LDAP schema.
.PD
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
Command, host, runas, and user aliases are not supported by the
sudoers LDAP schema so they are expanded during the conversion.
.PD 0
.PP
.RE
.PD
.TP 9n
sudoers
Traditional sudoers format.
A new sudoers file will be reconstructed from the parsed input file.
Comments are not preserved and data from any include files will be
output inline.
.PD 0
.PP
.RE
.PD
.TP 8n
\fB\--group-file\fR=\fIfile\fR
When the
\fB\-M\fR
option is also specified, perform group queries using
\fIfile\fR
instead of the system group database.
.TP 8n
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\--help\fR
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.TP 8n
\fB\-i\fR \fIinput_format\fR, \fB\--input-format\fR=\fIinput_format\fR
Specify the input format.
The following formats are supported:
.PP
.RS 8n
.PD 0
.TP 9n
LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be exported from an LDAP
server to convert security policies used by
sudoers.ldap(@mansectform@).
If a base DN (distinguished name) is specified, only sudoRole objects
that match the base DN will be processed.
Not all sudoOptions specified in a sudoRole can be translated from
LDIF to sudoers format.
.PD
.TP 9n
sudoers
Traditional sudoers format.
This is the default input format.
.PD 0
.PP
.RE
.PD
.TP 8n
\fB\-I\fR \fIincrement\fR, \fB\--increment\fR=\fIincrement\fR
When generating LDIF output, increment each sudoOrder attribute by
the specified number.
Defaults to an increment of 1.
.TP 8n
\fB\-l\fR \fIlog_file\fR, \fB\--logfile\fR=\fIlog_file\fR
Log conversion warnings to
\fIlog_file\fR
instead of to the standard error.
This is particularly useful when merging multiple
\fIsudoers\fR
files, which can generate a large number of warnings.
.TP 8n
\fB\-m\fR \fIfilter\fR, \fB\--match\fR=\fIfilter\fR
Only output rules that match the specified
\fIfilter\fR.
A
\fIfilter\fR
expression is made up of one or more
\fBkey =\fR \fIvalue\fR
pairs, separated by a comma
(\(oq\&,\(cq).
The
\fBkey\fR
may be
\(lqcmnd\(rq
(or \(lqcmd\(rq),
\(lqhost\(rq,
\(lqgroup\(rq,
or
\(lquser\(rq.
For example,
\fBuser\fR = \fIoperator\fR
or
\fBhost\fR = \fIwww\fR.
An upper-case
\fICmnd_Alias\fR,
\fIHost_alias\fR,
or
\fIUser_Alias\fR
may be specified as the
\(lqcmnd\(rq,
\(lqhost\(rq,
or
\(lquser\(rq.
.sp
A matching
\fIsudoers\fR
rule may also include users, groups, and hosts that are not part of the
\fIfilter\fR.
This can happen when a rule includes multiple users, groups, or hosts.
To prune out any non-matching user, group, or host from the rules, the
\fB\-p\fR
option may be used.
.sp
By default, the password and group databases are not consulted when matching
against the filter so the users and groups do not need to be present
on the local system (see the
\fB\-M\fR
option).
Only aliases that are referenced by the filtered policy rules will
be displayed.
.TP 8n
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\--match-local\fR
When the
\fB\-m\fR
option is also specified, use password and group database information
when matching users and groups in the filter.
Only users and groups in the filter that exist on the local system will match,
and a user's groups will automatically be added to the filter.
If the
\fB\-M\fR
is
\fInot\fR
specified, users and groups in the filter do not need to exist on the
local system, but all groups used for matching must be explicitly listed
in the filter.
.TP 8n
\fB\-o\fR \fIoutput_file\fR, \fB\--output\fR=\fIoutput_file\fR
Write the converted output to
\fIoutput_file\fR.
If no
\fIoutput_file\fR
is specified, or if it is
\(oq-\(cq,
the converted
\fIsudoers\fR
policy will be written to the standard output.
.TP 8n
\fB\-O\fR \fIstart_point\fR, \fB\--order-start\fR=\fIstart_point\fR
When generating LDIF output, use the number specified by
\fIstart_point\fR
in the sudoOrder attribute of the first sudoRole object.
Subsequent sudoRole object use a sudoOrder value generated by adding an
\fIincrement\fR,
see the
\fB\-I\fR
option for details.
Defaults to a starting point of 1.
A starting point of 0 will disable the generation of sudoOrder
attributes in the resulting LDIF file.
.TP 8n
\fB\--passwd-file\fR=\fIfile\fR
When the
\fB\-M\fR
option is also specified, perform passwd queries using
\fIfile\fR
instead of the system passwd database.
.TP 8n
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\--prune-matches\fR
When the
\fB\-m\fR
option is also specified,
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
will prune out non-matching users, groups, and hosts from
matching entries.
.TP 8n
\fB\-P\fR \fIpadding\fR, \fB\--padding\fR=\fIpadding\fR
When generating LDIF output, construct the initial sudoOrder value by
concatenating
\fIorder_start\fR
and
\fIincrement\fR,
padding the
\fIincrement\fR
with zeros until it consists of
\fIpadding\fR
digits.
For example, if
\fIorder_start\fR
is 1027,
\fIpadding\fR
is 3, and
\fIincrement\fR
is 1, the value of sudoOrder for the first entry will be 1027000,
followed by 1027001, 1027002, etc.
If the number of sudoRole entries is larger than the padding would allow,
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
will exit with an error.
By default, no padding is performed.
.TP 8n
\fB\-s\fR \fIsections\fR, \fB\--suppress\fR=\fIsections\fR
Suppress the output of specific
\fIsections\fR
of the security policy.
One or more section names may be specified, separated by a comma
(\(oq\&,\(cq).
The supported section name are:
\fBdefaults\fR,
\fBaliases\fR
and
\fBprivileges\fR
(which may be shortened to
\fBprivs\fR).
.TP 8n
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\--version\fR
Print the
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
and
\fIsudoers\fR
grammar versions and exit.
.SS "Merging multiple files"
When multiple input files are specified,
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
will attempt to merge them into a single policy file.
It is assumed that user and group names are consistent among
the policy files to be merged.
For example, user
\(lqbob\(rq
on one host is the same as user
\(lqbob\(rq
on another host.
.PP
When merging policy files, it is possible to prefix the input file name
with a host name, separated by a colon
(\(oq:\&\(cq).
When the files are merged, the host name will be used to restrict
the policy rules to that specific host where possible.
.PP
The merging process is performed as follows:
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
Each input file is parsed into internal sudoers data structures.
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
Aliases are merged and renamed as necessary to avoid conflicts.
In the event of a conflict, the first alias found is left as-is and
subsequent aliases of the same name are renamed with a numeric suffix
separated with a underscore
(\(oq_\(cq).
For example, if there are two different aliases named
\fRSERVERS\fR,
the first will be left as-is and the second will be renamed
\fRSERVERS_1\fR.
References to the renamed alias are also updated in the policy file.
Duplicate aliases (those with identical contents) are pruned.
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
Defaults settings are merged and duplicates are removed.
If there are conflicts in the Defaults settings, a warning is emitted for
each conflict.
If a host name is specified with the input file,
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
will change the global Defaults settings in that file to be host-specific.
A warning is emitted for command, user, or runas-specific Defaults settings
which cannot be made host-specific.
.TP 3n
\fB\(bu\fR
Per-user rules are merged and duplicates are removed.
If a host name is specified with the input file,
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
will change rules that specify a host name of
\fBALL\fR
to the host name associated with the policy file being merged.
The merging of rules is currently fairly simplistic but will be
improved in a later release.
.PP
It is possible to merge policy files with differing formats.
.SS "The cvtsudoers.conf file"
Options in the form
\(lqkeyword = value\(rq
may also be specified in a configuration file,
\fI@sysconfdir@/cvtsudoers.conf\fR
by default.

JSON format may contain any of the following top-level objects:
.TP 6n
Defaults
An array of objects, each containing an
\fIOptions\fR
array and an optional
\fIBinding\fR
array.
.sp
The
\fIOptions\fR
array consists of one or more objects, each containing a
\(lqname:value\(rq
pair that corresponds to a
\fIsudoers\fR
\fIDefaults\fR

.sp
The
\fICmnd_Specs\fR
array consists of one or more JSON objects describing a command that
may be run.
Each
\fICmnd_Specs\fR
is made up of a
\fICommands\fR
array, an optional
\fIrunasusers\fR
array, an optional
\fIrunasgroups\fR
array, and an optional
\fIOptions array.\fR
.sp
The
\fICommands\fR
array consists of one or more objects containing
\(lqname:value\(rq
pair elements.
The following names and values are supported:
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 9n
command
A string containing the command to run.
The special value
\fBALL\fR
it will match any command.
.PD
.TP 9n
negated
A boolean value that, if true, will negate any comparison performed
with the object.
.TP 9n
sha224
A string containing the SHA224 digest of the
\fIcommand\fR.
.TP 9n
sha256
A string containing the SHA256 digest of the
\fIcommand\fR.

sha512
A string containing the SHA512 digest of the
\fIcommand\fR.
.PP
The
\fIrunasusers\fR
array consists of objects describing users the command may be run as.
Each object contains a
\(lqname:value\(rq
pair and an optional
\fInegated\fR
entry, which will negate any comparison performed with the object.
The name may be one of
\fInetgroup\fR,
\fInonunixgid\fR,
\fInonunixgroup\fR,
\fIrunasalias\fR,
\fIusergid\fR,
\fIusergroup\fR,
\fIuserid\fR,

\fIusername\fR.
If
\fIusername\fR
is set to the special value
\fBALL\fR,
it will match any user.
If
\fIusername\fR
is set to the empty string
\(lq\(rq,
it will match the invoking user.
.sp
The
\fIrunasgroups\fR
array consists of objects describing groups the command may be run as.
Each object contains a
\(lqname:value\(rq
pair and an optional
\fInegated\fR
entry, which will negate any comparison performed with the object.
The name may be one of
\fIrunasalias\fR,
\fIusergid\fR,
or

object.
Any
\fITag_Spec\fR
entries in
\fIsudoers\fR
are converted to
\fIOptions\fR.
A user with
\(lqsudo ALL\(rq
privileges will automatically have the
\fIsetenv\fR
option enabled to match the implicit behavior provided by
\fIsudoers\fR.
.sp
For example, the following
\fIsudoers\fR
entry:
.nf
.sp
.RS 6n
millert ALL = (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL, !/usr/bin/id
.RE

.SS "CSV output format"
CSV (comma-separated value) files are often used by spreadsheets
and report generators.
For CSV output,
\fBcvtsudoers\fR
double quotes strings that contain commas.
For each literal double quote character present inside the string,
two double quotes are output.
This method of quoting commas is compatible with most spreadsheet programs.
.PP
There are three possible sections in
\fBcvtsudoers\fR's
CSV output, each separated by a blank line:
.TP 6n
defaults
This section includes any
\fIDefaults\fR
settings in
\fIsudoers\fR.
The
\fIdefaults\fR
section begins with the following heading:
.nf

.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
The fields are as follows:
.TP 6n
defaults_type
The type of
\fIDefaults\fR
setting; one of
\fIdefaults\fR,
\fIdefaults_command\fR,
\fIdefaults_host\fR,
\fIdefaults_runas\fR,

\fIdefaults_user\fR.
.TP 6n
binding
For
\fIdefaults_command\fR,
\fIdefaults_host\fR,
\fIdefaults_runas\fR,
and
\fIdefaults_user\fR
this is the value that must match for the setting to be applied.
.TP 6n
name
The name of the
\fIDefaults\fR
setting.
.TP 6n
operator
The operator determines how the value is applied to the setting.
It may be either
\(oq=\(cq
(assignment),
\(oq+=\(cq
(append),
or
\(oq-=\(cq
(remove).
.TP 6n
value
.br
The setting's value, usually a string or, for
settings used in a boolean context,
\fItrue\fR
or
\fIfalse\fR.
.PD 0

.TP 6n
aliases
This section includes any
\fICmnd_Alias\fR
\fIHost_Alias\fR,
\fIRunas_Alias\fR,

alias_name
The name of the alias; a string starting with an upper-case letter that
consists of upper-case letters, digits, or underscores.
.TP 6n
members
A comma-separated list of members belonging to the alias.
Due to the use of commas,
\fImembers\fR
is surrounded by double quotes if it contains more than one member.
.PD 0
.PP
.RE
.PD
.TP 6n
rules
.br
This section includes the
\fIsudoers\fR
rules that grant privileges.

it will match any user.
If empty, the root user is assumed.
.TP 6n
rungroups
An optional comma-separated list of groups (or
\fIRunas_Alias\fRes)
the command may be run as.
If it contains more than one member, the value is surrounded by
double quotes.

it will match any group.
If empty, the
\fIrunuser\fR's
group is used.
.TP 6n
options
An optional list of
\fIDefaults\fR
settings to apply to the command.
Any
\fITag_Spec\fR
entries in
\fIsudoers\fR
are converted to
