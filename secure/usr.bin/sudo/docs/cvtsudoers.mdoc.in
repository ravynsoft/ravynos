.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility accepts one or more security policies in either
.Em sudoers
or LDIF format as input, and generates a single
policy of the specified format as output.
The default input format is
.Em sudoers.
The default output format is LDIF.
It is only possible to convert a policy file that is syntactically correct.
.Pp
If no
.Ar input_file
is specified, or if it is
.Ql - ,
the policy is read from the standard input.
Input files may be optionally prefixed with a host name followed by a colon
.Pq Ql :\&
to make the policy rules specific to a host when merging multiple files.
By default, the result is written to the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar dn , Fl -base Ns = Ns Ar dn
The base DN (distinguished name) that will be used when performing
LDAP queries.
Typically this is of the form
.Dq ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com
for the domain my-domain.com.
If this option is not specified, the value of the
.Ev SUDOERS_BASE
environment variable will be used instead.
Only necessary when converting to LDIF format.
.It Fl c Ar conf_file , Fl -config Ns = Ns Ar conf_file
Specify the path to the configuration file.
Defaults to
.Pa @sysconfdir@/cvtsudoers.conf .
.It Fl d Ar deftypes , Fl -defaults Ns = Ns Ar deftypes
Only convert
.Em Defaults
entries of the specified types.
One or more
.Em Defaults
types may be specified, separated by a comma
.Pq Ql \&, .
The supported types are:
.Bl -tag -width "command"
.It all
All Defaults entries.
.It global
Global Defaults entries that are applied regardless of
user, runas, host, or command.
.It user
Per-user Defaults entries.
.It runas
Per-runas user Defaults entries.
.It host
Per-host Defaults entries.
.It command
Per-command Defaults entries.
.El
.Pp
See the
.Sy Defaults
section in
.Xr sudoers @mansectform@
for more information.
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
option is not specified, all
.Em Defaults
entries will be converted.
.It Fl e , Fl -expand-aliases
Expand aliases in
.Ar input_file .
Aliases are preserved by default when the output
.Ar format
is JSON or sudoers.
.It Fl f Ar output_format , Fl -output-format Ns = Ns Ar output_format
Specify the output format (case-insensitive).
The following formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "sudoers"
.It CSV
CSV (comma-separated value) files are often used by spreadsheets
and report generators.
See
.Sx CSV output format
for more details.
.It JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files are usually easier for
third-party applications to consume than the traditional
.Em sudoers
format.
The various values have explicit types which removes much of the
ambiguity of the
.Em sudoers
format.
See
.Sx JSON output format
for more details.
.It LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be imported into an LDAP
server for use with
.Xr sudoers.ldap @mansectform@ .
.Pp
Conversion to LDIF has the following limitations:
.Bl -bullet -width 1n
.It
Command, host, runas, and user-specific Defaults lines cannot be
translated as they don't have an equivalent in the sudoers LDAP schema.
.It
Command, host, runas, and user aliases are not supported by the
sudoers LDAP schema so they are expanded during the conversion.
.El
.It sudoers
Traditional sudoers format.
A new sudoers file will be reconstructed from the parsed input file.
Comments are not preserved and data from any include files will be
output inline.
.El
.It Fl -group-file Ns = Ns Ar file
When the
.Fl M
option is also specified, perform group queries using
.Ar file
instead of the system group database.
.It Fl h , Fl -help
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl i Ar input_format , Fl -input-format Ns = Ns Ar input_format
Specify the input format.
The following formats are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "sudoers"
.It LDIF
LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) files can be exported from an LDAP
server to convert security policies used by
.Xr sudoers.ldap @mansectform@ .
If a base DN (distinguished name) is specified, only sudoRole objects
that match the base DN will be processed.
Not all sudoOptions specified in a sudoRole can be translated from
LDIF to sudoers format.
.It sudoers
Traditional sudoers format.
This is the default input format.
.El
.It Fl I Ar increment , Fl -increment Ns = Ns Ar increment
When generating LDIF output, increment each sudoOrder attribute by
the specified number.
Defaults to an increment of 1.
.It Fl l Ar log_file , Fl -logfile Ns = Ns Ar log_file
Log conversion warnings to
.Ar log_file
instead of to the standard error.
This is particularly useful when merging multiple
.Em sudoers
files, which can generate a large number of warnings.
.It Fl m Ar filter , Fl -match Ns = Ns Ar filter
Only output rules that match the specified
.Ar filter .
A
.Ar filter
expression is made up of one or more
.Sy key = Ar value
pairs, separated by a comma
.Pq Ql \&, .
The
.Sy key
may be
.Dq cmnd
.Pq or Dq cmd ,
.Dq host ,
.Dq group ,
or
.Dq user .
For example,
.Sy user No = Ar operator
or
.Sy host No = Ar www .
An upper-case
.Em Cmnd_Alias ,
.Em Host_alias ,
or
.Em User_Alias
may be specified as the
.Dq cmnd ,
.Dq host ,
or
.Dq user .
.Pp
A matching
.Em sudoers
rule may also include users, groups, and hosts that are not part of the
.Ar filter .
This can happen when a rule includes multiple users, groups, or hosts.
To prune out any non-matching user, group, or host from the rules, the
.Fl p
option may be used.
.Pp
By default, the password and group databases are not consulted when matching
against the filter so the users and groups do not need to be present
on the local system (see the
.Fl M
option).
Only aliases that are referenced by the filtered policy rules will
be displayed.
.It Fl M , Fl -match-local
When the
.Fl m
option is also specified, use password and group database information
when matching users and groups in the filter.
Only users and groups in the filter that exist on the local system will match,
and a user's groups will automatically be added to the filter.
If the
.Fl M
is
.Em not
specified, users and groups in the filter do not need to exist on the
local system, but all groups used for matching must be explicitly listed
in the filter.
.It Fl o Ar output_file , Fl -output Ns = Ns Ar output_file
Write the converted output to
.Ar output_file .
If no
.Ar output_file
is specified, or if it is
.Ql - ,
the converted
.Em sudoers
policy will be written to the standard output.
.It Fl O Ar start_point , Fl -order-start Ns = Ns Ar start_point
When generating LDIF output, use the number specified by
.Ar start_point
in the sudoOrder attribute of the first sudoRole object.
Subsequent sudoRole object use a sudoOrder value generated by adding an
.Ar increment ,
see the
.Fl I
option for details.
Defaults to a starting point of 1.
A starting point of 0 will disable the generation of sudoOrder
attributes in the resulting LDIF file.
.It Fl -passwd-file Ns = Ns Ar file
When the
.Fl M
option is also specified, perform passwd queries using
.Ar file
instead of the system passwd database.
.It Fl p , Fl -prune-matches
When the
.Fl m
option is also specified,
.Nm
will prune out non-matching users, groups, and hosts from
matching entries.
.It Fl P Ar padding , Fl -padding Ns = Ns Ar padding
When generating LDIF output, construct the initial sudoOrder value by
concatenating
.Ar order_start
and
.Ar increment ,
padding the
.Ar increment
with zeros until it consists of
.Ar padding
digits.
For example, if
.Ar order_start
is 1027,
.Ar padding
is 3, and
.Ar increment
is 1, the value of sudoOrder for the first entry will be 1027000,
followed by 1027001, 1027002, etc.
If the number of sudoRole entries is larger than the padding would allow,
.Nm
will exit with an error.
By default, no padding is performed.
.It Fl s Ar sections , Fl -suppress Ns = Ns Ar sections
Suppress the output of specific
.Ar sections
of the security policy.
One or more section names may be specified, separated by a comma
.Pq Ql \&, .
The supported section name are:
.Sy defaults ,
.Sy aliases
and
.Sy privileges
(which may be shortened to
.Sy privs ) .
.It Fl V , -version
Print the
.Nm
and
.Em sudoers
grammar versions and exit.
.El
.Ss Merging multiple files
When multiple input files are specified,
.Nm
will attempt to merge them into a single policy file.
It is assumed that user and group names are consistent among
the policy files to be merged.
For example, user
.Dq bob
on one host is the same as user
.Dq bob
on another host.
.Pp
When merging policy files, it is possible to prefix the input file name
with a host name, separated by a colon
.Pq Ql :\& .
When the files are merged, the host name will be used to restrict
the policy rules to that specific host where possible.
.Pp
The merging process is performed as follows:
.Bl -bullet -width 1n
.It
Each input file is parsed into internal sudoers data structures.
.It
Aliases are merged and renamed as necessary to avoid conflicts.
In the event of a conflict, the first alias found is left as-is and
subsequent aliases of the same name are renamed with a numeric suffix
separated with a underscore
.Pq Ql _ .
For example, if there are two different aliases named
.Dv SERVERS ,
the first will be left as-is and the second will be renamed
.Dv SERVERS_1 .
References to the renamed alias are also updated in the policy file.
Duplicate aliases (those with identical contents) are pruned.
.It
Defaults settings are merged and duplicates are removed.
If there are conflicts in the Defaults settings, a warning is emitted for
each conflict.
If a host name is specified with the input file,
.Nm
will change the global Defaults settings in that file to be host-specific.
A warning is emitted for command, user, or runas-specific Defaults settings
which cannot be made host-specific.
.It
Per-user rules are merged and duplicates are removed.
If a host name is specified with the input file,
.Nm
will change rules that specify a host name of
.Sy ALL
to the host name associated with the policy file being merged.
The merging of rules is currently fairly simplistic but will be
improved in a later release.
.El
.Pp
It is possible to merge policy files with differing formats.
.Ss The cvtsudoers.conf file
Options in the form
.Dq keyword = value
may also be specified in a configuration file,
.Pa @sysconfdir@/cvtsudoers.conf
by default.
The following keywords are recognized:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Sy defaults = Ar deftypes
See the description of the
.Fl d
command line option.
.It Sy expand_aliases = Ar yes | no
See the description of the
.Fl e
command line option.
.It Sy group_file = Ar file
See the description of the
.Fl -group-file
command line option.
.It Sy input_format = Ar ldif | sudoers
See the description of the
.Fl i
command line option.
.It Sy match = Ar filter
See the description of the
.Fl m
command line option.
.It Sy match_local = Ar yes | no
See the description of the

command line option.
.It Sy order_increment = Ar increment
See the description of the
.Fl I
command line option.
.It Sy order_start = Ar start_point
See the description of the
.Fl O
command line option.
.It Sy output_format = Ar csv | json | ldif | sudoers
See the description of the
.Fl f
command line option.
.It Sy padding = Ar padding
See the description of the
.Fl P
command line option.
.It Sy passwd_file = Ar file
See the description of the
.Fl -passwd-file
command line option.
.It Sy prune_matches = Ar yes | no
See the description of the
.Fl p
command line option.
.It Sy sudoers_base = Ar dn
See the description of the
.Fl b
command line option.
.It Sy suppress = Ar sections
See the description of the
.Fl s
command line option.
.El
.Pp
Options on the command line will override values from the
configuration file.
.Ss JSON output format
The
.Em sudoers
JSON format may contain any of the following top-level objects:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Defaults
An array of objects, each containing an
.Em Options
array and an optional
.Em Binding
array.
.Pp
The
.Em Options
array consists of one or more objects, each containing a
.Dq name:value
pair that corresponds to a
.Em sudoers
.Em Defaults
setting.
.Em Options
that operate on a list will also include an
.Em operation
entry in the object, with a value of
.Dq list_assign
for
.Ql = ,
.Dq list_add
for
.Ql += ,
or
.Dq list_remove
for
.Ql -= .
.Pp
The optional
.Em Binding
array consists of one or more objects, each containing a
.Dq name:value
pair and an optional
.Em negated
entry, which will negate any comparison performed with the object.
If a
.Em Binding
is present, the setting will only take effect if one of the specified
.Em command ,
.Em hostname ,
.Em netgroup ,
.Em networkaddr ,
.Em nonunixgid ,
.Em nonunixgroup ,
.Em usergid ,
.Em usergroup ,
.Em userid ,
.Em username ,
or alias entries match.
.Pp
For example, the following
.Em sudoers
entry:
.Bd -literal
Defaults@somehost set_home, env_keep += DISPLAY
.Ed
.Pp
converts to:
.Bd -literal
"Defaults": [
    {

.Ss CSV output format
CSV (comma-separated value) files are often used by spreadsheets
and report generators.
For CSV output,
.Nm
double quotes strings that contain commas.

.Bl -tag -width 24n
.It Pa @sysconfdir@/cvtsudoers.conf
default configuration for cvtsudoers
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Convert
.Pa /etc/sudoers
to LDIF (LDAP Data Interchange Format) where the
.Pa ldap.conf
file uses a
.Em sudoers_base
of my-domain,dc=com, storing the result in
.Pa sudoers.ldif :
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cvtsudoers -b ou=SUDOers,dc=my-domain,dc=com -o sudoers.ldif \e
             /etc/sudoers
.Ed
.Pp
Convert
.Pa /etc/sudoers
to JSON format, storing the result in
.Pa sudoers.json :
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cvtsudoers -f json -o sudoers.json /etc/sudoers
.Ed
.Pp
Parse
.Pa /etc/sudoers
and display only rules that match user
.Em ambrose
on host
.Em hastur :
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cvtsudoers -f sudoers -m user=ambrose,host=hastur /etc/sudoers
.Ed
.Pp
Same as above, but expand aliases and prune out any non-matching
users and hosts from the expanded entries.
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cvtsudoers -ep -f sudoers -m user=ambrose,host=hastur /etc/sudoers
.Ed
.Pp
Convert
.Pa sudoers.ldif
from LDIF to traditional
.Em sudoers
format:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cvtsudoers -i ldif -f sudoers -o sudoers.new sudoers.ldif
.Ed
.Pp
Merge a global
.Em sudoers
file with two host-specific policy files from the hosts
.Dq xyzzy
and
.Dq plugh :
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
$ cvtsudoers -f sudoers -o sudoers.merged sudoers \e
    xyzzy:sudoers.xyzzy plugh:sudoers.plugh
