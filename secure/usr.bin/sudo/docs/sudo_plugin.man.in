\fBsudo_plugin\fR
\- Sudo Plugin API
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Starting with version 1.8,
\fBsudo\fR
supports a plugin API
for policy and session logging.
Plugins may be compiled as dynamic shared objects (the default on
systems that support them) or compiled statically into the
\fBsudo\fR
binary itself.
By default, the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin provides audit, security policy and I/O logging capabilities.
Via the plugin API,
\fBsudo\fR
can be configured to use alternate plugins provided by third parties.
The plugins to be used are specified in the
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
file.
.PP
The API is versioned with a major and minor number.
The minor version number is incremented when additions are made.
The major number is incremented when incompatible changes are made.
A plugin should be check the version passed to it and make sure that the
major version matches.
.PP
The plugin API is defined by the
<\fIsudo_plugin.h\fR>
header file.
.SS "Policy plugin API"
A policy plugin must declare and populate a
\fIstruct policy_plugin\fR
in the global scope.
This structure contains pointers to the functions that implement the
\fBsudo\fR
policy checks.
The name of the symbol should be specified in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
along with a path to the plugin so that
\fBsudo\fR
can load it.

A
\fIstruct policy_plugin\fR
has the following fields:
.TP 6n
\fItype\fR
The
\fItype\fR
field should always be set to SUDO_POLICY_PLUGIN.
.TP 6n
\fIversion\fR
The
\fIversion\fR
field should be set to
\fRSUDO_API_VERSION\fR.
.sp
This allows
\fBsudo\fR
to determine the API version the plugin was
built against.
.TP 6n
\fIopen\fR
.nf
.RS 6n
int (*open)(unsigned int version, sudo_conv_t conversation,
    sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf, char * const settings[],
    char * const user_info[], char * const user_env[],
    char * const plugin_options[], const char **errstr);
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
Returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
\fBsudo\fR
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
\fBconversation\fR()
or
\fBsudo_plugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIversion\fR
The version passed in by
\fBsudo\fR
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
\fIconversation\fR
A pointer to the
\fBconversation\fR()
function that can be used by the plugin to interact with the user (see
\fIConversation API\fR
for details).
Returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
\fIsudo_plugin_printf\fR
A pointer to a
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function that may be used to display informational or error messages (see
\fIConversation API\fR
for details).
Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
\fIsettings\fR
A vector of user-supplied
\fBsudo\fR
settings in the form of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
\fBsudo\fR.
As such, they will only be present when the corresponding option has
been specified on the command line.
.sp
When parsing
\fIsettings\fR,
the plugin should split on the
\fBfirst\fR
equal sign
(\(oq=\(cq)
since the
\fIname\fR
field will never include one itself but the
\fIvalue\fR
might.
.sp
The following values may be set by
\fBsudo\fR:
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
bsdauth_type=string
Authentication type, if specified by the
\fB\-a\fR
option, to use on
systems where
BSD
authentication is supported.
.PD
.TP 6n
closefrom=number
If specified, the user has requested via the
\fB\-C\fR
option that
\fBsudo\fR
close all files descriptors with a value of
\fInumber\fR
or higher.
The plugin may optionally pass this, or another value, back in the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
cmnd_chroot=string
The root directory (see
chroot(2))
to run the command in, as specified by the user via the
\fB\-R\fR
option.
The plugin may ignore or restrict the user's ability to specify a new
root directory.
Only available starting with API version 1.16.
.TP 6n
cmnd_cwd=string
The working directory to run the command in, as specified by the user via the
\fB\-D\fR
option.
The plugin may ignore or restrict the user's ability to specify a new
working directory.
Only available starting with API version 1.16.
.TP 6n
debug_flags=string
A debug file path name followed by a space and a comma-separated
list of debug flags that correspond to the plugin's
\fIDebug\fR
entry in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@),
if there is one.
The flags are passed to the plugin exactly as they appear in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
The syntax used by
\fBsudo\fR
and the
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin is
\fIsubsystem\fR@\fIpriority\fR
but a plugin is free to use a different
format so long as it does not include a comma
(\(oq,\&\(cq).
Prior to
\fBsudo\fR
1.8.12, there was no way to specify plugin-specific
\fIdebug_flags\fR
so the value was always the same as that used by the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end and did not include a path name, only the flags themselves.
As of version 1.7 of the plugin interface,
\fBsudo\fR
will only pass
\fIdebug_flags\fR
if
sudo.conf(@mansectform@)
contains a plugin-specific
\fIDebug\fR
entry.
.TP 6n
ignore_ticket=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-k\fR
option along with a
command, indicating that the user wishes to ignore any cached
authentication credentials.
\fIimplied_shell\fR
to true.
This allows
\fBsudo\fR
with no arguments
to be used similarly to
su(1).
If the plugin does not to support this usage, it may return a value of \-2
from the
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function, which will cause
\fBsudo\fR
to print a usage message and exit.
.TP 6n
implied_shell=bool
If the user does not specify a program on the command line,
\fBsudo\fR
will pass the plugin the path to the user's shell and set
\fIimplied_shell\fR.
.TP 6n
intercept_ptrace=bool
Indicates whether or not the system supports intercept
mode using
ptrace(2).
This is currently only true for Linux systems that support
seccomp(2)
filtering and the
\(lqtrap\(rq
action.
Other systems will use a dynamic shared object to implement
intercept.
Only available starting with API version 1.19.
.TP 6n
intercept_setid=bool
Indicates whether or not the system supports running set-user-ID
and set-group-ID binaries in intercept mode.
This is currently only true for Linux systems that support
seccomp(2)
filtering and the
\(lqtrap\(rq
action.
On systems that use a dynamic shared object to implement
intercept, the dynamic linker (ld.so or the equivalent)
will disable preloading of shared objects when executing a
set-user-ID or set-group-ID binary.
This will disable intercept mode for that program and any other
programs that it executes.
The policy plugin may refuse to execute a set-user-ID or set-group-ID
binary in intercept mode to avoid this.
Only available starting with API version 1.19.
.TP 6n
login_class=string
BSD
login class to use when setting resource limits and nice value,
if specified by the
\fB\-c\fR
option.
.TP 6n
login_shell=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-i\fR
option, indicating that
the user wishes to run a login shell.
.TP 6n
max_groups=int
The maximum number of groups a user may belong to.
This will only be present if there is a corresponding setting in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
.TP 6n
network_addrs=list
A space-separated list of IP network addresses and netmasks in the
form
\(lqaddr/netmask\(rq,
e.g.,
\(lq192.168.1.2/255.255.255.0\(rq.
The address and netmask pairs may be either IPv4 or IPv6, depending on
what the operating system supports.
If the address contains a colon
(\(oq:\&\(cq),
it is an IPv6 address, else it is IPv4.
.TP 6n
noninteractive=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-n\fR
option, indicating that
\fBsudo\fR
should operate in non-interactive mode.
The plugin may reject a command run in non-interactive mode if user
interaction is required.
.TP 6n
plugin_dir=string
The default plugin directory used by the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end.
This is the default directory set at compile time and may not
correspond to the directory the running plugin was loaded from.
It may be used by a plugin to locate support files.
.TP 6n
plugin_path=string
The path name of plugin loaded by the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end.
The path name will be a fully-qualified unless the plugin was
statically compiled into
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
preserve_environment=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-E\fR
option, indicating that
the user wishes to preserve the environment.
.TP 6n
preserve_groups=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-P\fR
option, indicating that
the user wishes to preserve the group vector instead of setting it
based on the runas user.
.TP 6n
progname=string
The command name that sudo was run as, typically
\(lqsudo\(rq
or
\(lqsudoedit\(rq.
.TP 6n
prompt=string
The prompt to use when requesting a password, if specified via
the
\fB\-p\fR
option.
.TP 6n
remote_host=string
The name of the remote host to run the command on, if specified via
the
\fB\-h\fR
option.
Support for running the command on a remote host is meant to be implemented
via a helper program that is executed in place of the user-specified command.
The
\fBsudo\fR
front-end is only capable of executing commands on the local host.
Only available starting with API version 1.4.
.TP 6n
run_shell=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-s\fR
option, indicating that the user wishes to run a shell.
.TP 6n
runas_group=string
The group name or group-ID to run the command as, if specified via
the
\fB\-g\fR
option.
.TP 6n
runas_user=string
The user name or user-ID to run the command as, if specified via the
\fB\-u\fR
option.
.TP 6n
selinux_role=string
SELinux role to use when executing the command, if specified by
the
\fB\-r\fR
option.
.TP 6n
selinux_type=string
SELinux type to use when executing the command, if specified by
the
\fB\-t\fR
option.
.TP 6n
set_home=bool
Set to true if the user specified the
\fB\-H\fR
option.
If true, set the
\fRHOME\fR
environment variable to the target user's home directory.
.TP 6n
sudoedit=bool
Set to true when the
\fB\-e\fR
option is specified or if invoked as
\fBsudoedit\fR.
The plugin shall substitute an editor into
\fIargv\fR
in the
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function or return \-2 with a usage error
if the plugin does not support
\fIsudoedit\fR.
For more information, see the
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
section.
.TP 6n
timeout=string
Command timeout specified by the user via the
\fB\-T\fR
option.
Not all plugins support command timeouts and the ability of the
user to set a timeout may be restricted by policy.
The format of the timeout string is plugin-specific.
.TP 6n
update_ticket=bool
Set to false if the user specified the
\fB\-N\fR
option, indicating that the user wishes to avoid updating any cached
authentication credentials.
Only available starting with API version 1.20.
.PP
Additional settings may be added in the future so the plugin should
silently ignore settings that it does not recognize.
.RE
.TP 6n
\fIuser_info\fR
A vector of information about the user running the command in the form of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
The vector is terminated by a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.sp
When parsing
\fIuser_info\fR,
the plugin should split on the
\fBfirst\fR

The

function is called when
\fBsudo\fR
is finished, shortly before it exits.
Starting with API version 1.15,
\fBclose\fR()
is called regardless of whether or not a command was actually executed.
This makes it possible for plugins to perform cleanup even when a
command was not run.
It is not possible to tell whether a command was run based solely
on the arguments passed to the
\fBclose\fR()
function.
To determine if a command was actually run,
the plugin must keep track of whether or not the
\fBcheck_policy\fR()

.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIexit_status\fR
The command's exit status, as returned by the

\fIsudoedit\fR
is a mechanism for editing one or more files
where an editor is run with the user's credentials instead of with
elevated privileges.
\fBsudo\fR
achieves this by creating user-writable
temporary copies of the files to be edited and then overwriting the
originals with the temporary copies after editing is complete.
If the plugin supports
\fIsudoedit\fR,
it must set

list.
The plugin is responsible for choosing the editor to be used,
potentially from a variable in the user's environment, such as
\fREDITOR\fR,
and should be stored in
\fIargv_out\fR
(environment variables may include command line options).
The files to be edited should be copied from
\fIargv\fR
to
\fIargv_out\fR,
separated from the
editor and its arguments by a
\(oq--\(cq
element.
The
\(oq--\(cq
will be removed by
\fBsudo\fR
before the editor is executed.
The plugin may also set
\fIsudoedit_nfiles\fR
to the number of files to be edited in the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list; this will only be used by the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end starting with API version 1.21.
.sp
The
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function returns 1 if the command is allowed,
0 if not allowed, \-1 for a general error, or \-2 for a usage error
or if
\fIsudoedit\fR
was specified but is unsupported by the plugin.
In the latter case,
\fBsudo\fR
will print a usage message before it
exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
\fBconversation\fR()
or
\fBsudo_plugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIargc\fR
The number of elements in
\fIargv\fR,
not counting the final
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.TP 6n
\fIargv\fR
The argument vector describing the command the user wishes to run,
in the same form as what would be passed to the
execve(2)
system call.
The vector is terminated by a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
.TP 6n
\fIenv_add\fR
Additional environment variables specified by the user on the command
line in the form of a
\fRNULL\fR-terminated
vector of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
The plugin may reject the command if one or more variables
are not allowed to be set, or it may silently ignore such variables.
.sp
When parsing
\fIenv_add\fR,
the plugin should split on the
\fBfirst\fR
equal sign
(\(oq=\(cq)
since the
\fIname\fR
field will never include one itself but the
\fIvalue\fR
might.
.TP 6n
\fIcommand_info\fR
Information about the command being run in the form of
\(lqname=value\(rq
strings.
These values are used by
\fBsudo\fR
to set the execution environment when running a command.
The plugin is responsible for creating and populating the vector,
which must be terminated with a
\fRNULL\fR
pointer.
The following values are recognized by
\fBsudo\fR:
.PP
.RS 6n
.PD 0
.TP 6n
apparmor_profile=string
AppArmor profile to transition to when executing the command.
Only available starting with API version 1.19.
.PD
.TP 6n
chroot=string
The root directory to use when running the command.
.TP 6n
closefrom=number
If specified,
\fBsudo\fR
will close all files descriptors with a value
of
\fInumber\fR
or higher.
.TP 6n
command=string
Fully qualified path to the command to be executed.
.TP 6n
cwd=string
The current working directory to change to when executing the command.
If
\fBsudo\fR
is unable to change to the new working directory, the command will
not be run unless
\fIcwd_optional\fR
is also set (see below).
.TP 6n
cwd_optional=bool
If set,
\fBsudo\fR
will treat an inability to change to the new working directory as a
non-fatal error.
This setting has no effect unless
\fIcwd\fR
is also set.
.TP 6n
exec_background=bool
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
runs a command as the foreground process as long as
\fBsudo\fR
itself is running in the foreground.
When
\fIexec_background\fR
is enabled and the command is being run in a pseudo-terminal
(due to I/O logging or the
\fIuse_pty\fR
setting), the command will be run as a background process.
Attempts to read from the controlling terminal (or to change terminal
settings) will result in the command being suspended with the
\fRSIGTTIN\fR
signal (or
\fRSIGTTOU\fR
in the case of terminal settings).
If this happens when
\fBsudo\fR
is a foreground process, the command will be granted the controlling terminal
and resumed in the foreground with no user intervention required.
The advantage of initially running the command in the background is that
\fBsudo\fR
need not read from the terminal unless the command explicitly requests it.
Otherwise, any terminal input must be passed to the command, whether it
has required it or not (the kernel buffers terminals so it is not possible
to tell whether the command really wants the input).
This is different from historic
\fBsudo\fR
behavior or when the command is not being run in a pseudo-terminal.
.sp
For this to work seamlessly, the operating system must support the
automatic restarting of system calls.
Unfortunately, not all operating systems do this by default,
and even those that do may have bugs.
For example, macOS fails to restart the
\fBtcgetattr\fR()
and
\fBtcsetattr\fR()
system calls (this is a bug in macOS).
Furthermore, because this behavior depends on the command stopping with the
\fRSIGTTIN\fR
or
\fRSIGTTOU\fR
signals, programs that catch these signals and suspend themselves
with a different signal (usually
\fRSIGTOP\fR)
will not be automatically foregrounded.
Some versions of the linux
su(1)
command behave this way.
Because of this, a plugin should not set
\fIexec_background\fR
unless it is explicitly enabled by the administrator and there should
be a way to enabled or disable it on a per-command basis.
.sp
This setting has no effect unless I/O logging is enabled or
\fIuse_pty\fR
is enabled.
.TP 6n
execfd=number
If specified,
\fBsudo\fR
will use the
fexecve(2)
system call to execute the command instead of
execve(2).
The specified
\fInumber\fR
must refer to an open file descriptor.
.TP 6n
intercept=bool
If set,
\fBsudo\fR
will intercept attempts to execute a subsequent command and perform
a policy check via the policy plugin's
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function to determine whether or not the command is permitted.
This can be used to prevent shell escapes on supported platforms
but it has a number of limitations.
See
\fBPreventing shell escapes\fR
in
sudoers(@mansectform@)
for details.
Only available starting with API version 1.18.
.TP 6n
intercept_verify=bool
If set,
\fBsudo\fR
will attempt to verify that a command run in intercept mode has the
expected path name, command line arguments and environment.
This setting has no effect unless
\fIuse_ptrace\fR
is also enabled.
Only available starting with API version 1.20.
.TP 6n

When an I/O plugin is loaded,
\fBsudo\fR
runs the command in a pseudo-terminal.
This makes it possible to log the input and output from the user's
session.
If any of the standard input, standard output, or standard error do not
correspond to a tty,
\fBsudo\fR
will open a pipe to capture the I/O for logging before passing it on.
.PP
The
\fBlog_ttyin\fR()
function receives the raw user input from the terminal
device (this will include input even when echo is disabled,
such as when a password is read).
The
\fBlog_ttyout\fR()
function receives output from the pseudo-terminal that is
suitable for replaying the user's session at a later time.
The
\fBlog_stdin\fR(),
\fBlog_stdout\fR(),
and
\fBlog_stderr\fR()
functions are only called if the standard input, standard output,
or standard error respectively correspond to something other than
a tty.
.PP
Any of the logging functions may be set to the
\fRNULL\fR

If the open function returns 0, no I/O will be sent to the plugin.

If a logging function returns an error
(\-1),
the running command will be terminated and all of the plugin's logging
functions will be disabled.
Other I/O logging plugins will still receive any remaining
input or output that has not yet been processed.

If an input logging function rejects the data by returning 0, the
command will be terminated and the data will not be passed to the
command, though it will still be sent to any other I/O logging plugins.

The audit
\fBopen\fR()
function is run before any other
\fBsudo\fR
plugin API functions.
This makes it possible to audit failures in the other plugins.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
\fBsudo\fR
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
\fBconversation\fR()
or
\fBplugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIversion\fR
The version passed in by
\fBsudo\fR
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
\fIconversation\fR
A pointer to the

function that may be used by the
\fBshow_version\fR()
function to display version information (see
\fBshow_version\fR()
below).
The
\fBconversation\fR()
function may also be used to display additional error message to the user.
The
\fBconversation\fR()
function returns 0 on success, and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
\fIplugin_printf\fR
A pointer to a
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function that may be used by the
\fBshow_version\fR()
function to display version information (see
show_version below).
The
\fBplugin_printf\fR()
function may also be used to display additional error message to the user.
The

The approval
\fBopen\fR()
function is run immediately before a call to the plugin's
\fBcheck\fR()
or
\fBshow_version\fR()
functions.
It is only called if the version is being requested or if the
policy plugin's
\fBcheck_policy\fR()
function has returned successfully.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure, \-1 if a general error occurred,
or \-2 if there was a usage error.
In the latter case,
\fBsudo\fR
will print a usage message before it exits.
If an error occurs, the plugin may optionally call the
\fBconversation\fR()
or
\fBplugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIversion\fR
The version passed in by
\fBsudo\fR
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the plugin API supported by
\fBsudo\fR.
.TP 6n
\fIconversation\fR
A pointer to the
\fBconversation\fR()
function that can be used by the plugin to interact with the user (see
\fIConversation API\fR
for details).
Returns 0 on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
\fIplugin_printf\fR
A pointer to a
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function that may be used to display informational or error messages (see
\fIConversation API\fR

Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
\fIsettings\fR
A vector of user-supplied
\fBsudo\fR

These settings correspond to options the user specified when running
\fBsudo\fR.
As such, they will only be present when the corresponding option has
been specified on the command line.
.sp
When parsing
\fIsettings\fR,
the plugin should split on the

\fBsudoedit\fR
functionality must be handled by the policy plugin, not
\fBsudo\fR
itself as the front-end has no knowledge that a remote command is
being executed.
This may be addressed in a future revision of the plugin API.
.SS "Conversation API"
If the plugin needs to interact with the user, it may do so via the
\fBconversation\fR()
function.
A plugin should not attempt to read directly from the standard input
or the user's terminal (neither of which are guaranteed to exist).
The caller must include a trailing newline in
\fImsg\fR
if one is to be printed.
.PP
A
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function is also available that can be used to display informational
or error messages to the user, which is usually more convenient for
simple messages where no use input is required.
.PP
\fIConversation function structures\fR
.PP
The conversation function takes as arguments pointers to the following
structures:
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
struct sudo_conv_message {
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF  0x0001 /* do not echo user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_ON   0x0002 /* echo user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG        0x0003 /* error message */
#define SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG         0x0004 /* informational message */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK      0x0005 /* mask user input */
#define SUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OK   0x1000 /* flag: allow echo if no tty */
#define SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY       0x2000 /* flag: use tty if possible */
    int msg_type;
    int timeout;
    const char *msg;
};

#define SUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX      1023

struct sudo_conv_reply {
    char *reply;
};

typedef int (*sudo_conv_callback_fn_t)(int signo, void *closure);
struct sudo_conv_callback {
    unsigned int version;
    void *closure;
    sudo_conv_callback_fn_t on_suspend;
    sudo_conv_callback_fn_t on_resume;
};
.RE
.fi
.PP
Pointers to the
\fBconversation\fR()
and
\fBprintf\fR()-style
functions are passed
in to the plugin's
\fBopen\fR()
function when the plugin is initialized.
The following type definitions can be used in the declaration of the
\fBopen\fR()
function:
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
typedef int (*sudo_conv_t)(int num_msgs,
    const struct sudo_conv_message msgs[],
    struct sudo_conv_reply replies[], struct sudo_conv_callback *callback);

typedef int (*sudo_printf_t)(int msg_type, const char * restrict fmt, ...);
.RE
.fi
.PP
To use the
\fBconversation\fR()
function, the plugin must pass an array of
\fIstruct sudo_conv_message\fR
and
\fIstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR.
There must be a
\fIstruct sudo_conv_message\fR
and
\fIstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR
for each message in the conversation, that is, both arrays must
have the same number of elements.
Each
\fIstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR
must have its
\fIreply\fR
member initialized to
\fRNULL\fR.
The
\fIstruct sudo_conv_callback\fR
pointer, if not
\fRNULL\fR,
should contain function pointers to be called when the
\fBsudo\fR
process is suspended and/or resumed during conversation input.
The
\fIon_suspend\fR
and
\fIon_resume\fR
functions are called with the signal that caused
\fBsudo\fR
to be suspended and the
\fIclosure\fR
pointer from the
\fIstruct sudo_conv_callback\fR.
These functions should return 0 on success and \-1 on error.
On error, the conversation will end and the conversation function
will return a value of \-1.
The intended use is to allow the plugin to release resources, such as locks,
that should not be held indefinitely while suspended and then reacquire them
when the process is resumed.
The functions are not actually invoked from within a signal handler.
.PP
The
\fImsg_type\fR
must be set to one of the following values:
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF\fR
Prompt the user for input with echo disabled;
this is generally used for passwords.
The reply will be stored in the
\fIreplies\fR
array, and it will never be
\fRNULL\fR.
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_ON\fR
Prompt the user for input with echo enabled.
The reply will be stored in the
\fIreplies\fR
array, and it will never be
\fRNULL\fR.
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
Display an error message.
The message is written to the standard error unless the
\fRSUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY\fR
flag is set, in which case it is written to the user's terminal if possible.
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR
Display a message.
The message is written to the standard output unless the
\fRSUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY\fR
flag is set, in which case it is written to the user's terminal if possible.
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK\fR
Prompt the user for input but echo an asterisk character for each
character read.
The reply will be stored in the
\fIreplies\fR
array, and it will never be
\fRNULL\fR.
This can be used to provide visual feedback to the user while reading
sensitive information that should not be displayed.
.PP
In addition to the above values, the following flag bits may also be set:
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OK\fR
Allow input to be read when echo cannot be disabled
when the message type is
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_ECHO_OFF\fR
or
\fRSUDO_CONV_PROMPT_MASK\fR.
By default,
\fBsudo\fR
will refuse to read input if the echo cannot be disabled for those
message types.
.TP 6n
\fRSUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY\fR
When displaying a message via
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
or
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR,
try to write the message to the user's terminal.
If the terminal is unavailable, the standard error or standard output
will be used, depending upon whether
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
or
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR
was used.
The user's terminal is always used when possible for input,
this flag is only used for output.
.PP
The
\fItimeout\fR
in seconds until the prompt will wait for no more input.
A zero value implies an infinite timeout.
.PP
The plugin is responsible for freeing the reply buffer located in each
\fIstruct sudo_conv_reply\fR,
if it is not
\fRNULL\fR.
\fRSUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX\fR
represents the maximum length of the reply buffer (not including
the trailing NUL character).
In practical terms, this is the longest password
\fBsudo\fR
will support.
.PP
The
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function uses the same underlying mechanism as the
\fBconversation\fR()
function but only supports
\fRSUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG\fR
and
\fRSUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG\fR
for the
\fImsg_type\fR
parameter.
It can be more convenient than using the
\fBconversation\fR()
function if no user reply is needed and supports standard
\fBprintf\fR()
escape sequences.
.PP
See the sample plugin for an example of the
\fBconversation\fR()
function usage.
.SS "Plugin invocation order"
As of
\fBsudo\fR
1.9.0, the plugin
\fBopen\fR()
and
\fBclose\fR()
functions are called in the
following order:
.TP 5n
1.\&
audit open
.TP 5n
2.\&
policy open
.TP 5n
3.\&
approval open
.TP 5n
4.\&
approval close
.TP 5n
5.\&
I/O log open
.TP 5n

I/O log close
.TP 5n
9.\&
policy close
.TP 5n
10.\&
audit close
.TP 5n
11.\&
sudo exits
.PP
Prior to
\fBsudo\fR
1.9.0, the I/O log
\fBclose\fR()
function was called
\fIafter\fR
the policy
\fBclose\fR()
function.
.SS "Sudoers group plugin API"
The
\fBsudoers\fR
plugin supports its own plugin interface to allow non-Unix
group lookups.
This can be used to query a group source other than the standard Unix
group database.
Two sample group plugins are bundled with
\fBsudo\fR,
\fIgroup_file\fR,
and
\fIsystem_group\fR,
are detailed in
sudoers(@mansectform@).
Third party group plugins include a QAS AD plugin available from Quest Software.
.PP
A group plugin must declare and populate a
\fIstruct sudoers_group_plugin\fR
in the global scope.
This structure contains pointers to the functions that implement plugin
initialization, cleanup, and group lookup.
.nf
.sp
.RS 0n
struct sudoers_group_plugin {
    unsigned int version;
    int (*init)(int version, sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf,
        char *const argv[]);
    void (*cleanup)(void);
    int (*query)(const char *user, const char *group,
        const struct passwd *pwd);
};
.RE
.fi
.PP
A
\fIstruct sudoers_group_plugin\fR
has the following fields:
.TP 6n
\fIversion\fR
The
\fIversion\fR
field should be set to GROUP_API_VERSION.
.sp
This allows
\fBsudoers\fR
to determine the API version the group plugin
was built against.
.TP 6n
\fIinit\fR
.nf
.RS 6n
int (*init)(int version, sudo_printf_t sudo_plugin_printf,
    char *const argv[]);
.RE
.fi
.RS 6n
.sp
The
\fBinit\fR()
function is called after
\fIsudoers\fR
has been parsed but
before any policy checks.
It returns 1 on success, 0 on failure (or if the plugin is not configured),
and \-1 if a error occurred.
If an error occurs, the plugin may call the
\fBplugin_printf\fR()
function with
\fRSUDO_CONF_ERROR_MSG\fR
to present additional error information to the user.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIversion\fR
The version passed in by
\fBsudoers\fR
allows the plugin to determine the
major and minor version number of the group plugin API supported by
\fBsudoers\fR.
.TP 6n
\fIplugin_printf\fR
A pointer to a
\fBprintf\fR()-style
function that may be used to display informational or error message to the user.
Returns the number of characters printed on success and \-1 on failure.
.TP 6n
\fIargv\fR
A
\fRNULL\fR-terminated
array of arguments generated from the
\fIgroup_plugin\fR
option in
\fIsudoers\fR.
If no arguments were given,
\fIargv\fR
will be
\fRNULL\fR.

function is used to ask the group plugin whether
\fIuser\fR
is a member of
\fIgroup\fR.
.sp
The function arguments are as follows:
.TP 6n
\fIuser\fR
The name of the user being looked up in the external group database.
.TP 6n
\fIgroup\fR
.br
The name of the group being queried.
.TP 6n
\fIpwd\fR
The password database entry for

.SH "PLUGIN API CHANGELOG"
The following revisions have been made to the Sudo Plugin API.
.TP 6n
Version 1.0
Initial API version.
.TP 6n
Version 1.1 (sudo 1.8.0)
The I/O logging plugin's
\fBopen\fR()
function was modified to take the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list as an argument.
.TP 6n
Version 1.2 (sudo 1.8.5)
The Policy and I/O logging plugins'
\fBopen\fR()
functions are now passed
a list of plugin parameters if any are specified in
sudo.conf(@mansectform@).
.sp
A simple hooks API has been introduced to allow plugins to hook in to the
system's environment handling functions.
.sp
The
\fBinit_session\fR()
Policy plugin function is now passed a pointer
to the user environment which can be updated as needed.
This can be used to merge in environment variables stored in the PAM
handle before a command is run.
.TP 6n
Version 1.3 (sudo 1.8.7)
Support for the
\fIexec_background\fR
entry has been added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fImax_groups\fR
and
\fIplugin_dir\fR
entries were added to the
\fIsettings\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fBversion\fR()
and
\fBclose\fR()
functions are now optional.
Previously, a missing
\fBversion\fR()
or
\fBclose\fR()
function would result in a crash.
If no policy plugin
\fBclose\fR()
function is defined, a default
\fBclose\fR()
function will be provided by the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end that displays a warning if the command could not be
executed.
.sp
The
\fBsudo\fR
front-end now installs default signal handlers to trap common signals
while the plugin functions are run.
.TP 6n
Version 1.4 (sudo 1.8.8)
The
\fIremote_host\fR
entry was added to the
\fIsettings\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.5 (sudo 1.8.9)
The
\fIpreserve_fds\fR
entry was added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.6 (sudo 1.8.11)
The behavior when an I/O logging plugin returns an error
(\-1)
has changed.
Previously, the
\fBsudo\fR
front-end took no action when the
\fBlog_ttyin\fR(),
\fBlog_ttyout\fR(),
\fBlog_stdin\fR(),
\fBlog_stdout\fR(),
or
\fBlog_stderr\fR()
function returned an error.
.sp
The behavior when an I/O logging plugin returns 0 has changed.
Previously, output from the command would be displayed to the
terminal even if an output logging function returned 0.
.TP 6n
Version 1.7 (sudo 1.8.12)
The
\fIplugin_path\fR
entry was added to the
\fIsettings\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fIdebug_flags\fR
entry now starts with a debug file path name and may occur multiple
times if there are multiple plugin-specific Debug lines in the
sudo.conf(@mansectform@) file.
.TP 6n
Version 1.8 (sudo 1.8.15)
The
\fIsudoedit_checkdir\fR
and
\fIsudoedit_follow\fR
entries were added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
The default value of
\fIsudoedit_checkdir\fR
was changed to true in sudo 1.8.16.
.sp
The sudo
\fBconversation\fR()
function now takes a pointer to a
\fIstruct sudo_conv_callback\fR
as its fourth argument.
The
\fIsudo_conv_t\fR
definition has been updated to match.
The plugin must specify that it supports plugin API version 1.8 or higher
to receive a conversation function pointer that supports this argument.
.TP 6n
Version 1.9 (sudo 1.8.16)
The
\fIexecfd\fR
entry was added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.10 (sudo 1.8.19)
The
\fIumask\fR
entry was added to the
\fIuser_info\fR
list.
The
\fIiolog_group\fR,
\fIiolog_mode\fR,
and
\fIiolog_user\fR
entries were added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.11 (sudo 1.8.20)
The
\fItimeout\fR
entry was added to the
\fIsettings\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.12 (sudo 1.8.21)
The
\fBchange_winsize\fR()
function was added to
\fIstruct io_plugin\fR.
.TP 6n
Version 1.13 (sudo 1.8.26)
The
\fBlog_suspend\fR()
function was added to
\fIstruct io_plugin\fR.
.TP 6n
Version 1.14 (sudo 1.8.29)
The
\fIumask_override\fR
entry was added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.15 (sudo 1.9.0)
The
\fIcwd_optional\fR
entry was added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.sp
The
\fBevent_alloc\fR()
function was added to
\fIstruct policy_plugin\fR
and
\fIstruct io_plugin\fR.
.sp
The
\fIerrstr\fR
argument was added to the policy and I/O plugin functions
which the plugin function can use to return an error string.
This string may be used by the audit plugin to report failure or
error conditions set by the other plugins.
.sp
The
\fBclose\fR()
function is now is called regardless of whether or not a command
was actually executed.
This makes it possible for plugins to perform cleanup even when a
command was not run.
.sp
\fRSUDO_CONV_REPL_MAX\fR
has increased from 255 to 1023 bytes.
.sp
Support for audit and approval plugins was added.

entries were added to the
\fIcommand_info\fR
list.
.TP 6n
Version 1.20 (sudo 1.9.12)
The
\fIupdate_ticket\fR
entry was added to the
\fIsettings\fR
list.
The
\fIintercept_verify\fR
entry was added to the
