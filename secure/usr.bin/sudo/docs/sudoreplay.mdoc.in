.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
plays back or lists the output logs created by
.Nm sudo .
When replaying,
.Nm
can play the session back in real-time, or the playback speed may be
adjusted (faster or slower) based on the command line options.
.Pp
The
.Em ID
should either be a six character sequence of digits and
upper case letters, e.g.,
.Dq 0100A5
or a path name.
The
.Em ID
may include an optional
.Ar @offset
suffix which may be used to start replaying at a specific time offset.
The
.Ar @offset
is specified as a number in seconds since the start of the session
with an optional decimal fraction.
.Pp
Path names may be relative to the I/O log directory
.Pa @iolog_dir@
(unless overridden by the
.Fl d
option) or fully qualified, beginning with a
.Ql /
character.
When a command is run via
.Nm sudo
with
.Em log_output
enabled in the
.Em sudoers
file, a
.Dq TSID=ID
string is logged via
.Xr syslog 3
or to the
.Nm sudo
log file.
The
.Em ID
may also be determined using
.Nm sudoreplay Ns 's
list mode.
.Pp
In list mode,
.Nm
can be used to find the ID of a session based on a number of criteria
such as the user, tty, or command run.
.Pp
In replay mode, if the standard input and output are connected to a terminal
and the
.Fl n
option is not specified,
.Nm
will operate interactively.
In interactive mode,
.Nm
will attempt to adjust the terminal size to match that of the session and
write directly to the terminal (not all terminals support this).
Additionally, it will poll the keyboard and act on the following keys:
.Bl -tag -width 12n
.It So Li \en Sc No or So Li \er Sc
Skip to the next replay event; useful for long pauses.
.It So Li \  Sc Pq space
Pause output; press any key to resume.
.It Ql <
Reduce the playback speed by one half.
.It Ql >
Double the playback speed.
.El
.Pp
The session can be interrupted via control-C.
When the session has finished, the terminal is restored to its
original size if it was changed during playback.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar dir , Fl -directory Ns = Ns Ar dir
Store session logs in
.Ar dir
instead of the default,
.Pa @iolog_dir@ .
.It Fl f Ar filter , Fl -filter Ns = Ns Ar filter
Select which I/O type(s) to display.
By default,
.Nm
will display the command's standard output, standard error, and tty output.
The
.Ar filter
argument is a comma-separated list, consisting of one or more of following:
.Em stdin ,
.Em stdout ,
.Em stderr ,
.Em ttyin ,
and
.Em ttyout .
.It Fl F , -follow
Enable
.Dq follow mode .
When replaying a session,
.Nm
will ignore end-of-file and keep replaying until the log is complete.
This can be used to replay a session that is still in progress,
similar to
.Dq tail -f .
An I/O log file is considered to be complete when the write bits
have been cleared on the session's timing file.
Versions of
.Nm sudo
prior to 1.9.1 do not clear the write bits upon completion.
.It Fl h , -help
Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.
.It Fl l , -list Op Ar search expression
Enable
.Dq list mode .
In this mode,
.Nm
will list available sessions in a format similar to the
.Nm sudo
log file format, sorted by file name (or sequence number).
Any control characters present in the log data are formatted in octal
with a leading
.Ql #
character.
For example, a horizontal tab is displayed as
.Ql #011
and an embedded carriage return is displayed as
.Ql #015 .
Space characters in the command name and arguments are also formatted in octal.
.Pp
If a
.Ar search expression
is specified, it will be used to restrict the IDs that are displayed.
An expression is composed of the following predicates:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It command Ar pattern
Evaluates to true if the command run matches the POSIX extended
regular expression
.Ar pattern .
.It cwd Ar directory
Evaluates to true if the command was run with the specified current
working directory.
.It fromdate Ar date
Evaluates to true if the command was run on or after
.Ar date .
See
.Sx Date and time format
for a description of supported date and time formats.
.It group Ar runas_group
Evaluates to true if the command was run with the specified
.Ar runas_group .
Unless a
.Ar runas_group
was explicitly specified when
.Nm sudo
was run this field will be empty in the log.
.It host Ar hostname
Evaluates to true if the command was run on the specified
.Ar hostname .
.It runas Ar runas_user
Evaluates to true if the command was run as the specified
.Ar runas_user .
By default,
.Nm sudo
runs commands as the
.Sy root
user.
.It todate Ar date
Evaluates to true if the command was run on or prior to
.Ar date .
See
.Sx Date and time format
for a description of supported date and time formats.
.It tty Ar tty name
Evaluates to true if the command was run on the specified terminal device.
The
.Ar tty name
should be specified without the
.Pa /dev/
prefix, e.g.,
.Pa tty01
instead of
.Pa /dev/tty01 .
.It user Ar user name
Evaluates to true if the ID matches a command run by
.Ar user name .
.El
.Pp
Predicates may be abbreviated to the shortest unique string.
.Pp
Predicates may be combined using
.Em and ,
.Em or ,
and
.Em \&!
operators as well as
.Ql \&(
and
.Ql \&)
grouping (parentheses must generally be escaped from the shell).
The
.Em and
operator is optional, adjacent predicates have an implied
.Em and
unless separated by an
.Em or .
.It Fl m , -max-wait Ar max_wait
Specify an upper bound on how long to wait between key presses or output data.
By default,
.Nm
will accurately reproduce the delays between key presses or program output.
However, this can be tedious when the session includes long pauses.
When the
.Fl m
option is specified,
.Nm
will limit these pauses to at most
.Em max_wait
seconds.
The value may be specified as a floating point number, e.g.,
.Em 2.5 .
A
.Em max_wait
of zero or less will eliminate the pauses entirely.
.It Fl n , -non-interactive
Do not prompt for user input or attempt to re-size the terminal.
The session is written to the standard output, not directly to
the user's terminal.
.It Fl R , -no-resize
Do not attempt to re-size the terminal to match the terminal size
of the session.
.It Fl S , -suspend-wait
Wait while the command was suspended.
By default,
.Nm
will ignore the time interval between when the command was suspended
and when it was resumed.
If the
.Fl S
option is specified,
.Nm
will wait instead.
.It Fl s , -speed Ar speed_factor
This option causes
.Nm
to adjust the number of seconds it will wait between key presses or
program output.
This can be used to slow down or speed up the display.
For example, a
.Ar speed_factor
of
.Em 2
would make the output twice as fast whereas a
.Ar speed_factor
of
.Em .5
would make the output twice as slow.
.It Fl V , -version
Print the
.Nm
versions version number and exit.
.El
.Ss Date and time format
The time and date may be specified multiple ways, common formats include:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It HH:MM:SS am MM/DD/CCYY timezone
24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm.
.It HH:MM:SS am Month, Day Year timezone
24 hour time may be used in place of am/pm, and month and day names
may be abbreviated.
Month and day of the week names must be specified in English.
.It CCYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
ISO time format
.It DD Month CCYY HH:MM:SS
The month name may be abbreviated.
.El
.Pp
Either time or date may be omitted, the am/pm and timezone are optional.
If no date is specified, the current day is assumed; if no time is
specified, the first second of the specified date is used.
The less significant parts of both time and date may also be omitted,
in which case zero is assumed.
.Pp
The following are all valid time and date specifications:
.Bl -tag -width 6n
.It now
The current time and date.
.It tomorrow
Exactly one day from now.
.It yesterday
24 hours ago.
.It 2 hours ago
2 hours ago.
.It next Friday
The first second of the Friday in the next (upcoming) week.
Not to be confused with
.Dq this Friday
which would match the Friday of the current week.
.It last week
The current time but 7 days ago.
This is equivalent to
.Dq a week ago .
.It a fortnight ago
The current time but 14 days ago.
.It 10:01 am 9/17/2009
10:01 am, September 17, 2009.
.It 10:01 am
10:01 am on the current day.
.It 10
10:00 am on the current day.
.It 9/17/2009
00:00 am, September 17, 2009.
.It 10:01 am Sep 17, 2009
10:01 am, September 17, 2009.
.El
.Pp
Relative time specifications do not always work as expected.
For example, the
.Dq next
qualifier is intended to be used in conjunction with a day such as
.Dq next Monday .
When used with units of weeks, months, years, etc
the result will be one more than expected.
For example,
.Dq next week
will result in a time exactly two weeks from now, which is probably
not what was intended.
This will be addressed in a future version of
.Nm .
.Ss Debugging sudoreplay
