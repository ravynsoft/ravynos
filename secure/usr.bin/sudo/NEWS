What's new in Sudo 1.9.15p5

 * Fixed evaluation of the "lecture", "listpw", "verifypw", and
   "fdexec" sudoers Defaults settings when used without an explicit
   value.  Previously, if specified without a value they were
   evaluated as boolean "false", even when the negation operator
   ('!') was not present.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.14 that prevented LDAP
   netgroup queries using the NETGROUP_BASE setting from being
   performed.

 * Sudo will now transparently rename a user's lecture file from
   the older name-based path to the newer user-ID-based path.
   GitHub issue #342.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.15 that could cause a memory
   allocation failure if sysconf(_SC_LOGIN_NAME_MAX) fails.  Bug #1066.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.15p4

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.15 that could prevent a user's
   privileges from being listed by "sudo -l" if the sudoers entry
   in /etc/nsswitch.conf contains "[SUCCESS=return]".  This did not
   affect the ability to run commands via sudo.  Bug #1063.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.15p3

 * Always disable core dumps when sudo sends itself a fatal signal.
   Fixes a problem where sudo could potentially dump core dump when
   it re-sends the fatal signal to itself.  This is only an issue
   if the command received a signal that would normally result in
   a core dump but the command did not actually dump core.

 * Fixed a bug matching a command with a relative path name when
   the sudoers rule uses shell globbing rules for the path name.
   Bug #1062.

 * Permit visudo to be run even if the local host name is not set.
   GitHub issue #332.

 * Fixed an editing error introduced in sudo 1.9.15 that could
   prevent sudoreplay from replaying sessions correctly.
   GitHub issue #334.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.15 where "sudo -l > /dev/null"
   could hang on Linux systems.  GitHub issue #335.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.15 where Solaris privileges
   specified in sudoers were not applied to the command being run.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.15p2

 * Fixed a bug on BSD systems where sudo would not restore the
   terminal settings on exit if the terminal had parity enabled.
   GitHub issue #326.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.15p1

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.15 that prevented LDAP-based
   sudoers from being able to read the ldap.conf file.
   GitHub issue #325.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.15

 * Fixed an undefined symbol problem on older versions of macOS
   when "intercept" or "log_subcmds" are enabled in sudoers.
   GitHub issue #276.

 * Fixed "make check" failure related to getpwent(3) wrapping
   on NetBSD.

 * Fixed the warning message for "sudo -l command" when the command
   is not permitted.  There was a missing space between "list" and
   the actual command due to changes in sudo 1.9.14.

 * Fixed a bug where output could go to the wrong terminal if
   "use_pty" is enabled (the default) and the standard input, output
   or error is redirected to a different terminal.  Bug #1056.

 * The visudo utility will no longer create an empty file when the
   specified sudoers file does not exist and the user exits the
   editor without making any changes.  GitHub issue #294.

 * The AIX and Solaris sudo packages on www.sudo.ws now support
   "log_subcmds" and "intercept" with both 32-bit and 64-bit
   binaries.  Previously, they only worked when running binaries
   with the same word size as the sudo binary.  GitHub issue #289.

 * The sudoers source is now logged in the JSON event log.  This
   makes it possible to tell which rule resulted in a match.

 * Running "sudo -ll command" now produces verbose output that
   includes matching rule as well as the path to the sudoers file
   the matching rule came from.  For LDAP sudoers, the name of the
   matching sudoRole is printed instead.

 * The embedded copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.3.

 * The sudoers plugin has been modified to make it more resilient
   to ROWHAMMER attacks on authentication and policy matching.
   This addresses CVE-2023-42465.

 * The sudoers plugin now constructs the user time stamp file path
   name using the user-ID instead of the user name.  This avoids a
   potential problem with user names that contain a path separator
   ('/') being interpreted as part of the path name.  A similar
   issue in sudo-rs has been assigned CVE-2023-42456.

 * A path separator ('/') in a user, group or host name is now
   replaced with an underbar character ('_') when expanding escapes
   in @include and @includedir directives as well as the "iolog_file"
   and "iolog_dir" sudoers Default settings.

 * The "intercept_verify" sudoers option is now only applied when
   the "intercept" option is set in sudoers.  Previously, it was
   also applied when "log_subcmds" was enabled.  Sudo 1.9.14
   contained an incorrect fix for this.  Bug #1058.

 * Changes to terminal settings are now performed atomically, where
   possible.  If the command is being run in a pseudo-terminal and
   the user's terminal is already in raw mode, sudo will not change
   the user's terminal settings.  This prevents concurrent sudo
   processes from restoring the terminal settings to the wrong values.
   GitHub issue #312.

 * Reverted a change from sudo 1.9.4 that resulted in PAM session
   modules being called with the environment of the command to be
   run instead of the environment of the invoking user.
   GitHub issue #318.

 * New Indonesian translation from translationproject.org.

 * The sudo_logsrvd server will now raise its open file descriptor
   limit to the maximum allowed value when it starts up.  Each
   connection can require up to nine open file descriptors so the
   default soft limit may be too low.

 * Better log message when rejecting a command if the "intercept"
   option is enabled and the "intercept_allow_setid" option is
   disabled.  Previously, "command not allowed" would be logged and
   the user had no way of knowing what the actual problem was.

 * Sudo will now log the invoking user's environment as "submitenv"
   in the JSON logs.  The command's environment ("runenv") is no
   longer logged for commands rejected by the sudoers file or an
   approval plugin.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.14p3

 * Fixed a crash with Python 3.12 when the sudo Python plugin is
   unloaded.  This only affects "make check" for the Python plugin.

 * Adapted the sudo Python plugin test output to match Python 3.12.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.14p2

 * Fixed a crash on Linux systems introduced in version 1.9.14 when
   running a command with a NULL argv[0] if "log_subcmds" or
   "intercept" is enabled in sudoers.

 * Fixed a problem with "stair-stepped" output when piping or
   redirecting the output of a sudo command that takes user input.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.14 that affects matching
   sudoers rules containing a Runas_Spec with an empty Runas user.
   These rules should only match when sudo's -g option is used but
   were matching even without the -g option.  GitHub issue #290.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.14p1

 * Fixed an invalid free bug in sudo_logsrvd that was introduced
   in version 1.9.14 which could cause sudo_logsrvd to crash.

 * The sudoers plugin no longer tries to send the terminal name
   to the log server when no terminal is present.  This bug was
   introduced in version 1.9.14.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.14

 * Fixed a bug where if the "intercept" or "log_subcmds" sudoers
   option was enabled and a sub-command was run where the first
   entry of the argument vector didn't match the command being run.
   This resulted in commands like "sudo su -" being killed due to
   the mismatch.  Bug #1050.

 * The sudoers plugin now canonicalizes command path names before
   matching (where possible).  This fixes a bug where sudo could
   execute the wrong path if there are multiple symbolic links with
   the same target and the same base name in sudoers that a user is
   allowed to run.  GitHub issue #228.

 * Improved command matching when a chroot is specified in sudoers.
   The sudoers plugin will now change the root directory id needed
   before performing command matching.  Previously, the root directory
   was simply prepended to the path that was being processed.
 
 * When NETGROUP_BASE is set in the ldap.conf file, sudo will now
   perform its own netgroup lookups of the host name instead of
   using the system innetgr(3) function.  This guarantees that user
   and host netgroup lookups are performed using  the same LDAP
   server (or servers).

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.13 that resulted in a missing
   " ; " separator between environment variables and the command
   in log entries.
   
 * The visudo utility now displays a warning when it ignores a file
   in an include dir such as /etc/sudoers.d.

 * When running a command in a pseudo-terminal, sudo will initialize
   the terminal settings even if it is the background process.
   Previously, sudo only initialized the pseudo-terminal when running
   in the foreground.  This fixes an issue where a program that
   checks the window size would read the wrong value when sudo was
   running in the background.

 * Fixed a bug where only the first two digits of the TSID field
   being was logged.  Bug #1046.

 * The "use_pty" sudoers option is now enabled by default.  To
   restore the historic behavior where a command is run in the
   user's terminal, add "Defaults !use_pty" to the sudoers file.
   GitHub issue #258.

 * Sudo's "-b" option now works when the command is run in a
   pseudo-terminal.

 * When disabling core dumps, sudo now only modifies the soft limit
   and leaves the hard limit as-is.  This avoids problems on Linux
   when sudo does not have CAP_SYS_RESOURCE, which may be the case
   when run inside a container.  GitHub issue #42.

 * Sudo configuration file paths have been converted to colon-separated
   lists of paths.  This makes it possible to have configuration
   files on a read-only file system while still allowing for local
   modifications in a different (writable) directory.  The new
   --enable-adminconf configure option can be used to specify a
   directory that is searched for configuration files in preference
   to the sysconfdir (which is usually /etc).

 * The NETGROUP_QUERY ldap.conf parameter can now be disabled for
   LDAP servers that do not support querying the nisNetgroup object
   by its nisNetgroupTriple attribute, while still allowing sudo to
   query the LDAP server directly to determine netgroup membership.

 * Fixed a long-standing bug where a sudoers rule without an explicit
   runas list allowed the user to run a command as root and any
   group instead of just one of the groups that root is a member
   of.  For example, a rule such as "myuser ALL = ALL" would permit
   "sudo -u root -g othergroup" even if root did not belong to
   "othergroup".

 * Fixed a bug where a sudoers rule with an explicit runas list
   allowed a user to run sudo commands as themselves.  For example,
   a rule such as "myuser ALL = (root) ALL", "myuser" should only
   allow commands to be run as root (optionally using one of root's
   groups).  However, the rule also allowed the user to run
   "sudo -u myuser -g myuser command".

 * Fixed a bug that prevented the user from specifying a group on
   the command line via "sudo -g" if the rule's Runas_Spec contained
   a Runas_Alias.

 * Sudo now requires a C compiler that conforms to ISO C99 or higher
   to build.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.13p3

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.13 that caused a syntax error
   when "list" was used as a user or host name.  GitHub issue #246.

 * Fixed a bug that could cause sudo to hang when running a command
   in a pseudo-terminal when there is still input buffered after a
   command has exited.

 * Fixed "sudo -U otheruser -l command".  This is a regression in
   sudo 1.9.13.  GitHub issue #248.

 * Fixed "sudo -l command args" when matching a command in sudoers
   with command line arguments.  This is a regression in sudo 1.9.13.
   GitHub issue #249.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.13p2

 * Fixed the --enable-static-sudoers option, broken in sudo 1.9.13.
   GitHub issue #245.

 * Fixed a potential double-free bug when matching a sudoers rule
   that contains a per-command chroot directive (CHROOT=dir).  This
   bug was introduced in sudo 1.9.8.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.13p1

 * Fixed a typo in the configure script that resulted in a line
   like "]: command not found" in the output.  GitHub issue #238.

 * Corrected the order of the C23 [[noreturn]] attribute in function
   prototypes.  This fixes a build error with GCC 13.  GitHub issue
   #239.

 * The "check" make target misbehaved when there was more than
   one version of the UTF-8 C locale in the output of "locale -a".
   GitHub issue #241.

 * Removed a dependency on the AC_SYS_YEAR2038 macro in configure.ac.
   This was added in autoconf 2.72 but sudo's configure.ac only
   required autoconf 2.70.

 * Relaxed the autoconf version requirement to version 2.69.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.13

 * Fixed a bug running relative commands via sudo when "log_subcmds"
   is enabled.  GitHub issue #194.

 * Fixed a signal handling bug when running sudo commands in a shell
   script.  Signals were not being forwarded to the command when
   the sudo process was not run in its own process group.

 * Fixed a bug in cvtsudoers' LDIF parsing when the file ends without
   a newline and a backslash is the last character of the file.

 * Fixed a potential use-after-free bug with cvtsudoers filtering.
   GitHub issue #198.

 * Added a reminder to the default lecture that the password will
   not echo. This line is only displayed when the pwfeedback option
   is disabled. GitHub issue #195.

 * Fixed potential memory leaks in error paths.  GitHub issues #199,
   #202.

 * Fixed potential NULL dereferences on memory allocation failure.
   GitHub issues #204, #211.

 * Sudo now uses C23-style attributes in function prototypes instead
   of gcc-style attributes if supported.

 * Added a new "list" pseudo-command in sudoers to allow a user to
   list another user's privileges.  Previously, only root or a user
   with the ability to run any command as either root or the target
   user on the current host could use the -U option.  This also
   includes a fix to the log entry when a user lacks permission to
   run "sudo -U otheruser -l command".  Previously, the logs would
   indicate that the user tried to run the actual command, now the
   log entry includes the list operation.

 * JSON logging now escapes control characters if they happen to
   appear in the command or environment.

 * New Albanian translation from translationproject.org.

 * Regular expressions in sudoers or logsrvd.conf may no longer
   contain consecutive repetition operators.  This is implementation-
   specific behavior according to POSIX, but some implementations
   will allocate excessive amounts of memory.  This mainly affects
   the fuzzers.

 * Sudo now builds AIX-style shared libraries and dynamic shared
   objects by default instead of svr4-style. This means that the
   default sudo plugins are now .a (archive) files that contain a
   .so shared object file instead of bare .so files.  This was done
   to improve compatibility with the AIX Freeware ecosystem,
   specifically, the AIX Freeware build of OpenSSL.  Sudo will still
   load svr4-style .so plugins and if a .so file is requested,
   either via sudo.conf or the sudoers file, and only the .a file
   is present, sudo will convert the path from plugin.so to
   plugin.a(plugin.so) when loading it.  This ensures compatibility
   with existing configurations.  To restore the old, pre-1.9.13
   behavior, run configure using the --with-aix-soname=svr4 option.

 * Sudo no longer checks the ownership and mode of the plugins that
   it loads.  Plugins are configured via either the sudo.conf or
   sudoers file which are trusted configuration files.  These checks
   suffered from time-of-check vs. time-of-use race conditions and
   complicate loading plugins that are not simple paths.  Ownership
   and mode checks are still performed when loading the sudo.conf
   and sudoers files, which do not suffer from race conditions.
   The sudo.conf "developer_mode" setting is no longer used.

 * Control characters in sudo log messages and "sudoreplay -l"
   output are now escaped in octal format.  Space characters in the
   command path are also escaped.  Command line arguments that
   contain spaces are surrounded by single quotes and any literal
   single quote or backslash characters are escaped with a backslash.
   This makes it possible to distinguish multiple command line
   arguments from a single argument that contains spaces.

 * Improved support for DragonFly BSD which uses a different struct
   procinfo than either FreeBSD or 4.4BSD.

 * Fixed a compilation error on Linux arm systems running older
   kernels that may not define EM_ARM in linux/elf-em.h.
   GitHub issue #232.

 * Fixed a compilation error when LDFLAGS contains -Wl,--no-undefined.
   Sudo will now link using -Wl,--no-undefined by default if possible.
   GitHub issue #234.

 * Fixed a bug executing a command with a very long argument vector
   when "log_subcmds" or "intercept" is enabled on a system where
   "intercept_type" is set to "trace".  GitHub issue #194.

 * When sudo is configured to run a command in a pseudo-terminal
   but the standard input is not connected to a terminal, the command
   will now be run as a background process.  This works around a
   problem running sudo commands in the background from a shell
   script where changing the terminal to raw mode could interfere
   with the interactive shell that ran the script.
   GitHub issue #237.

 * A missing include file in sudoers is no longer a fatal error
   unless the error_recovery plugin argument has been set to false.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.12p2

 * Fixed a compilation error on Linux/aarch64.  GitHub issue #197.

 * Fixed a potential crash introduced in the fix for GitHub issue #134.
   If a user's sudoers entry did not have any RunAs user's set,
   running "sudo -U otheruser -l" would dereference a NULL pointer.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.12 that could prevent sudo
   from creating a I/O files when the "iolog_file" sudoers setting
   contains six or more Xs.

 * Fixed a compilation issue on AIX with the native compiler.
   GitHub issue #231.

 * Fixed CVE-2023-22809, a flaw in sudo's -e option (aka sudoedit)
   that could allow a malicious user with sudoedit privileges to
   edit arbitrary files.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.12p1

 * Sudo's configure script now does a better job of detecting when
   the -fstack-clash-protection compiler option does not work.
   GitHub issue #191.

 * Fixed CVE-2022-43995, a potential out-of-bounds write for passwords
   smaller than 8 characters when passwd authentication is enabled.
   This does not affect configurations that use other authentication
   methods such as PAM, AIX authentication or BSD authentication.

 * Fixed a build error with some configurations compiling host_port.c.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.12

 * Fixed a bug in the ptrace-based intercept mode where the current
   working directory could include garbage at the end.

 * Fixed a compilation error on systems that lack the stdint.h
   header.  Bug #1035

 * Fixed a bug when logging the command's exit status in intercept
   mode.  The wrong command could be logged with the exit status.

 * For ptrace-based intercept mode, sudo will now attempt to
   verify that the command path name, arguments and environment
   have not changed from the time when they were authorized by the
   security policy.  The new "intercept_verify" sudoers setting can
   be used to control this behavior.

 * Fixed running commands with a relative path (e.g. ./foo) in
   intercept mode.  Previously, this would fail if sudo's current
   working directory was different from that of the command.

 * Sudo now supports passing the execve(2) system call the NULL
   pointer for the `argv` and/or `envp` arguments when in intercept
   mode.  Linux treats a NULL pointer like an empty array.

 * The sudoers LDAP schema now allows sudoUser, sudoRunasUser and
   sudoRunasGroup to include UTF-8 characters, not just 7-bit ASCII.

 * Fixed a problem with "sudo -i" on SELinux when the target user's
   home directory is not searchable by sudo.  GitHub issue #160.

 * Neovim has been added to the list of visudo editors that support
   passing the line number on the command line.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo's SHA384 and SHA512 message digest padding.

 * Added a new "-N" (--no-update) command line option to sudo which
   can be used to prevent sudo from updating the user's cached
   credentials.  It is now possible to determine whether or not a
   user's cached credentials are currently valid by running:

	$ sudo -Nnv

   and checking the exit value.  One use case for this is to indicate
   in a shell prompt that sudo is "active" for the user.

 * PAM approval modules are no longer invoked when running sub-commands
   in intercept mode unless the "intercept_authenticate" option is set.
   There is a substantial performance penalty for calling into PAM
   for each command run.  PAM approval modules are still called for
   the initial command.

 * Intercept mode on Linux now uses process_vm_readv(2) and
   process_vm_writev(2) if available.

 * The XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment variable is now preserved
   by default.  This makes it possible for graphical applications
   to choose the correct theme when run via sudo.

 * On 64-bit systems, if sudo fails to load a sudoers group plugin,
   it will use system-specific heuristics to try to locate a 64-bit
   version of the plugin.

 * The cvtsudoers manual now documents the JSON and CSV output
   formats.  GitHub issue #172.

 * Fixed a bug where sub-commands were not being logged to a remote
   log server when log_subcmds was enabled.  GitHub issue #174.

 * The new log_stdin, log_stdout, log_stderr, log_ttyin, and log_ttyout
   sudoers settings can be used to support more fine-grained I/O logging.
   The sudo front-end no longer allocates a pseudo-terminal when running
   a command if the I/O logging plugin requests logging of stdin, stdout,
   or stderr but not terminal input/output.

 * Quieted a libgcrypt run-time initialization warning.
   This fixes Debian bug #1019428 and Ubuntu bug #1397663.

 * Fixed a bug in visudo that caused literal backslashes to be removed
   from the EDITOR environment variable.  GitHub issue #179.

 * The sudo Python plugin now implements the "find_spec" method instead
   of the the deprecated "find_module".  This fixes a test failure when
   a newer version of setuptools that doesn't include "find_module" is
   found on the system.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.9 where sudo_logsrvd created
   the process ID file, usually /var/run/sudo/sudo_logsrvd.pid, as
   a directory instead of a plain file.  The same bug could result
   in I/O log directories that end in six or more X's being created
   literally in addition to the name being used as a template for
   the mkdtemp(3) function.

 * Fixed a long-standing bug where a sudoers rule with a command
   line argument of "", which indicates the command may be run with
   no arguments, would also match a literal "" on the command line.
   GitHub issue #182.

 * Added the -I option to visudo which only edits the main sudoers
   file.  Include files are not edited unless a syntax error is found.

 * Fixed "sudo -l -U otheruser" output when the runas list is empty.
   Previously, sudo would list the invoking user instead of the
   list user.  GitHub issue #183.

 * Fixed the display of command tags and options in "sudo -l" output
   when the RunAs user or group changes.  A new line is started for
   RunAs changes which means we need to display the command tags
   and options again.  GitHub issue #184.

 * The sesh helper program now uses getopt_long(3) to parse the
   command line options.

 * The embedded copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.2.13.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented event log data from being sent to the
   log server when I/O logging was not enabled.  This only affected
   systems without PAM or configurations where the pam_session and
   pam_setcred options were disabled in the sudoers file.

 * Fixed a bug where "sudo -l" output included a carriage return
   after the newline.  This is only needed when displaying to a
   terminal in raw mode.  Bug #1042.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.11p3

 * Fixed "connection reset" errors on AIX when running shell scripts
   with the "intercept" or "log_subcmds" sudoers options enabled.
   Bug #1034.

 * Fixed very slow execution of shell scripts when the "intercept"
   or "log_subcmds" sudoers options are set on systems that enable
   Nagle's algorithm on the loopback device, such as AIX.
   Bug #1034.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.11p2

 * Fixed a compilation error on Linux/x86_64 with the x32 ABI.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.9.11p1 that caused a warning
   when logging to sudo_logsrvd if the command returned no output.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.11p1

 * Correctly handle EAGAIN in the I/O read/right events.  This fixes
   a hang seen on some systems when piping a large amount of data
   through sudo, such as via rsync.  Bug #963.

 * Changes to avoid implementation or unspecified behavior when
   bit shifting signed values in the protobuf library.

 * Fixed a compilation error on Linux/aarch64.

 * Fixed the configure check for seccomp(2) support on Linux.

 * Corrected the EBNF specification for tags in the sudoers manual
   page.  GitHub issue #153.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.11

 * Fixed a crash in the Python module with Python 3.9.10 on some
   systems.  Additionally, "make check" now passes for Python 3.9.10.

 * Error messages sent via email now include more details, including
   the file name and the line number and column of the error.
   Multiple errors are sent in a single message.  Previously, only
   the first error was included.

 * Fixed logging of parse errors in JSON format.  Previously,
   the JSON logger would not write entries unless the command and
   runuser were set.  These may not be known at the time a parse
   error is encountered.

 * Fixed a potential crash parsing sudoers lines larger than twice
   the value of LINE_MAX on systems that lack the getdelim() function.

 * The tests run by "make check" now unset the LANGUAGE environment
   variable.  Otherwise, localization strings will not match if
   LANGUAGE is set to a non-English locale.  Bug #1025.

 * The "starttime" test now passed when run under Debian faketime.
   Bug #1026.

 * The Kerberos authentication module now honors the custom password
   prompt if one has been specified.

 * The embedded copy of zlib has been updated to version 1.2.12.

 * Updated the version of libtool used by sudo to version 2.4.7.

 * Sudo now defines _TIME_BITS to 64 on systems that define __TIMESIZE
   in the header files (currently only GNU libc).  This is required
   to allow the use of 64-bit time values on some 32-bit systems.

 * Sudo's "intercept" and "log_subcmds" options no longer force the
   command to run in its own pseudo-terminal.  It is now also
   possible to intercept the system(3) function.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd when run in store-first relay mode
   where the commit point messages sent by the server were incorrect
   if the command was suspended or received a window size change
   event.

 * Fixed a potential crash in sudo_logsrvd when the "tls_dhparams"
   configuration setting was used.

 * The "intercept" and "log_subcmds" functionality can now use
   ptrace(2) on Linux systems that support seccomp(2) filtering.
   This has the advantage of working for both static and dynamic
   binaries and can work with sudo's SELinux RBAC mode.  The following
   architectures are currently supported: i386, x86_64, aarch64,
   arm, mips (log_subcmds only), powerpc, riscv, and s390x.  The
   default is to use ptrace(2) where possible; the new "intercept_type"
   sudoers setting can be used to explicitly set the type.

 * New Georgian translation from translationproject.org.

 * Fixed creating packages on CentOS Stream.

 * Fixed a bug in the intercept and log_subcmds support where
   the execve(2) wrapper was using the current environment instead
   of the passed environment pointer.  Bug #1030.

 * Added AppArmor integration for Linux.  A sudoers rule can now
   specify an APPARMOR_PROFILE option to run a command confined by
   the named AppArmor profile.

 * Fixed parsing of the "server_log" setting in sudo_logsrvd.conf.
   Non-paths were being treated as paths and an actual path was
   treated as an error.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.10

 * Added new "log_passwords" and "passprompt_regex" sudoers options.
   If "log_passwords" is disabled, sudo will attempt to prevent passwords
   from being logged.  If sudo detects any of the regular expressions in
   the "passprompt_regex" list in the terminal output, sudo will log '*'
   characters instead of the terminal input until a newline or carriage
   return is found in the input or an output character is received.

 * Added new "log_passwords" and "passprompt_regex" settings to
   sudo_logsrvd that operate like the sudoers options when logging
   terminal input.

 * Fixed several few bugs in the cvtsudoers utility when merging
   multiple sudoers sources.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd when parsing the sudo_logsrvd.conf
   file, where the "retry_interval" in the [relay] section was not
   being recognized.

 * Restored the pre-1.9.9 behavior of not performing authentication
   when sudo's -n option is specified.  A new "noninteractive_auth"
   sudoers option has been added to enable PAM authentication in
   non-interactive mode.  GitHub issue #131.

 * On systems with /proc, if the /proc/self/stat (Linux) or
   /proc/pid/psinfo (other systems) file is missing or invalid,
   sudo will now check file descriptors 0-2 to determine the user's
   terminal.  Bug #1020.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on Debian kFreeBSD.  Bug #1021.

 * Fixed a crash in sudo_logsrvd when running in relay mode if
   an alert message is received.

 * Fixed an issue that resulting in "problem with defaults entries"
   email to be sent if a user ran sudo when the sudoers entry in
   the nsswitch.conf file includes "sss" but no sudo provider is
   configured in /etc/sssd/sssd.conf.  Bug #1022.

 * Updated the warning displayed when the invoking user is not
   allowed to run sudo.  If sudo has been configured to send mail
   on failed attempts (see the mail_* flags in sudoers), it will
   now print "This incident has been reported to the administrator."
   If the "mailto" or "mailerpath" sudoers settings are disabled,
   the message will not be printed and no mail will be sent.
   GitHub issue #48.

 * Fixed a bug where the user-specified command timeout was not
   being honored if the sudoers rule did not also specify a timeout.

 * Added support for using POSIX extended regular expressions in
   sudoers rules.  A command and/or arguments in sudoers are treated
   as a regular expression if they start with a '^' character and
   end with a '$'.  The command and arguments are matched separately,
   either one (or both) may be a regular expression.
   Bug #578, GitHub issue #15.

 * A user may now only run "sudo -U otheruser -l" if they have a
   "sudo ALL" privilege where the RunAs user contains either "root"
   or "otheruser".  Previously, having "sudo ALL" was sufficient,
   regardless of the RunAs user.  GitHub issue #134.

 * The sudo lecture is now displayed immediately before the password
   prompt.  As a result, sudo will no longer display the lecture
   unless the user needs to enter a password.  Authentication methods
   that don't interact with the user via a terminal do not trigger
   the lecture.

 * Sudo now uses its own closefrom() emulation on Linux systems.
   The glibc version may not work in a chroot jail where /proc is
   not available.  If close_range(2) is present, it will be used
   in preference to /proc/self/fd.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.9

 * Sudo can now be built with OpenSSL 3.0 without generating warnings
   about deprecated OpenSSL APIs.

 * A digest can now be specified along with the "ALL" command in
   the LDAP and SSSD back-ends.  Sudo 1.9.0 introduced support for
   this in the sudoers file but did not include corresponding changes
   for the other back-ends.

 * visudo now only warns about an undefined alias or a cycle in an
   alias once for each alias.
 
 * The sudoRole cn was truncated by a single character in warning messages.
   GitHub issue #115.

 * The cvtsudoers utility has new --group-file and --passwd-file options
   to use a custom passwd or group file when the --match-local option is
   also used.

 * The cvtsudoers utility can now filter or match based on a command.

 * The cvtsudoers utility can now produce output in csv (comma-separated
   value) format.  This can be used to help generate entitlement reports.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd that could result in the connection being
   dropped for very long command lines.

 * Fixed a bug where sudo_logsrvd would not accept a restore point
   of zero.

 * Fixed a bug in visudo where the value of the "editor" setting was not
   used if it did not match the user's EDITOR environment variable.
   This was only a problem if the "env_editor" setting was not enabled.
   Bug #1000.

 * Sudo now builds with the -fcf-protection compiler option and the
   "-z now" linker option if supported.

 * The output of "sudoreplay -l" now more closely matches the
   traditional sudo log format.

 * The sudo_sendlog utility will now use the full contents of the log.json
   file, if present.  This makes it possible to send sudo-format I/O logs
   that use the newer log.json format to sudo_logsrvd without losing any
   information.

 * Fixed compilation of the arc4random_buf() replacement on systems with
   arc4random() but no arc4random_buf().  Bug #1008.

 * Sudo now uses its own getentropy() by default on Linux.  The GNU libc
   version of getentropy() will fail on older kernels that don't support
   the getrandom() system call.

 * It is now possible to build sudo with WolfSSL's OpenSSL compatibility
   layer by using the --enable-wolfssl configure option.

 * Fixed a bug related to Daylight Saving Time when parsing timestamps
   in Generalized Time format.  This affected the NOTBEFORE and
   NOTAFTER options in sudoers.  Bug #1006

 * Added the -O and -P options to visudo, which can be used to check
   or set the owner and permissions.  This can be used in conjunction
   with the -c option to check that the sudoers file ownership and
   permissions are correct.  Bug #1007.

 * It is now possible to set resource limits in the sudoers file itself.
   The special values "default" and "user" refer to the default system
   limit and invoking user limit respectively.  The core dump size limit
   is now set to 0 by default unless overridden by the sudoers file.

 * The cvtsudoers utility can now merge multiple sudoers sources into
   a single, combined sudoers file.  If there are conflicting entries,
   cvtsudoers will attempt to resolve them but manual intervention
   may be required.  The merging of sudoers rules is currently fairly
   simplistic but will be improved in a future release.

 * Sudo was parsing but not applying the "deref" and "tls_reqcert"
   ldap.conf settings.  This meant the options were effectively
   ignored which broke dereferencing of aliases in LDAP.  Bug #1013.

 * Clarified in the sudo man page that the security policy may
   override the user's PATH environment variable.  Bug #1014.

 * When sudo is run in non-interactive mode (with the -n option), it
   will now attempt PAM authentication and only exit with an error
   if user interaction is required.  This allows PAM modules that
   don't interact with the user to succeed.  Previously, sudo
   would not attempt authentication if the -n option was specified.
   Bug #956 and GitHub issue #83.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in version 1.9.1 when sudo is
   built with the --with-fqdn configure option.  The local host
   name was being resolved before the sudoers file was processed,
   making it impossible to disable DNS lookups by negating the
   "fqdn" sudoers option.  Bug #1016.

 * Added support for negated sudoUser attributes in the LDAP and
   SSSD sudoers back ends.  A matching sudoUser that is negated
   will cause the sudoRole containing it to be ignored.

 * Fixed a bug where the stack resource limit could be set to a
   value smaller than that of the invoking user and not be reset
   before the command was run.  Bug #1017.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.8p2

 * Fixed a potential out-of-bounds read with "sudo -i" when the
   target user's shell is bash.  This is a regression introduced
   in sudo 1.9.8.  Bug #998.

 * sudo_logsrvd now only sends a log ID for first command of a session.
   There is no need to send the log ID for each sub-command.

 * Fixed a few minor memory leaks in intercept mode.

 * Fixed a problem with sudo_logsrvd in relay mode if "store_first"
   was enabled when handling sub-commands.  A new zero-length journal
   file was created for each sub-command instead of simply using
   the existing journal file.

 * Fixed a bug where sudoedit would fail if one of the directories
   in the path to be edited had the immutable flag set (BSD, Linux
   or macOS).  GitHub issue #122.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.8p1

 * Fixed support for passing a prompt (sudo -p) or a login class
   (sudo -c) on the command line.  This is a regression introduced
   in sudo 1.9.8.  Bug #993.

 * Fixed a crash with "sudo ALL" rules in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends.
   This is a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.8.  Bug #994.

 * Fixed a compilation error when the --enable-static-sudoers configure
   option was specified.  This is a regression introduced in sudo
   1.9.8 caused by a symbol clash with the intercept and log server
   protobuf functions.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.8

 * It is now possible to transparently intercepting sub-commands
   executed by the original command run via sudo.  Intercept support
   is implemented using LD_PRELOAD (or the equivalent supported by
   the system) and so has some limitations.  The two main limitations
   are that only dynamic executables are supported and only the
   execl, execle, execlp, execv, execve, execvp, and execvpe library
   functions are currently intercepted. Its main use case is to
   support restricting privileged shells run via sudo.

   To support this, there is a new "intercept" Defaults setting and
   an INTERCEPT command tag that can be used in sudoers.  For example:

    Cmnd_Alias SHELLS=/bin/bash, /bin/sh, /bin/csh, /bin/ksh, /bin/zsh
    Defaults!SHELLS intercept

   would cause sudo to run the listed shells in intercept mode.
   This can also be set on a per-rule basis.  For example:

    Cmnd_Alias SHELLS=/bin/bash, /bin/sh, /bin/csh, /bin/ksh, /bin/zsh
    chuck ALL = INTERCEPT: SHELLS

   would only apply intercept mode to user "chuck" when running one
   of the listed shells.

   In intercept mode, sudo will not prompt for a password before
   running a sub-command and will not allow a set-user-ID or
   set-group-ID program to be run by default.  The new
   intercept_authenticate and intercept_allow_setid sudoers settings
   can be used to change this behavior.

 * The new "log_subcmds" sudoers setting can be used to log additional
   commands run in a privileged shell.  It uses the same mechanism as
   the intercept support described above and has the same limitations.

 * The new "log_exit_status" sudoers setting can be used to log
   the exit status commands run via sudo.  This is also a corresponding
   "log_exit" setting in the sudo_logsrvd.conf eventlog stanza.
 
 * Support for logging sudo_logsrvd errors via syslog or to a file.
   Previously, most sudo_logsrvd errors were only visible in the
   debug log.

 * Better diagnostics when there is a TLS certificate validation error.

 * Using the "+=" or "-=" operators in a Defaults setting that takes
   a string, not a list, now produces a warning from sudo and a
   syntax error from inside visudo.

 * Fixed a bug where the "iolog_mode" setting in sudoers and sudo_logsrvd
   had no effect when creating I/O log parent directories if the I/O log
   file name ended with the string "XXXXXX".

 * Fixed a bug in the sudoers custom prompt code where the size
   parameter that was passed to the strlcpy() function was incorrect.
   No overflow was possible since the correct amount of memory was
   already pre-allocated.

 * The mksigname and mksiglist helper programs are now built with
   the host compiler, not the target compiler, when cross-compiling.
   Bug #989.

 * Fixed compilation error when the --enable-static-sudoers configure
   option was specified.  This was due to a typo introduced in sudo
   1.9.7.  GitHub PR #113.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.7p2

 * When formatting JSON output, octal numbers are now stored as
   strings, not numbers.  The JSON spec does not actually support
   octal numbers with a '0' prefix.

 * Fixed a compilation issue on Solaris 9.

 * Sudo now can handle the getgroups() function returning a different
   number of groups for subsequent invocations.  GitHub PR #106.

 * When loading a Python plugin, python_plugin.so now verifies
   that the module loaded matches the one we tried to load.  This
   allows sudo to display a more useful error message when trying
   to load a plugin with a name that conflicts with a Python module
   installed in the system location.

 * Sudo no longer sets the the open files resource limit to "unlimited"
   while it runs.  This avoids a problem where sudo's closefrom()
   emulation would need to close a very large number of descriptors
   on systems without a way to determine which ones are actually open.

 * Sudo now includes a configure check for va_copy or __va_copy and
   only defines its own version if the configure test fails.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo's utmp file handling which prevented old
   entries from being reused.  As a result, the utmp (or utmpx)
   file was appended to unnecessarily.  GitHub PR #108.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.7 that prevented sudo_logsrvd
   from accepting TLS connections when OpenSSL is used.  Bug #988.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.7p1

 * Fixed an SELinux sudoedit bug when the edited temporary file
   could not be opened.  The sesh helper would still be run even
   when there are no temporary files available to install.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on FreeBSD.

 * The sudo_noexec.so file is now built as a module on all systems
   other than macOS.  This makes it possible to use other libtool
   implementations such as slibtool.  On macOS shared libraries and
   modules are not interchangeable and the version of libtool shipped
   with sudo must be used.

 * Fixed a few bugs in the getgrouplist() emulation on Solaris when
   reading from the local group file.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd that prevented periodic relay server
   connection retries from occurring in "store_first" mode.

 * Disabled the nss_search()-based getgrouplist() emulation on HP-UX
   due to a crash when the group source is set to "compat" in
   /etc/nsswitch.conf.  This is probably due to a mismatch between
   include/compat/nss_dbdefs.h and what HP-UX uses internally.  On
   HP-UX we now just cycle through groups the slow way using
   getgrent().  Bug #978.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.7

 * The "fuzz" Makefile target now runs all the fuzzers for 8192
   passes (can be overridden via the FUZZ_RUNS variable).  This makes
   it easier to run the fuzzers in-tree.  To run a fuzzer indefinitely,
   set FUZZ_RUNS=-1, e.g. "make FUZZ_RUNS=-1 fuzz".

 * Fixed fuzzing on FreeBSD where the ld.lld linker returns an
   error by default when a symbol is multiply-defined.

 * Added support for determining local IPv6 addresses on systems
   that lack the getifaddrs() function.  This now works on AIX,
   HP-UX and Solaris (at least).  Bug #969.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.6 that caused "sudo -V" to
   report a usage error.  Also, when invoked as sudoedit, sudo now
   allows a more restricted set of options that matches the usage
   statement and documentation.  GitHub issue #95.

 * Fixed a crash in sudo_sendlog when the specified certificate
   or key does not exist or is invalid.  Bug #970

 * Fixed a compilation error when sudo is configured with the
   --disable-log-client option.

 * Sudo's limited support for SUCCESS=return entries in nsswitch.conf
   is now documented.  Bug #971.

 * Sudo now requires autoconf 2.70 or higher to regenerate the
   configure script.  Bug #972.

 * sudo_logsrvd now has a relay mode which can be used to create
   a hierarchy of log servers.  By default, when a relay server is
   defined, messages from the client are forwarded immediately to
   the relay.  However, if the "store_first" setting is enabled,
   the log will be stored locally until the command completes and
   then relayed.  Bug #965.

 * Sudo now links with OpenSSL by default if it is available unless
   the --disable-openssl configure option is used or both the
   --disable-log-client and --disable-log-server configure options
   are specified.

 * Fixed configure's Python version detection when the version minor
   number is more than a single digit, for example Python 3.10.

 * The sudo Python module tests now pass for Python 3.10.

 * Sudo will now avoid changing the datasize resource limit
   as long as the existing value is at least 1GB.  This works around
   a problem on 64-bit HP-UX where it is not possible to exactly
   restore the original datasize limit.  Bug #973.

 * Fixed a race condition that could result in a hang when sudo is
   executed by a process where the SIGCHLD handler is set to SIG_IGN.
   This fixes the bug described by GitHub PR #98.

 * Fixed an out-of-bounds read in sudoedit and visudo when the
   EDITOR, VISUAL or SUDO_EDITOR environment variables end in an
   unescaped backslash.  Also fixed the handling of quote characters
   that are escaped by a backslash.  GitHub issue #99.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented the "log_server_verify" sudoers option
   from taking effect.

 * The sudo_sendlog utility has a new -s option to cause it to stop
   sending I/O records after a user-specified elapsed time.  This
   can be used to test the I/O log restart functionality of sudo_logsrvd.

 * Fixed a crash introduced in sudo 1.9.4 in sudo_logsrvd when
   attempting to restart an interrupted I/O log transfer.

 * The TLS connection timeout in the sudoers log client was previously
   hard-coded to 10 seconds.  It now uses the value of log_server_timeout.

 * The configure script now outputs a summary of the user-configurable
   options at the end, separate from output of configure script tests.
   Bug #820.

 * Corrected the description of which groups may be specified via the
   -g option in the Runas_Spec section.  Bug #975.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.6p1

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.6 that resulted in an
   error message instead of a usage message when sudo is run with
   no arguments.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.6

 * Fixed a sudo_sendlog compilation problem with the AIX xlC compiler.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.4 where the
   --disable-root-mailer configure option had no effect.

 * Added a --disable-leaks configure option that avoids some
   memory leaks on exit that would otherwise occur.  This is intended
   to be used with development tools that measure memory leaks.  It
   is not safe to use in production at this time.

 * Plugged some memory leaks identified by oss-fuzz and ASAN.

 * Fixed the handling of sudoOptions for an LDAP sudoRole that
   contains multiple sudoCommands.  Previously, some of the options
   would only be applied to the first sudoCommand.

 * Fixed a potential out of bounds read in the parsing of NOTBEFORE
   and NOTAFTER sudoers command options (and their LDAP equivalents).

 * The parser used for reading I/O log JSON files is now more
   resilient when processing invalid JSON.

 * Fixed typos that prevented "make uninstall" from working.
   GitHub issue #87.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.4 where the last line
   in a sudoers file might not have a terminating NUL character
   added if no newline was present.

 * Integrated oss-fuzz and LLVM's libFuzzer with sudo.  The new
   --enable-fuzzer configure option can be combined with the
   --enable-sanitizer option to build sudo with fuzzing support.
   Multiple fuzz targets are available for fuzzing different parts
   of sudo.  Fuzzers are built and tested via "make fuzz" or as part
   of "make check" (even when sudo is not built with fuzzing support).
   Fuzzing support currently requires the LLVM clang compiler (not gcc).

 * Fixed the --enable-static-sudoers configure option.
   GitHub issue #92.

 * Fixed a potential out of bounds read sudo when is run by a user
   with more groups than the value of "max_groups" in sudo.conf.

 * Added an "admin_flag" sudoers option to make the use of the
   ~/.sudo_as_admin_successful file configurable on systems where
   sudo is build with the --enable-admin-flag configure option.
   This mostly affects Ubuntu and its derivatives.  GitHub issue #56.

 * The "max_groups" setting in sudo.conf is now limited to 1024.
   This setting is obsolete and should no longer be needed.

 * Fixed a bug in the tilde expansion of "CHROOT=dir" and "CWD=dir"
   sudoers command options.  A path "~/foo" was expanded to
   "/home/userfoo" instead of "/home/user/foo".  This also affects
   the runchroot and runcwd Defaults settings.

 * Fixed a bug on systems without a native getdelim(3) function
   where very long lines could cause parsing of the sudoers file
   to end prematurely.  Bug #960.

 * Fixed a potential integer overflow when converting the
   timestamp_timeout and passwd_timeout sudoers settings to a
   timespec struct.

 * The default for the "group_source" setting in sudo.conf is now
   "dynamic" on macOS.  Recent versions of macOS do not reliably
   return all of a user's non-local groups via getgroups(2), even
   when _DARWIN_UNLIMITED_GETGROUPS is defined.  Bug #946.

 * Fixed a potential use-after-free in the PAM conversation function.
   Bug #967.

 * Fixed potential redefinition of sys/stat.h macros in sudo_compat.h.
   Bug #968.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.5p2

 * Fixed sudo's setprogname(3) emulation on systems that don't
   provide it.

 * Fixed a problem with the sudoers log server client where a partial
   write to the server could result the sudo process consuming large
   amounts of CPU time due to a cycle in the buffer queue. Bug #954.

 * Added a missing dependency on libsudo_util in libsudo_eventlog.
   Fixes a link error when building sudo statically.

 * The user's KRB5CCNAME environment variable is now preserved when
   performing PAM authentication.  This fixes GSSAPI authentication
   when the user has a non-default ccache.

 * When invoked as sudoedit, the same set of command line options
   are now accepted as for "sudo -e".  The -H and -P options are
   now rejected for sudoedit and "sudo -e" which matches the sudo
   1.7 behavior.  This is part of the fix for CVE-2021-3156.

 * Fixed a potential buffer overflow when unescaping backslashes
   in the command's arguments.  Normally, sudo escapes special
   characters when running a command via a shell (sudo -s or sudo
   -i).  However, it was also possible to run sudoedit with the -s
   or -i flags in which case no escaping had actually been done,
   making a buffer overflow possible.  This fixes CVE-2021-3156.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.5p1

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.5 where the editor run
   by sudoedit was set-user-ID root unless SELinux RBAC was in use.
   The editor is now run with the user's real and effective user-IDs.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.5

 * Fixed a crash introduced in 1.9.4 when running "sudo -i" as an
   unknown user.  This is related to but distinct from Bug #948.

 * If the "lecture_file" setting is enabled in sudoers, it must now
   refer to a regular file or a symbolic link to a regular file.

 * Fixed a potential use-after-free bug in sudo_logsrvd when the
   server shuts down if there are existing connections from clients
   that are only logging events and not session I/O data.

 * Fixed a buffer size mismatch when serializing the list of IP
   addresses for configured network interfaces.  This bug is not
   actually exploitable since the allocated buffer is large enough
   to hold the list of addresses.

 * If sudo is executed with a name other than "sudo" or "sudoedit",
   it will now fall back to "sudo" as the program name.  This affects
   warning, help and usage messages as well as the matching of Debug
   lines in the /etc/sudo.conf file.  Previously, it was possible
   for the invoking user to manipulate the program name by setting
   argv[0] to an arbitrary value when executing sudo.

 * Sudo now checks for failure when setting the close-on-exec flag
   on open file descriptors.  This should never fail but, if it
   were to, there is the possibility of a file descriptor leak to
   a child process (such as the command sudo runs).

 * Fixed CVE-2021-23239, a potential information leak in sudoedit
   that could be used to test for the existence of directories not
   normally accessible to the user in certain circumstances.  When
   creating a new file, sudoedit checks to make sure the parent
   directory of the new file exists before running the editor.
   However, a race condition exists if the invoking user can replace
   (or create) the parent directory.  If a symbolic link is created
   in place of the parent directory, sudoedit will run the editor
   as long as the target of the link exists.  If the target of the
   link does not exist, an error message will be displayed.  The
   race condition can be used to test for the existence of an
   arbitrary directory.  However, it _cannot_ be used to write to
   an arbitrary location.

 * Fixed CVE-2021-23240, a flaw in the temporary file handling of
   sudoedit's SELinux RBAC support.  On systems where SELinux is
   enabled, a user with sudoedit permissions may be able to set the
   owner of an arbitrary file to the user-ID of the target user.
   On Linux kernels that support "protected symlinks", setting
   /proc/sys/fs/protected_symlinks to 1 will prevent the bug from
   being exploited.  For more information see
   https://www.sudo.ws/alerts/sudoedit_selinux.html.

 * Added writability checks for sudoedit when SELinux RBAC is in use.
   This makes sudoedit behavior consistent regardless of whether
   or not SELinux RBAC is in use.  Previously, the "sudoedit_checkdir"
   setting had no effect for RBAC entries.

 * A new sudoers option "selinux" can be used to disable sudo's
   SELinux RBAC support.

 * Quieted warnings from PVS Studio, clang analyzer, and cppcheck.
   Added suppression annotations for PVS Studio false positives.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.4p2

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.9.4p1 which could lead to a crash
   if the sudoers file contains a runas user-specific Defaults entry.
   Bug #951.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.4p1

 * Sudo on macOS now supports users with more than 16 groups without
   needing to set "group_source" to "dynamic" in /etc/sudo.conf.
   Previously, only the first 15 were used when matching group-based
   rules in sudoers.  Bug #946.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in version 1.9.4 where sudo would
   not build when configured using the --without-sendmail option.
   Bug #947.

 * Fixed a problem where if I/O logging was disabled and sudo was
   unable to connect to sudo_logsrvd, the command would still be
   allowed to run even when the "ignore_logfile_errors" sudoers
   option was enabled.

 * Fixed a crash introduced in version 1.9.4 when attempting to run
   a command as a non-existent user.  Bug #948.

 * The installed sudo.conf file now has the default sudoers Plugin
   lines commented out.  This fixes a potential conflict when there
   is both a system-installed version of sudo and a user-installed
   version.  GitHub issue #75.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.4 where sudo would run
   the command as a child process even when a pseudo-terminal was
   not in use and the "pam_session" and "pam_setcred" options were
   disabled.  GitHub issue #76.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.9 where the "closefrom"
   sudoers option could not be set to a value of 3.  Bug #950.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.4

 * The sudoers parser will now detect when an upper-case reserved
   word is used when declaring an alias.  Now instead of "syntax
   error, unexpected CHROOT, expecting ALIAS" the message will be
   "syntax error, reserved word CHROOT used as an alias name".
   Bug #941.

 * Better handling of sudoers files without a final newline.
   The parser now adds a newline at end-of-file automatically which
   removes the need for special cases in the parser.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 in the sssd back-end
   where an uninitialized pointer could be freed on an error path.
   GitHub issue #67.

 * The core logging code is now shared between sudo_logsrvd and
   the sudoers plugin.

 * JSON log entries sent to syslog now use "minimal" JSON which
   skips all non-essential white space.

 * The sudoers plugin can now produce JSON-formatted logs.  The
   "log_format" sudoers option can be used to select sudo or json
   format logs.  The default is sudo format logs.

 * The sudoers plugin and visudo now display the column number in
   syntax error messages in addition to the line number.  Bug #841.

 * If I/O logging is not enabled but "log_servers" is set, the
   sudoers plugin will now log accept events to sudo_logsrvd.
   Previously, the accept event was only sent when I/O logging was
   enabled.  The sudoers plugin now sends reject and alert events too.

 * The sudo logsrv protocol has been extended to allow an AlertMessage
   to contain an optional array of InfoMessage, as AcceptMessage
   and RejectMessage already do.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo_logsrvd where receipt of SIGHUP would result
   in duplicate entries in the debug log when debugging was enabled.

 * The visudo utility now supports EDITOR environment variables
   that use single or double quotes in the command arguments.
   Bug #942.

 * The PAM session modules now run when sudo is set-user-ID root,
   which allows a module to determine the original user-ID.
   Bug #944.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 in the LDAP back-end
   where sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter were applied even when the
   SUDOERS_TIMED setting was not present in ldap.conf.  Bug #945.

 * Sudo packages for macOS 11 now contain universal binaries that
   support both Intel and Apple Silicon CPUs.

 * For sudo_logsrvd, an empty value for the "pid_file" setting in
   sudo_logsrvd.conf will now disable the process ID file.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.3p1

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.3 where the configure
   script would not detect the crypt(3) function if it was present
   in the C library, not an additional library.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 with shadow passwd
   file authentication on OpenBSD.  BSD authentication was not
   affected.

 * Sudo now logs when a user-specified command-line option is
   rejected by a sudoers rule.  Previously, these conditions were
   written to the audit log, but the default sudo log file.  Affected
   command line arguments include -C (--close-from), -D (--chdir),
   -R (--chroot), -g (--group) and -u (--user).

What's new in Sudo 1.9.3

 * sudoedit will now prompt the user before overwriting an existing
   file with one that is zero-length after editing.  Bug #922.

 * Fixed building the Python plugin on systems with a compiler that
   doesn't support symbol hiding.

 * Sudo now uses a linker script to hide symbols even when the
   compiler supports symbol hiding.  This should make it easier to
   detect omissions in the symbol exports file, regardless of the
   platform.

 * Fixed the libssl dependency in Debian packages for older releases
   that use libssl1.0.0.

 * Sudo and visudo now provide more detailed messages when a syntax
   error is detected in sudoers.  The offending line and token are
   now displayed.  If the parser was generated by GNU bison,
   additional information about what token was expected is also
   displayed.  Bug #841.

 * Sudoers rules must now end in either a newline or the end-of-file.
   Previously, it was possible to have multiple rules on a single
   line, separated by white space.  The use of an end-of-line
   terminator makes it possible to display accurate error messages.

 * Sudo no longer refuses to run if a syntax error in the sudoers
   file is encountered.  The entry with the syntax error will be
   discarded and sudo will continue to parse the file.  This makes
   recovery from a syntax error less painful on systems where sudo
   is the primary method of superuser access.  The historic behavior
   can be restored by add "error_recovery=false" to the sudoers
   plugin's optional arguments in sudo.conf.  Bug #618.

 * Fixed the sample_approval plugin's symbol exports file for systems
   where the compiler doesn't support symbol hiding.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 where arguments to
   the "sudoers_policy" plugin in sudo.conf were not being applied.
   The sudoers file is now parsed by the "sudoers_audit" plugin,
   which is loaded implicitly when "sudoers_policy" is listed in
   sudo.conf.  Starting with sudo 1.9.3, if there are plugin arguments
   for "sudoers_policy" but "sudoers_audit" is not listed, those
   arguments will be applied to "sudoers_audit" instead.

 * The user's resource limits are now passed to sudo plugins in
   the user_info[] list.  A plugin cannot determine the limits
   itself because sudo changes the limits while it runs to prevent
   resource starvation.

 * It is now possible to set the working directory or change the
   root directory on a per-command basis using the CWD and CHROOT
   options.  CWD and CHROOT are now reserved words in sudoers--they
   can no longer be used as alias names.  There are also new Defaults
   settings, runchroot and runcwd, that can be used to set the
   working directory or root directory on a more global basis.

 * New -D (--chdir) and -R (--chroot) command line options can be
   used to set the working directory or root directory if the sudoers
   file allows it.  This functionality is not enabled by default
   and must be explicitly enabled in the sudoers file.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.1 where the sudoers_audit
   symbol could not be resolved when sudo is configured with the
   --enable-static-sudoers option.  Bug #936 and GitHub issue #61.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.2

 * Fixed package builds on RedHat Enterprise Linux 8.

 * The configure script now uses pkg-config to find the openssl
   cflags and libs where possible.

 * The contents of the log.json I/O log file is now documented in
   the sudoers manual.

 * The sudoers plugin now properly exports the sudoers_audit symbol
   on systems where the compiler lacks symbol visibility controls.
   This caused a regression in 1.9.1 where a successful sudo command
   was not logged due to the missing audit plugin.  Bug #931.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.9.1 that can result in crash
   when there is a syntax error in the sudoers file.  Bug #934.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.1

 * Fixed an AIX-specific problem when I/O logging was enabled.
   The terminal device was not being properly set to raw mode.
   Bug #927.

 * Corrected handling of sudo_logsrvd connections without associated
   I/O log data.  This fixes support for RejectMessage as well as
   AcceptMessage when the expect_iobufs flag is not set.

 * Added an "iolog_path" entry to the JSON-format event log produced
   by sudo_logsrvd.  Previously, it was only possible to determine
   the I/O log file an event belonged to using sudo-format logs.

 * Fixed the bundle IDs for sudo-logsrvd and sudo-python macOS packages.

 * I/O log files produced by the sudoers plugin now clear the write
   bits on the I/O log timing file when the log is complete.  This
   is consistent with how sudo_logsrvd indicates that a log is
   complete.

 * The sudoreplay utility has a new "-F" (follow) command line
   option to allow replaying a session that is still in progress,
   similar to "tail -f".

 * The @include and @includedir directives can be used in sudoers
   instead of #include and #includedir.  In addition, include paths
   may now have embedded white space by either using a double-quoted
   string or escaping the space characters with a backslash.

 * Fixed some Solaris 11.4 compilation errors.

 * When running a command in a pty, sudo will no longer try to
   suspend itself if the user's tty has been revoked (for instance
   when the parent ssh daemon is killed).  This fixes a bug where
   sudo would continuously suspend the command (which would succeed),
   then suspend itself (which would fail due to the missing tty)
   and then resume the command.

 * If sudo's event loop fails due to the tty being revoked, remove
   the user's tty events and restart the event loop (once).  This
   fixes a problem when running "sudo reboot" in a pty on some
   systems.  When the event loop exited unexpectedly, sudo would
   kill the command running in the pty, which in the case of "reboot",
   could lead to the system being in a half-rebooted state.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.23 in the LDAP and
   SSSD back-ends where a missing sudoHost attribute was treated
   as an "ALL" wildcard value.  A sudoRole with no sudoHost attribute
   is now ignored as it was prior to version 1.8.23.

 * The audit plugin API has been changed slightly.  The sudo front-end
   now audits an accept event itself after all approval plugins are
   run and the I/O logging plugins (if any) are opened.  This makes
   it possible for an audit plugin to only log a single overall
   accept event if desired.

 * The sudoers plugin can now be loaded as an audit plugin.  Logging
   of successful commands is now performed in the audit plugin's
   accept function.  As a result, commands are now only logged if
   allowed by sudoers and all approval plugins.  Commands rejected
   by an approval plugin are now also logged by the sudoers plugin.

 * Romanian translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.0 where sudoedit did
   not remove its temporary files after installing them.  Bug #929.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.9.0 where the iolog_file
   setting in sudoers and sudo_logsrvd.conf caused an error if the
   file name ended in six or more X's.

What's new in Sudo 1.9.0

 * Fixed a test failure in the strsig_test regress test on FreeBSD.

 * The maximum length of a conversation reply has been increased
   from 255 to 1023 characters.  This allows for longer user passwords.
   Bug #860.

 * Sudo now includes a logging daemon, sudo_logsrvd, which can be
   used to implement centralized logging of I/O logs.  TLS connections
   are supported when sudo is configured with the --enable-openssl
   option.  For more information, see the sudo_logsrvd, logsrvd.conf
   and sudo_logsrv.proto manuals as well as the log_servers setting
   in the sudoers manual.

   The --disable-log-server and --disable-log-client configure
   options can be used to disable building the I/O log server and/or
   remote I/O log support in the sudoers plugin.

 * The new sudo_sendlog utility can be used to test sudo_logsrvd
   or send existing sudo I/O logs to a centralized server.

 * It is now possible to write sudo plugins in Python 3 when sudo
   is configured with the --enable-python option.  See the
   sudo_plugin_python manual for details.

   Sudo 1.9.0 comes with several Python example plugins that get
   installed sudo's examples directory.

   The sudo blog article "What's new in sudo 1.9: Python"
   (https://blog.sudo.ws/posts/2020/01/whats-new-in-sudo-1.9-python/)
   includes a simple tutorial on writing python plugins.

 * Sudo now supports an "audit" plugin type.  An audit plugin
   receives accept, reject, exit and error messages and can be used
   to implement custom logging that is independent of the underlying
   security policy.   Multiple audit plugins may be specified in
   the sudo.conf file.  A sample audit plugin is included that
   writes logs in JSON format.

 * Sudo now supports an "approval" plugin type.  An approval plugin
   is run only after the main security policy (such as sudoers) accepts
   a command to be run.  The approval policy may perform additional
   checks, potentially interacting with the user.  Multiple approval
   plugins may be specified in the sudo.conf file.  Only if all
   approval plugins succeed will the command be allowed.

 * Sudo's -S command line option now causes the sudo conversation
   function to write to the standard output or standard error instead
   of the terminal device.

 * Fixed a bug where if a #include or #includedir directive was the
   last line in sudoers and there was no final newline character, it
   was silently ignored.  Bug #917.

 * It is now possible to use "Cmd_Alias" instead of "Cmnd_Alias" for
   people who find the former more natural.

 * The new "pam_ruser" and "pam_rhost" sudoers settings can be used
   to enable or disable setting the PAM remote user and/or host
   values during PAM session setup.

 * More than one SHA-2 digest may now be specified for a single
   command.  Multiple digests must be separated by a comma.

 * It is now possible to specify a SHA-2 digest in conjunction with
   the "ALL" reserved word in a command specification.  This allows
   one to give permission to run any command that matches the
   specified digest, regardless of its path.

 * Sudo and sudo_logsrvd now create an extended I/O log info file
   in JSON format that contains additional information about the
   command that was run, such as the host name.  The sudoreplay
   utility uses this file in preference to the legacy log file.

 * The sudoreplay utility can now match on a host name in list mode.
   The list output also now includes the host name if one is present
   in the log file.

 * For "sudo -i", if the target user's home directory does not
   exist, sudo will now warn about the problem but run the command
   in the current working directory.  Previously, this was a fatal
   error.  Debian bug #598519.

 * The command line arguments in the SUDO_COMMAND environment
   variable are now truncated at 4096 characters.  This avoids an
   "Argument list too long" error when executing a command with a
   large number of arguments.  Bug #923 (Debian bug #596631).

 * Sudo now properly ends the PAM transaction when the user
   authenticates successfully but sudoers denies the command.
   Debian bug #669687.

 * The sudoers grammar in the manual now indicates that "sudoedit"
   requires one or more arguments.  Debian bug #571621.

 * When copying the edited files to the original path, sudoedit now
   allocates any additional space needed before writing.  Previously,
   it could truncate the destination file if the file system was
   full.  Bug #922.

 * Fixed an issue where PAM session modules could be called with
   the wrong user name when multiple users in the passwd database
   share the the same user-ID.  Debian bug #734752.

 * Sudo command line options that take a value may only be specified
   once.  This is to help guard against problems caused by poorly
   written scripts that invoke sudo with user-controlled input.
   Bug #924.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.31p1

 * Sudo once again ignores a failure to restore the RLIMIT_CORE
   resource limit, as it did prior to version 1.8.29.  Linux
   containers don't allow RLIMIT_CORE to be set back to RLIM_INFINITY
   if we set the limit to zero, even for root, which resulted in a
   warning from sudo.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.31

 * Fixed CVE-2019-18634, a buffer overflow when the "pwfeedback"
   sudoers option is enabled on systems with uni-directional pipes.

 * The "sudoedit_checkdir" option now treats a user-owned directory
   as writable, even if it does not have the write bit set at the
   time of check.  Symbolic links will no longer be followed by
   sudoedit in any user-owned directory.  Bug #912

 * Fixed sudoedit on macOS 10.15 and above where the root file system
   is mounted read-only.  Bug #913.

 * Fixed a crash introduced in sudo 1.8.30 when suspending sudo
   at the password prompt.  Bug #914.

 * Fixed compilation on systems where the mmap MAP_ANON flag
   is not available.  Bug #915.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.30

 * Fixed a warning on macOS introduced in sudo 1.8.29 when sudo
   attempts to set the open file limit to unlimited.  Bug #904.

 * Sudo now closes file descriptors before changing uids.  This
   prevents a non-root process from interfering with sudo's ability
   to close file descriptors on systems that support the prlimit(2)
   system call.

 * Sudo now treats an attempt to run "sudo sudoedit" as simply
   "sudoedit".  If the sudoers file contains a fully-qualified path
   to sudoedit, sudo will now treat it simply as "sudoedit" (with
   no path).  Visudo will will now treat a fully-qualified path
   to sudoedit as an error.  Bug #871.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.28 where sudo would warn about
   a missing /etc/environment file on AIX and Linux when PAM is not
   enabled.  Bug #907

 * Fixed a bug on Linux introduced in sudo 1.8.29 that prevented
   the askpass program from running due to an unlimited stack size
   resource limit.  Bug #908.

 * If a group provider plugin has optional arguments, the argument list
   passed to the plugin is now NULL terminated as per the documentation.

 * The user's time stamp file is now only updated if both authentication
   and approval phases succeed.  This is consistent with the behavior
   of sudo prior to version 1.8.23.  Bug #910

 * The new allow_unknown_runas_id sudoers setting can be used to
   enable or disable the use of unknown user or group IDs.  Previously,
   sudo would always allow unknown user or group IDs if the sudoers
   entry permitted it, including via the "ALL" alias.  As of sudo
   1.8.30, the admin must explicitly enable support for unknown IDs.

 * The new runas_check_shell sudoers setting can be used to require
   that the runas user have a shell listed in the /etc/shells file.
   On many systems, users such as "bin", do not have a valid shell
   and this flag can be used to prevent commands from being run as
   those users.

 * Fixed a problem restoring the SELinux tty context during reboot
   if mctransd is killed before sudo finishes.  GitHub issue #17.

 * Fixed an intermittent warning on NetBSD when sudo restores the
   initial stack size limit.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.29

 * The cvtsudoers command will now reject non-LDIF input when converting
   from LDIF format to sudoers or JSON formats.

 * The new log_allowed and log_denied sudoers settings make it possible
   to disable logging and auditing of allowed and/or denied commands.

 * The umask is now handled differently on systems with PAM or login.conf.
   If the umask is explicitly set in sudoers, that value is used regardless
   of what PAM or login.conf may specify.  However, if the umask is not
   explicitly set in sudoers, PAM or login.conf may now override the default
   sudoers umask.  Bug #900.

 * For "make install", the sudoers file is no longer checked for syntax
   errors when DESTDIR is set.  The default sudoers file includes the
   contents of /etc/sudoers.d which may not be readable as non-root.
   Bug #902.

 * Sudo now sets most resource limits to their maximum value to avoid
   problems caused by insufficient resources, such as an inability to
   allocate memory or open files and pipes.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.28 where sudo would refuse
   to run if the parent process was not associated with a session.
   This was due to sudo passing a session ID of -1 to the plugin.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.28p1

 * The fix for Bug #869 caused "sudo -v" to prompt for a password
   when "verifypw" is set to "all" (the default) and all of the
   user's sudoers entries are marked with NOPASSWD.  Bug #901.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.28

 * Sudo will now only set PAM_TTY to the empty string when no
   terminal is present on Solaris and Linux.  This workaround is
   only needed on those systems which may have PAM modules that
   misbehave when PAM_TTY is not set.

 * The mailerflags sudoers option now has a default value even if
   sendmail support was disabled at configure time.  Fixes a crash
   when the mailerpath sudoers option is set but mailerflags is not.
   Bug #878.

 * Sudo will now filter out last login messages on HP-UX unless it
   a shell is being run via "sudo -s" or "sudo -i".  Otherwise,
   when trusted mode is enabled, these messages will be displayed
   for each command.

 * On AIX, when the user's password has expired and PAM is not in use,
   sudo will now allow the user to change their password.
   Bug #883.

 * Sudo has a new -B command line option that will ring the terminal
   bell when prompting for a password.

 * Sudo no longer refuses to prompt for a password when it cannot
   determine the user's terminal as long as it can open /dev/tty.
   This allows sudo to function on systems where /proc is unavailable,
   such as when running in a chroot environment.

 * The "env_editor" sudoers flag is now on by default.  This makes
   source builds more consistent with the packages generated by
   sudo's mkpkg script.

 * Sudo no longer ships with pre-formatted copies of the manual pages.
   These were included for systems like IRIX that don't ship with an
   nroff utility.  There are now multiple Open Source nroff replacements
   so this should no longer be an issue.

 * Fixed a bad interaction with configure's --prefix and
   --disable-shared options.  Bug #886.

 * More verbose error message when a password is required and no terminal
   is present.  Bug #828.

 * Command tags, such as NOPASSWD, are honored when a user tries to run a
   command that is allowed by sudoers but which does not actually
   exist on the file system.  Bug #888.

 * Asturian translation for sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * I/O log timing files now store signal suspend and resume information
   in the form of a signal name instead of a number.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.24 that prevented sudo from honoring
   the value of "ipa_hostname" from sssd.conf, if specified, when
   matching the host name.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.21 that prevented the core dump
   resource limit set in the pam_limits module from taking effect.
   Bug #894.

 * Fixed parsing of double-quoted Defaults group and netgroup bindings.

 * The user ID is now used when matching sudoUser attributes in LDAP.
   Previously, the user name, group name and group IDs were used
   when matching but not the user ID.

 * Sudo now writes PAM messages to the user's terminal, if available,
   instead of the standard output or standard error.  This prevents
   PAM output from being intermixed with that of the command when
   output is sent to a file or pipe.  Bug #895.

 * Sudoedit now honors the umask and umask_override settings in sudoers.
   Previously, the user's umask was used as-is.

 * Fixed a bug where the terminal's file context was not restored
   when using SELinux RBAC.  Bug #898.

 * Fixed CVE-2019-14287, a bug where a sudo user may be able to
   run a command as root when the Runas specification explicitly
   disallows root access as long as the ALL keyword is listed first.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.27

 * On HP-UX, sudo will now update the utmps file when running a command
   in a pseudo-tty.  Previously, only the utmp and utmpx files were
   updated.

 * Nanosecond precision file time stamps are now supported in HP-UX.

 * Fixes and clarifications to the sudo plugin documentation.

 * The sudo manuals no longer require extensive post-processing to
   hide system-specific features.  Conditionals in the roff source
   are now used instead.  This fixes corruption of the sudo manual
   on systems without BSD login classes.  Bug #861.

 * If an I/O logging plugin is configured but the plugin does not
   actually log any I/O, sudo will no longer force the command to
   be run in a pseudo-tty.

 * The fix for bug #843 in sudo 1.8.24 was incomplete.  If the
   user's password was expired or needed to be updated, but no sudo
   password was required, the PAM handle was freed too early,
   resulting in a failure when processing PAM session modules.

 * In visudo, it is now possible to specify the path to sudoers
   without using the -f option.  Bug #864.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.22 where the utmp (or utmpx)
   file would not be updated when a command was run in a pseudo-tty.
   Bug #865.

 * Sudo now sets the silent flag when opening the PAM session except
   when running a shell via "sudo -s" or "sudo -i".  This prevents
   the pam_lastlog module from printing the last login information
   for each sudo command.  Bug #867.

 * Fixed the default AIX hard resource limit for the maximum number
   of files a user may have open.  If no hard limit for "nofiles"
   is explicitly set in /etc/security/limits, the default should
   be "unlimited".  Previously, the default hard limit was 8196.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.26

 * Fixed a bug in cvtsudoers when converting to JSON format when
   alias expansion is enabled. Bug #853.

 * Sudo no long sets the USERNAME environment variable when running
   commands. This is a non-standard environment variable that was
   set on some older Linux systems.

 * Sudo now treats the LOGNAME and USER environment variables (as
   well as the LOGIN variable on AIX) as a single unit.  If one is
   preserved or removed from the environment using env_keep, env_check
   or env_delete, so is the other.

 * Added support for OpenLDAP's TLS_REQCERT setting in ldap.conf.

 * Sudo now logs when the command was suspended and resumed in the
   I/O logs.  This information is used by sudoreplay to skip the
   time suspended when replaying the session unless the new -S flag
   is used.

 * Fixed documentation problems found by the igor utility.  Bug #854.

 * Sudo now prints a warning message when there is an error or end
   of file while reading the password instead of exiting silently.

 * Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end parsing the command_timeout,
   role, type, privs and limitprivs sudoOptions.  This also affected
   cvtsudoers conversion from LDIF to sudoers or JSON.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented timeout settings in sudoers from
   functioning unless a timeout was also specified on the command
   line.

 * Asturian translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * When generating LDIF output, cvtsudoers can now be configured
   to pad the sudoOrder increment such that the start order is used
   as a prefix.  Bug #856.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that prevented sudo from
   properly setting the user's groups on AIX.  Bug #857.

 * If the user specifies a group via sudo's -g option that matches
   any of the target user's groups, it is now allowed even if no
   groups are present in the Runas_Spec.  Previously, it was only
   allowed if it matched the target user's primary group.

 * The sudoers LDAP back-end now supports negated sudoRunAsUser and
   sudoRunAsGroup entries.

 * Sudo now provides a proper error message when the "fqdn" sudoers
   option is set and it is unable to resolve the local host name.
   Bug #859.

 * Portuguese translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Sudo now includes sudoers LDAP schema for the on-line configuration
   supported by OpenLDAP.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.25p1

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.25 that caused a crash on
   systems that have the poll() function but not the ppoll() function.
   Bug #851.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.25

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.20 that broke formatting of
   I/O log timing file entries on systems without a C99-compatible
   snprintf() function.  Our replacement snprintf() doesn't support
   floating point so we can't use the "%f" format directive.

 * I/O log timing file entries now use a monotonic timer and include
   nanosecond precision.  A monotonic timer that does not increment
   while the system is sleeping is used where available.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.24 where sudoNotAfter in the LDAP
   back-end was not being properly parsed.  Bug #845.

 * When sudo runs a command in a pseudo-terminal, the follower
   device is now closed in the main process immediately after
   starting the monitor process.  This removes the need for an
   AIX-specific workaround that was added in sudo 1.8.24.

 * Added support for monotonic timers on HP-UX.

 * Fixed a bug displaying timeout values the "sudo -V" output.
   The value displayed was 3600 times the actual value.  Bug #846.

 * Fixed a build issue on AIX 7.1 BOS levels that include memset_s()
   and define rsize_t in string.h.  Bug #847.

 * The testsudoers utility now supports querying an LDIF-format
   policy.

 * Sudo now sets the LOGIN environment variable to the same value as
   LOGNAME on AIX systems.  Bug #848.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.24 where the LDAP and
   SSSD back-ends evaluated the rules in reverse sudoOrder.  Bug #849.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.24

 * The LDAP and SSS back-ends now use the same rule evaluation code
   as the sudoers file back-end.  This builds on the work in sudo
   1.8.23 where the formatting functions for "sudo -l" output were
   shared.  The handling of negated commands in SSS and LDAP is
   unchanged.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in 1.8.23 where "sudo -i" could
   not be used in conjunction with --preserve-env=VARIABLE.  Bug #835.

 * cvtsudoers can now parse base64-encoded attributes in LDIF files.

 * Random insults are now more random.

 * Fixed the noexec wordexp(3) test on FreeBSD.

 * Added SUDO_CONV_PREFER_TTY flag for conversation function to
   tell sudo to try writing to /dev/tty first. Can be used in
   conjunction with SUDO_CONV_INFO_MSG and SUDO_CONV_ERROR_MSG.

 * Sudo now supports an arbitrary number of groups per user on
   Solaris.  Previously, only the first 64 groups were found.
   This should remove the need to set "max_groups" in sudo.conf.

 * Fixed typos in the OpenLDAP sudo schema.  Bugs #839 and #840.

 * Fixed a race condition when building with parallel make.
   Bug #842.

 * Fixed a duplicate free when netgroup_base in ldap.conf is set
   to an invalid value.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.23 on AIX that could prevent
   local users and groups from being resolved properly on systems
   that have users stored in NIS, LDAP or AD.

 * Added a workaround for an AIX bug exposed by a change in sudo
   1.8.23 that prevents the terminal mode from being restored when
   I/O logging is enabled.

 * On systems using PAM, sudo now ignores the PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD
   and PAM_AUTHTOK_EXPIRED errors from PAM account management if
   authentication is disabled for the user.  This fixes a regression
   introduced in sudo 1.8.23.  Bug #843.

 * Fixed an ambiguity in the sudoers manual in the description and
   definition of User, Runas, Host, and Cmnd Aliases.  Bug #834.

 * Fixed a bug that resulted in only the first window size change
   event being logged.

 * Fixed a bug on HP-UX systems introduced in sudo 1.8.22 that
   caused sudo to prompt for a password every time when tty-based
   time stamp files were in use.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on systems that define O_PATH or
   O_SEARCH in fnctl.h but do not define O_DIRECTORY.  Bug #844.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.23

 * PAM account management modules and BSD auth approval modules are
   now run even when no password is required.

 * For kernel-based time stamps, if no terminal is present, fall
   back to parent-pid style time stamps.

 * The new cvtsudoers utility replaces both the "sudoers2ldif" script
   and the "visudo -x" functionality.  It can read a file in either
   sudoers or LDIF format and produce JSON, LDIF or sudoers output.
   It is also possible to filter the generated output file by user,
   group or host name.

 * The file, ldap and sss sudoers back-ends now share a common set
   of formatting functions for "sudo -l" output, which is also used
   by the cvtsudoers utility.

 * The /run directory is now used in preference to /var/run if it
   exists. Bug #822.

 * More accurate descriptions of the --with-rundir and --with-vardir
   configure options.  Bug #823.

 * The setpassent() and setgroupent() functions are now used on systems
   that support them to keep the passwd and group database open.
   Sudo performs a lot of passwd and group lookups so it can be
   beneficial to avoid opening and closing the files each time.

 * The new case_insensitive_user and case_insensitive_group sudoers
   options can be used to control whether sudo does case-sensitive
   matching of users and groups in sudoers.  Case insensitive
   matching is now the default.

 * Fixed a bug on some systems where sudo could hang on command
   exit when I/O logging was enabled.  Bug #826.

 * Fixed the build-time process start time test on Linux when the
   test is run from within a container.  Bug #829.

 * When determining which temporary directory to use, sudoedit now
   checks the directory for writability before using it.  Previously,
   sudoedit only performed an existence check.  Bug #827.

 * Sudo now includes an optional set of Monty Python-inspired insults.

 * Fixed the execution of scripts with an associated digest (checksum)
   in sudoers on FreeBSD systems.  FreeBSD does not have a proper
   /dev/fd directory mounted by default and its fexecve(2) is not
   fully POSIX compliant when executing scripts.  Bug #831.

 * Chinese (Taiwan) translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.22

 * Commands run in the background from a script run via sudo will
   no longer receive SIGHUP when the parent exits and I/O logging
   is enabled.  Bug #502

 * A particularly offensive insult is now disabled by default.
   Bug #804

 * The description of "sudo -i" now correctly documents that
   the "env_keep" and "env_check" sudoers options are applied to
   the environment.  Bug #806

 * Fixed a crash when the system's host name is not set.
   Bug #807

 * The sudoers2ldif script now handles #include and #includedir
   directives.

 * Fixed a bug where sudo would silently exit when the command was
   not allowed by sudoers and the "passwd_tries" sudoers option
   was set to a value less than one.

 * Fixed a bug with the "listpw" and "verifypw" sudoers options and
   multiple sudoers sources.  If the option is set to "all", a
   password should be required unless none of a user's sudoers
   entries from any source require authentication.

 * Fixed a bug with the "listpw" and "verifypw" sudoers options in
   the LDAP and SSSD back-ends.  If the option is set to "any", and
   the entry contained multiple rules, only the first matching rule
   was checked.  If an entry contained more than one matching rule
   and the first rule required authentication but a subsequent rule
   did not, sudo would prompt for a password when it should not have.

 * When running a command as the invoking user (not root), sudo
   would execute the command with the same group vector it was
   started with.  Sudo now executes the command with a new group
   vector based on the group database which is consistent with
   how su(1) operates.

 * Fixed a double free in the SSSD back-end that could occur when
   ipa_hostname is present in sssd.conf and is set to an unqualified
   host name.

 * When I/O logging is enabled, sudo will now write to the terminal
   even when it is a background process.  Previously, sudo would
   only write to the tty when it was the foreground process when
   I/O logging was enabled.  If the TOSTOP terminal flag is set,
   sudo will suspend the command (and then itself) with the SIGTTOU
   signal.

 * A new "authfail_message" sudoers option that overrides the
   default "N incorrect password attempt(s)".

 * An empty sudoRunAsUser attribute in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends
   will now match the invoking user.  This is more consistent with
   how an empty runas user in the sudoers file is treated.

 * Documented that in check mode, visudo does not check the owner/mode
   on files specified with the -f flag.  Bug #809.

 * It is now an error to specify the runas user as an empty string
   on the command line.  Previously, an empty runas user was treated
   the same as an unspecified runas user.  Bug #817.

 * When "timestamp_type" option is set to "tty" and a terminal is
   present, the time stamp record will now include the start time
   of the session leader.  When the "timestamp_type" option is set
   to "ppid" or when no terminal is available, the start time of
   the parent process is used instead.  This significantly reduces
   the likelihood of a time stamp record being re-used when a user
   logs out and back in again.  Bug #818.

 * The sudoers time stamp file format is now documented in the new
   sudoers_timestamp manual.

 * The "timestamp_type" option now takes a "kernel" value on OpenBSD
   systems.  This causes the tty-based time stamp to be stored in
   the kernel instead of on the file system.  If no tty is present,
   the time stamp is considered to be invalid.

 * Visudo will now use the SUDO_EDITOR environment variable (if
   present) in addition to VISUAL and EDITOR.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.21p2

 * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which prevented sudo
   from using the PAM-supplied prompt.  Bug #799

 * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which could result in
   sudo hanging when running commands that exit quickly.  Bug #800

 * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.21 which prevented the
   command from being run when the password was read via an external
   program using the askpass interface.  Bug #801

What's new in Sudo 1.8.21p1

 * On systems that support both PAM and SIGINFO, the main sudo
   process will no longer forward SIGINFO to the command if the
   signal was generated from the keyboard.  The command will have
   already received SIGINFO since it is part of the same process
   group so there's no need for sudo to forward it.  This is
   consistent with the handling of SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTSTP.
   Bug #796

 * If SUDOERS_SEARCH_FILTER in ldap.conf does not specify a value,
   the LDAP search expression used when looking up netgroups and
   non-Unix groups had a syntax error if a group plugin was not
   specified.

 * "sudo -U otheruser -l" will now have an exit value of 0 even
   if "otheruser" has no sudo privileges.  The exit value when a
   user attempts to lists their own privileges or when a command
   is specified is unchanged.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.21 where sudoreplay
   playback would hang for I/O logs that contain terminal input.

 * Sudo 1.8.18 contained an incomplete fix for the matching of
   entries in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends when a sudoRunAsGroup is
   specified but no sudoRunAsUser is present in the sudoRole.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.21

 * The path that sudo uses to search for terminal devices can now
   be configured via the new "devsearch" Path setting in sudo.conf.

 * It is now possible to preserve bash shell functions in the
   environment when the "env_reset" sudoers setting is disabled by
   removing the "*=()*" pattern from the env_delete list.

 * A change made in sudo 1.8.15 inadvertently caused sudoedit to
   send itself SIGHUP instead of exiting when the editor returns
   an error or the file was not modified.

 * Sudoedit now uses an exit code of zero if the file was not
   actually modified.  Previously, sudoedit treated a lack of
   modifications as an error.

 * When running a command in a pseudo-tty (pty), sudo now copies a
   subset of the terminal flags to the new pty.  Previously, all
   flags were copied, even those not appropriate for a pty.

 * Fixed a problem with debug logging in the sudoers I/O logging
   plugin.

 * Window size change events are now logged to the policy plugin.
   On xterm and compatible terminals, sudoreplay is now capable of
   resizing the terminal to match the size of the terminal the
   command was run on.  The new -R option can be used to disable
   terminal resizing.

 * Fixed a bug in visudo where a newly added file was not checked
   for syntax errors.  Bug #791.

 * Fixed a bug in visudo where if a syntax error in an include
   directory (like /etc/sudoers.d) was detected, the edited version
   was left as a temporary file instead of being installed.

 * On PAM systems, sudo will now treat "username's Password:" as
   a standard password prompt.  As a result, the SUDO_PROMPT
   environment variable will now override "username's Password:"
   as well as the more common "Password:".  Previously, the
   "passprompt_override" Defaults setting would need to be set for
   SUDO_PROMPT to override a prompt of "username's Password:".

 * A new "syslog_pid" sudoers setting has been added to include
   sudo's process ID along with the process name when logging via
   syslog.  Bug #792.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.18 where a command would
   not be terminated when the I/O logging plugin returned an error
   to the sudo front-end.

 * A new "timestamp_type" sudoers setting has been added that replaces
   the "tty_tickets" option.  In addition to tty and global time stamp
   records, it is now possible to use the parent process ID to restrict
   the time stamp to commands run by the same process, usually the shell.
   Bug #793.

 * The --preserve-env command line option has been extended to accept
   a comma-separated list of environment variables to preserve.
   Bug #279.

 * Friulian translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.20p2

 * Fixed a bug parsing /proc/pid/stat on Linux when the process
   name contains newlines.  This is not exploitable due to the /dev
   traversal changes in sudo 1.8.20p1.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.20p1

 * Fixed "make check" when using OpenSSL or GNU crypt.
   Bug #787.

 * Fixed CVE-2017-1000367, a bug parsing /proc/pid/stat on Linux
   when the process name contains spaces.  Since the user has control
   over the command name, this could potentially be used by a user
   with sudo access to overwrite an arbitrary file on systems with
   SELinux enabled.  Also stop performing a breadth-first traversal
   of /dev when looking for the device; only a hard-coded list of
   directories are checked,

What's new in Sudo 1.8.20

 * Added support for SASL_MECH in ldap.conf. Bug #764

 * Added support for digest matching when the command is a glob-style
   pattern or a directory. Previously, only explicit path matches
   supported digest checks.

 * New "fdexec" Defaults option to control whether a command
   is executed by path or by open file descriptor.

 * The embedded copy of zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.11.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented sudoers include files with a relative
   path starting with the letter 'i' from being opened.  Bug #776.

 * Added support for command timeouts in sudoers.  The command will
   be terminated if the timeout expires.

 * The SELinux role and type are now displayed in the "sudo -l"
   output for the LDAP and SSSD back-ends, just as they are in the
   sudoers back-end.

 * A new command line option, -T, can be used to specify a command
   timeout as long as the user-specified timeout is not longer than
   the timeout specified in sudoers.  This option may only be
   used when the "user_command_timeouts" flag is enabled in sudoers.

 * Added NOTBEFORE and NOTAFTER command options to the sudoers
   back-end similar to what is already available in the LDAP back-end.

 * Sudo can now optionally use the SHA2 functions in OpenSSL or GNU
   crypt instead of the SHA2 implementation bundled with sudo.

 * Fixed a compilation error on systems without the stdbool.h header
   file.  Bug #778.

 * Fixed a compilation error in the standalone Kerberos V authentication
   module.  Bug #777.

 * Added the iolog_flush flag to sudoers which causes I/O log data
   to be written immediately to disk instead of being buffered.

 * I/O log files are now created with group ID 0 by default unless
   the "iolog_user" or "iolog_group" options are set in sudoers.

 * It is now possible to store I/O log files on an NFS-mounted
   file system where uid 0 is remapped to an unprivileged user.
   The "iolog_user" option must be set to a non-root user and the
   top-level I/O log directory must exist and be owned by that user.

 * Added the restricted_env_file setting to sudoers which is similar
   to env_file but its contents are subject to the same restrictions
   as variables in the invoking user's environment.

 * Fixed a use after free bug in the SSSD back-end when the fqdn
   sudoOption is enabled and no hostname value is present in
   /etc/sssd/sssd.conf.

 * Fixed a typo that resulted in a compilation error on systems
   where the killpg() function is not found by configure.

 * Fixed a compilation error with the included version of zlib
   when sudo was built outside the source tree.

 * Fixed the exit value of sudo when the command is terminated by
   a signal other than SIGINT.  This was broken in sudo 1.8.15 by
   the fix for Bug #722.  Bug #784.

 * Fixed a regression introduced in sudo 1.8.18 where the "lecture"
   option could not be used in a positive boolean context, only
   a negative one.

 * Fixed an issue where sudo would consume stdin if it was not
   connected to a tty even if log_input is not enabled in sudoers.
   Bug #786.

 * Clarify in the sudoers manual that the #includedir directive
   diverts control to the files in the specified directory and,
   when parsing of those files is complete, returns control to the
   original file.  Bug #775.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.19p2

 * Fixed a crash in visudo introduced in sudo 1.8.9 when an IP address
   or network is used in a host-based Defaults entry.  Bug #766

 * Added a missing check for the ignore_iolog_errors flag when
   the sudoers plugin generates the I/O log file path name.

 * Fixed a typo in sudo's vsyslog() replacement that resulted in
   garbage being logged to syslog.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.19p1

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.19 that resulted in the wrong
   syslog priority and facility being used.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.19

 * New "syslog_maxlen" Defaults option to control the maximum size of
   syslog messages generated by sudo.

 * Sudo has been run against PVS-Studio and any issues that were
   not false positives have been addressed.

 * I/O log files are now created with the same group ID as the
   parent directory and not the invoking user's group ID.

 * I/O log permissions and ownership are now configurable via the
   "iolog_mode", "iolog_user" and "iolog_group" sudoers Defaults
   variables.

 * Fixed configuration of the sudoers I/O log plugin debug subsystem.
   Previously, I/O log information was not being written to the
   sudoers debug log.

 * Fixed a bug in visudo that broke editing of files in an include
   dir that have a syntax error.  Normally, visudo does not edit
   those files, but if a syntax error is detected in one, the user
   should get a chance to fix it.

 * Warnings about unknown or unparsable sudoers Defaults entries now
   include the file and line number of the problem.

 * Visudo will now use the file and line number information about an
   unknown or unparsable Defaults entry to go directly to the file
   with the problem.

 * Fixed a bug in the sudoers LDAP back-end where a negated sudoHost
   entry would prevent other sudoHost entries following it from matching.

 * Warnings from visudo about a cycle in an Alias entry now include the
   file and line number of the problem.

 * In strict mode, visudo will now use the file and line number
   information about a cycle in an Alias entry to go directly to the
   file with the problem.

 * The sudo_noexec.so file is now linked with -ldl on systems that
   require it for the wordexp() wrapper.

 * Fixed linking of sudo_noexec.so on macOS systems where it must be
   a dynamic library and not a module.

 * Sudo's "make check" now includes a test for sudo_noexec.so
   working.

 * The sudo front-end now passes the user's umask to the plugin.
   Previously the plugin had to determine this itself.

 * Sudoreplay can now display the stdin and ttyin streams when they
   are explicitly added to the filter list.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.17 where the "all" setting
   for verifypw and listpw was not being honored.  Bug #762.

 * The syslog priority (syslog_goodpri and syslog_badpri) can now
   be negated or set to "none" to disable logging of successful or
   unsuccessful sudo attempts via syslog.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.18p1

 * When sudo_noexec.so is used, the WRDE_NOCMD flag is now added
   if the wordexp() function is called.  This prevents commands
   from being run via wordexp() without disabling it entirely.

 * On Linux systems, sudo_noexec.so now uses a seccomp filter to
   disable execute access if the kernel supports seccomp.  This is
   more robust than the traditional method of using stub functions
   that return an error.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.18

 * The sudoers locale is now set before parsing the sudoers file.
   If sudoers_locale is set in sudoers, it is applied before
   evaluating other Defaults entries.  Previously, sudoers_locale
   was used when evaluating sudoers but not during the initial parse.
   Bug #748.

 * A missing or otherwise invalid #includedir is now ignored instead
   of causing a parse error.

 * During "make install", backup files are only used on HP-UX where
   it is not possible to unlink a shared object that is in use.
   This works around a bug in ldconfig on Linux which could create
   links to the backup shared library file instead of the current
   one.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where sudoers entries with long
   commands lines could be truncated, preventing a match.  Bug #752.

 * The fqdn, runas_default and sudoers_locale Defaults settings are
   now applied before any other Defaults settings since they can
   change how other Defaults settings are parsed.

 * On systems without the O_NOFOLLOW open(2) flag, when the NOFOLLOW
   flag is set, sudoedit now checks whether the file is a symbolic link
   before opening it as well as after the open.  Bug #753.

 * Sudo will now only resolve a user's group IDs to group names
   when sudoers includes group-based permissions.  Group lookups
   can be expensive on some systems where the group database is
   not local.

 * If the file system holding the sudo log file is full, allow
   the command to run unless the new ignore_logfile_errors Defaults
   option is disabled.  Bug #751.

 * The ignore_audit_errors and ignore_iolog_errors Defaults options
   have been added to control sudo's behavior when it is unable to
   write to the audit and I/O logs.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where the SIGPIPE signal handler
   was not being restored when sudo directly executes the command.

 * Fixed a bug where "sudo -l command" would indicate that a command
   was runnable even when denied by sudoers when using the LDAP or
   SSSD back-ends.

 * The match_group_by_gid Defaults option has been added to allow
   sites where group name resolution is slow and where sudoers only
   contains a small number of groups to match groups by group ID
   instead of by group name.

 * Fixed a bug on Linux where a 32-bit sudo binary could fail with
   an "unable to allocate memory" error when run on a 64-bit system.
   Bug #755

 * When parsing ldap.conf, sudo will now only treat a '#' character
   as the start of a comment when it is at the beginning of the
   line.

 * Fixed a potential crash when auditing is enabled and the audit
   function fails with an error.  Bug #756

 * Norwegian Nynorsk translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * Fixed a typo that broke short host name matching when the fqdn
   flag is enabled in sudoers.  Bug #757

 * Negated sudoHost attributes are now supported by the LDAP and
   SSSD back-ends.

 * Fixed matching entries in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends when a
   RunAsGroup is specified but no RunAsUser is present.

 * Fixed "sudo -l" output in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends when a
   RunAsGroup is specified but no RunAsUser is present.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.17p1

 * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8.17 where the user's groups were
   not set on systems that don't use PAM.  Bug #749.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.17

 * On AIX, if /etc/security/login.cfg has auth_type set to PAM_AUTH
   but pam_start(3) fails, fall back to AIX authentication.
   Bug #740.

 * Sudo now takes all sudoers sources into account when determining
   whether or not "sudo -l" or "sudo -v" should prompt for a password.
   In other words, if both file and ldap sudoers sources are in
   specified in /etc/nsswitch.conf, "sudo -v" will now require that
   all entries in both sources be have NOPASSWD (file) or !authenticate
   (ldap) in the entries.

 * Sudo now ignores SIGPIPE until the command is executed.  Previously,
   SIGPIPE was only ignored in a few select places.  Bug #739.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 where (non-syslog) log
   file entries were missing the newline when loglinelen is set to
   a non-positive number.  Bug #742.

 * Unix groups are now set before the plugin session initialization
   code is run.  This makes it possible to use dynamic groups with
   the Linux-PAM pam_group module.

 * Fixed a bug where a debugging statement could dereference a NULL
   pointer when looking up a group that doesn't exist.  Bug #743.

 * Sudo has been run through the Coverity code scanner.  A number of
   minor bugs have been fixed as a result.  None were security issues.

 * SELinux support, which was broken in 1.8.16, has been repaired.

 * Fixed a bug when logging I/O where all output buffers might not
   get flushed at exit.

 * Forward slashes are no longer escaped in the JSON output of
   "visudo -x".  This was never required by the standard and not
   escaping them improves readability of the output.

 * Sudo no longer treats PAM_SESSION_ERR as a fatal error when
   opening the PAM session.  Other errors from pam_open_session()
   are still treated as fatal.  This avoids the "policy plugin
   failed session initialization" error message seen on some systems.

 * Korean translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Fixed a bug on AIX where the stack size hard resource limit was
   being set to 2GB instead of 4GB on 64-bit systems.

 * The SSSD back-end now properly supports "sudo -U otheruser -l".

 * The SSSD back-end now uses the value of "ipa_hostname"
   from sssd.conf, if specified, when matching the host name.

 * Fixed a hang on some systems when the command is being run in
   a pty and it failed to execute.

 * When performing a wildcard match in sudoers, check for an exact
   string match if the user command was fully-qualified (or resolved
   via the PATH).  This fixes an issue executing scripts on Linux
   when there are multiple wildcard matches with the same base name.
   Bug #746.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.16

 * Fixed a compilation error on Solaris 10 with Stun Studio 12.
   Bug #727.

 * When preserving variables from the invoking user's environment, if
   there are duplicates sudo now only keeps the first instance.

 * Fixed a bug that could cause warning mail to be sent in list
   mode (sudo -l) for users without sudo privileges when the
   LDAP and sssd back-ends are used.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented the "mail_no_user" option from working
   properly with the LDAP back-end.

 * In the LDAP and sssd back-ends, white space is now ignored between
   an operator (!, +, +=, -=) when parsing a sudoOption.

 * It is now possible to disable Path settings in sudo.conf
   by omitting the path name.

 * The sudoedit_checkdir Defaults option is now enabled by default
   and has been extended.  When editing files with sudoedit, each
   directory in the path to be edited is now checked.  If a directory
   is writable by the invoking user, symbolic links will not be
   followed.  If the parent directory of the file to be edited is
   writable, sudoedit will refuse to edit it.
   Bug #707.

 * The netgroup_tuple Defaults option has been added to enable matching
   of the entire netgroup tuple, not just the host or user portion.
   Bug #717.

 * When matching commands based on the SHA2 digest, sudo will now
   use fexecve(2) to execute the command if it is available.  This
   fixes a time of check versus time of use race condition when the
   directory holding the command is writable by the invoking user.

 * On AIX systems, sudo now caches the auth registry string along
   with password and group information.  This fixes a potential
   problem when a user or group of the same name exists in multiple
   auth registries.  For example, local and LDAP.

 * Fixed a crash in the SSSD back-end when the invoking user is not
   found.  Bug #732.

 * Added the --enable-asan configure flag to enable address sanitizer
   support.  A few minor memory leaks have been plugged to quiet
   the ASAN leak detector.

 * The value of _PATH_SUDO_CONF may once again be overridden via
   the Makefile.  Bug #735.

 * The sudoers2ldif script now handles multiple roles with same name.

 * Fixed a compilation error on systems that have the posix_spawn()
   and posix_spawnp() functions but an unusable spawn.h header.
   Bug #730.

 * Fixed support for negating character classes in sudo's version
   of the fnmatch() function.

 * Fixed a bug in the LDAP and SSSD back-ends that could allow an
   unauthorized user to list another user's privileges.  Bug #738.

 * The PAM conversation function now works around an ambiguity in the
   PAM spec with respect to multiple messages.  Bug #726.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.15

 * Fixed a bug that prevented sudo from building outside the source tree
   on some platforms.  Bug #708.

 * Fixed the location of the sssd library in the RHEL/Centos packages.
   Bug #710.

 * Fixed a build problem on systems that don't implicitly include
   sys/types.h from other header files.  Bug #711.

 * Fixed a problem on Linux using containers where sudo would ignore
   signals sent by a process in a different container.

 * Sudo now refuses to run a command if the PAM session module
   returns an error.

 * When editing files with sudoedit, symbolic links will no longer
   be followed by default.  The old behavior can be restored by
   enabling the sudoedit_follow option in sudoers or on a per-command
   basis with the FOLLOW and NOFOLLOW tags.  Bug #707.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in version 1.8.14 that caused the last
   valid editor in the sudoers "editor" list to be used by visudo
   and sudoedit instead of the first.  Bug #714.

 * Fixed a bug in visudo that prevented the addition of a final
   newline to edited files without one.

 * Fixed a bug decoding certain base64 digests in sudoers when the
   intermediate format included a '=' character.

 * Individual records are now locked in the time stamp file instead
   of the entire file.  This allows sudo to avoid prompting for a
   password multiple times on the same terminal when used in a
   pipeline.  In other words, "sudo cat foo | sudo grep bar" now
   only prompts for the password once.  Previously, both sudo
   processes would prompt for a password, often making it impossible
   to enter.

 * Fixed a bug where sudo would fail to run commands as a non-root
   user on systems that lack both setresuid() and setreuid().
   Bug #713.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented visudo from
   re-editing the correct file when a syntax error was detected.

 * Fixed a bug where sudo would not relay a SIGHUP signal to the
   command when the terminal is closed and the command is not run
   in its own pseudo-tty.  Bug #719

 * If some, but not all, of the LOGNAME, USER or USERNAME environment
   variables have been preserved from the invoking user's environment,
   sudo will now use the preserved value to set the remaining variables
   instead of using the runas user.  This ensures that if, for example,
   only LOGNAME is present in the env_keep list, that sudo will not
   set USER and USERNAME to the runas user.

*  When the command sudo is running dies due to a signal, sudo will
   now send itself that same signal with the default signal handler
   installed instead of exiting.  The bash shell appears to ignore
   some signals, e.g. SIGINT, unless the command being run is killed
   by that signal.  This makes the behavior of commands run under
   sudo the same as without sudo when bash is the shell.  Bug #722

 * Slovak translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * Hungarian and Slovak translations for sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Previously, when env_reset was enabled (the default) and the -s
   option was not used, the SHELL environment variable was set to the
   shell of the invoking user.  Now, when env_reset is enabled and
   the -s option is not used, SHELL is set based on the target user.

 * Fixed challenge/response style BSD authentication.

 * Added the sudoedit_checkdir Defaults option to prevent sudoedit
   from editing files located in a directory that is writable by
   the invoking user.

 * Added the always_query_group_plugin Defaults option to control
   whether groups not found in the system group database are passed
   to the group plugin.  Previously, unknown system groups were
   always passed to the group plugin.

 * When creating a new file, sudoedit will now check that the file's
   parent directory exists before running the editor.

 * Fixed the compiler stack protector test in configure for compilers
   that support -fstack-protector but don't actually have the ssp
   library available.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.14p3

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14p2 that prevented sudo
   from working when no tty was present.

 * Fixed tty detection on newer AIX systems where dev_t is 64-bit.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.14p2

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented the lecture
   file from being created.  Bug #704.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.14p1

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.14 that prevented the sssd
   back-end from working.  Bug #703.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.14

 * Log messages on Mac OS X now respect sudoers_locale when sudo
   is build with NLS support.

 * The sudo manual pages now pass "mandoc -Tlint" with no warnings.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on systems with the sig2str() function
   that do not define SIG2STR_MAX in signal.h.

 * Worked around a compiler bug that resulted in unexpected behavior
   when returning an int from a function declared to return bool
   without an explicit cast.

 * Worked around a bug in Mac OS X 10.10 BSD auditing where the
   au_preselect() fails for AUE_sudo events but succeeds for
   AUE_DARWIN_sudo.

 * Fixed a hang on Linux systems with glibc when sudo is linked with
   jemalloc.

 * When the user runs a command as a user ID that is not present in
   the password database via the -u flag, the command is now run
   with the group ID of the invoking user instead of group ID 0.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on systems that don't pull in
   definitions of uid_t and gid_t without sys/types.h or unistd.h.

 * Fixed a compilation problem on newer AIX systems which use a
   struct st_timespec for time stamps in struct stat that differs
   from struct timespec.  Bug #702.

 * The example directory is now configurable via --with-exampledir
   and defaults to DATAROOTDIR/examples/sudo on BSD systems.

 * The /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/sudo.conf file is now installed as part
   of "make install" when systemd is in use.

 * Fixed a linker problem on some systems with libintl.  Bug #690.

 * Fixed compilation with compilers that don't support __func__
   or __FUNCTION__.

 * Sudo no longer needs to uses weak symbols to support localization
   in the warning functions.  A registration function is used instead.

 * Fixed a setresuid() failure in sudoers on Linux kernels where
   uid changes take the nproc resource limit into account.

 * Fixed LDAP netgroup queries on AIX.

 * Sudo will now display the custom prompt on Linux systems with PAM
   even if the "Password: " prompt is not localized by the PAM module.
   Bug #701.

 * Double-quoted values in an LDAP sudoOption are now supported
   for consistency with file-based sudoers.

 * Fixed a bug that prevented the btime entry in /proc/stat from
   being parsed on Linux.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.13

 * The examples directory is now a subdirectory of the doc dir to
   conform to Debian guidelines.  Bug #682.

 * Fixed a compilation error for siglist.c and signame.c on some
   systems.  Bug #686

 * Weak symbols are now used for sudo_warn_gettext() and
   sudo_warn_strerror() in libsudo_util to avoid link errors when
   -Wl,--no-undefined is used in LDFLAGS.  The --disable-weak-symbols
   configure option can be used to disable the user of weak symbols.

 * Fixed a bug in sudo's mkstemps() replacement function that
   prevented the file extension from being preserved in sudoedit.

 * A new mail_all_cmnds sudoers flag will send mail when a user runs
   a command (or tries to). The behavior of the mail_always flag has
   been restored to always send mail when sudo is run.

 * New "MAIL" and "NOMAIL" command tags have been added to toggle
   mail sending behavior on a per-command (or Cmnd_Alias) basis.

 * Fixed matching of empty passwords when sudo is configured to
   use passwd (or shadow) file authentication on systems where the
   crypt() function returns NULL for invalid salts.

 * On AIX, sudo now uses the value of the auth_type setting in
   /etc/security/login.cfg to determine whether to use LAM or PAM
   for user authentication.

 * The "all" setting for listpw and verifypw now works correctly
   with LDAP and sssd sudoers.

 * The sudo timestamp directory is now created at boot time on
   platforms that use systemd.

 * Sudo will now restore the value of the SIGPIPE handler before
   executing the command.

 * Sudo now uses "struct timespec" instead of "struct timeval" for
   time keeping when possible.  If supported, sudoedit and visudo
   now use nanosecond granularity time stamps.

 * Fixed a symbol name collision with systems that have their own
   SHA2 implementation.  This fixes a problem where PAM could use
   the wrong SHA2 implementation on Solaris 10 systems configured
   to use SHA512 for passwords.

 * The editor invoked by sudoedit once again uses an unmodified
   copy of the user's environment as per the documentation.  This
   was inadvertently changed in sudo 1.8.0.  Bug #688.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.12

 * The embedded copy of zlib has been upgraded to version 1.2.8 and
   is now installed as a shared library where supported.

 * Debug settings for the sudo front end and sudoers plugin are now
   configured separately.

 * Multiple sudo.conf Debug entries may now be specified per program
   (or plugin).

 * The plugin API has been extended such that the path to the plugin
   that was loaded is now included in the settings array.  This
   path can be used to register with the debugging subsystem.  The
   debug_flags setting is now prefixed with a file name and may be
   specified multiple times if there is more than one matching Debug
   setting in sudo.conf.

 * The sudoers regression tests now run with the locale set to C
   since some of the tests compare output that includes locale-specific
   messages.  Bug #672

 * Fixed a bug where sudo would not run commands on Linux when
   compiled with audit support if audit is disabled.  Bug #671

 * Added __BASH_FUNC<* to the environment blacklist to match
   Apple's syntax for newer-style bash functions.

 * The default password prompt now includes a trailing space after
   "Password:" for consistency with su(1) on most systems.
   Bug #663

 * Fixed a problem on DragonFly BSD where SIGCHLD could be ignored,
   preventing sudo from exiting.  Bug #676

 * Visudo will now use the optional sudoers_file, sudoers_mode,
   sudoers_uid and sudoers_gid arguments if specified on the
   sudoers.so Plugin line in the sudo.conf file.

 * Fixed a problem introduced in sudo 1.8.8 that prevented the full
   host name from being used when the "fqdn" sudoers option is used.
   Bug #678

 * French and Russian translations for sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Sudo now installs a handler for SIGCHLD signal handler immediately
   before stating the process that will execute the command (or
   start the monitor).  The handler used to be installed earlier
   but this causes problems with poorly behaved PAM modules that
   install their own SIGCHLD signal handler and neglect to restore
   sudo's original handler.  Bug #657

 * Removed a limit on the length of command line arguments expanded
   by a wild card using sudo's version of the fnmatch() function.
   This limit was introduced when sudo's version of fnmatch()
   was replaced in sudo 1.8.4.

 * LDAP-based sudoers can now query an LDAP server for a user's
   netgroups directly.  This is often much faster than fetching
   every sudoRole object containing a sudoUser that begins with a
   `+' prefix and checking whether the user is a member of any of
   the returned netgroups.

 * The mail_always sudoers option no longer sends mail for "sudo -l"
   or "sudo -v" unless the user is unable to authenticate themselves.

 * Fixed a crash when sudo is run with an empty argument vector.

 * Fixed two potential crashes when sudo is run with very low
   resource limits.

 * The TZ environment variable is now checked for safety instead
   of simply being copied to the environment of the command.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.11p2

 * Fixed a bug where dynamic shared objects loaded from a plugin
   could use the hooked version of getenv() but not the hooked
   versions of putenv(), setenv() or unsetenv().  This can cause
   problems for PAM modules that use those functions.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.11p1

 * Fixed a compilation problem on some systems when the
   --disable-shared-libutil configure option was specified.

 * The user can no longer interrupt the sleep after an incorrect
   password on PAM systems using pam_unix.
   Bug #666

 * Fixed a compilation problem on Linux systems that do not use PAM.
   Bug #667

 * "make install" will now work with the stock GNU autotools
   install-sh script.  Bug #669

 * Fixed a crash with "sudo -i" when the current working directory
   does not exist.  Bug #670

 * Fixed a potential crash in the debug subsystem when logging a message
   larger that 1024 bytes.

 * Fixed a "make check" failure for ttyname when stdin is closed and
   stdout and stderr are redirected to a different tty.  Bug #643

 * Added BASH_FUNC_* to the environment blacklist to match newer-style
   bash functions.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.11

 * The sudoers plugin no longer uses setjmp/longjmp to recover
   from fatal errors.  All errors are now propagated to the caller
   via return codes.

 * When running a command in the background, sudo will now forward
   SIGINFO to the command (if supported).

 * Sudo will now use the system versions of the sha2 functions from
   libc or libmd if available.

 * Visudo now works correctly on GNU Hurd.  Bug #647

 * Fixed suspend and resume of curses programs on some system when
   the command is not being run in a pseudo-terminal.  Bug #649

 * Fixed a crash with LDAP-based sudoers on some systems when
   Kerberos was enabled.

 * Sudo now includes optional Solaris audit support.

 * Catalan translation for sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Norwegian Bokmaal translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * Greek translation for sudoers from translationproject.org

 * The sudo source tree has been reorganized to more closely resemble
   that of other gettext-enabled packages.

 * Sudo and its associated programs now link against a shared version
   of libsudo_util.  The --disable-shared-libutil configure option
   may be used to force static linking if the --enable-static-sudoers
   option is also specified.

 * The passwords in ldap.conf and ldap.secret may now be encoded
   in base64.

 * Audit updates.  SELinux role changes are now audited.  For
   sudoedit, we now audit the actual editor being run, instead of
   just the sudoedit command.

 * Fixed bugs in the man page post-processing that could cause
   portions of the manuals to be removed.

 * Fixed a crash in the system_group plugin.  Bug #653.

 * Fixed sudoedit on platforms without a system version of the
   getprogname() function.  Bug #654.

 * Fixed compilation problems with some pre-C99 compilers.

 * Fixed sudo's -C option which was broken in version 1.8.9.

 * It is now possible to match an environment variable's value as
   well as its name using env_keep and env_check.  This can be used
   to preserve bash functions which would otherwise be removed from
   the environment.

 * New files created via sudoedit as a non-root user now have the
   proper group id.  Bug #656

 * Sudoedit now works correctly in conjunction with sudo's SELinux
   RBAC support.  Temporary files are now created with the proper
   security context.

 * The sudo I/O logging plugin API has been updated.  If a logging
   function returns an error, the command will be terminated and
   all of the plugin's logging functions will be disabled.  If a
   logging function rejects the command's output it will no longer
   be displayed to the user's terminal.

 * Fixed a compilation error on systems that lack openpty(), _getpty()
   and grantpt(). Bug #660

 * Fixed a hang when a sudoers source is listed more than once in
   a single sudoers nsswitch.conf entry.

 * On AIX, shell scripts without a #! magic number are now passed to
   /usr/bin/sh, not /usr/bin/bsh.  This is consistent with what the
   execvp() function on AIX does and matches historic sudo behavior.
   Bug #661

 * Fixed a cross-compilation problem building mksiglist and mksigname.
   Bug #662

What's new in Sudo 1.8.10p3?

 * Fixed expansion of %p in the prompt for "sudo -l" when rootpw,
   runaspw or targetpw is set.  Bug #639

 * Fixed matching of UIDs and GIDs which was broken in version 1.8.9.
   Bug #640

 * PAM credential initialization has been re-enabled.  It was
   unintentionally disabled by default in version 1.8.8.  The way
   credentials are initialized has also been fixed.  Bug #642.

 * Fixed a descriptor leak on Linux when determining boot time.  Sudo
   normally closes extra descriptors before running a command so
   the impact is limited.  Bug #645

 * Fixed flushing of the last buffer of data when I/O logging is
   enabled.  This bug, introduced in version 1.8.9, could cause
   incomplete command output on some systems.  Bug #646

What's new in Sudo 1.8.10p2?

 * Fixed a hang introduced in sudo 1.8.10 when timestamp_timeout
   is set to zero.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.10p1?

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.10 that prevented the disabling
   of tty-based tickets.

 * Fixed a bug with negated commands in "sudo -l command" that
   could cause the command to be listed even when it was explicitly
   denied.  This only affected list mode when a command was specified.
   Bug #636

What's new in Sudo 1.8.10?

 * It is now possible to disable network interface probing in
   sudo.conf by changing the value of the probe_interfaces
   setting.

 * When listing a user's privileges (sudo -l), the sudoers plugin
   will now prompt for the user's password even if the targetpw,
   rootpw or runaspw options are set.

 * The sudoers plugin uses a new format for its time stamp files.
   Each user now has a single file which may contain multiple records
   when per-tty time stamps are in use (the default).  The time
   stamps use a monotonic timer where available and are once again
   located in a directory under /var/run.  The lecture status is
   now stored separately from the time stamps in a different directory.
   Bug #616

 * sudo's -K option will now remove all of the user's time stamps,
   not just the time stamp for the current terminal.  The -k option
   can be used to only disable time stamps for the current terminal.

 * If sudo was started in the background and needed to prompt for
   a password, it was not possible to suspend it at the password
   prompt.  This now works properly.

 * LDAP-based sudoers now uses a default search filter of
   (objectClass=sudoRole) for more efficient queries.  The netgroup
   query has been modified to avoid falling below the minimum length
   for OpenLDAP substring indices.

 * The new "use_netgroups" sudoers option can be used to explicitly
   enable or disable netgroups support.  For LDAP-based sudoers,
   netgroup support requires an expensive substring match on the
   server.  If netgroups are not needed, this option can be disabled
   to reduce the load on the LDAP server.

 * Sudo is once again able to open the sudoers file when the group
   on sudoers doesn't match the expected value, so long as the file
   is not group writable.

 * Sudo now installs an init.d script to clear the time stamp
   directory at boot time on AIX and HP-UX systems.  These systems
   either lack /var/run or do not clear it on boot.

 * The JSON format used by "visudo -x" now properly supports the
   negation operator.  In addition, the Options object is now the
   same for both Defaults and Cmnd_Specs.

 * Czech and Serbian translations for sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Catalan translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.9p5?

 * Fixed a compilation error on AIX when LDAP support is enabled.

 * Fixed parsing of the "umask" defaults setting in sudoers.  Bug #632.

 * Fixed a failed assertion when the "closefrom_override" defaults
   setting is enabled in sudoers and sudo's -C flag is used.  Bug #633.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.9p4?

 * Fixed a bug where sudo could consume large amounts of CPU while
   the command was running when I/O logging is not enabled.  Bug #631

 * Fixed a bug where sudo would exit with an error when the debug
   level is set to util@debug or all@debug and I/O logging is not
   enabled.  The command would continue running after sudo exited.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.9p3?

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.9 that prevented the tty name
   from being resolved properly on Linux systems.  Bug #630.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.9p2?

 * Updated config.guess, config.sub and libtool to support the ppc64le
   architecture (IBM PowerPC Little Endian).

What's new in Sudo 1.8.9p1?

 * Fixed a problem with gcc 4.8's handling of bit fields that could
   lead to the noexec flag being enabled even when it was not
   explicitly set.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.9?

 * Reworked sudo's main event loop to use a simple event subsystem
   using poll(2) or select(2) as the back end.

 * It is now possible to statically compile the sudoers plugin into
   the sudo binary without disabling shared library support.  The
   sudo.conf file may still be used to configure other plugins.

 * Sudo can now be compiled again with a C preprocessor that does
   not support variadic macros.

 * Visudo can now export a sudoers file in JSON format using the
   new -x flag.

 * The locale is now set correctly again for visudo and sudoreplay.

 * The plugin API has been extended to allow the plugin to exclude
   specific file descriptors from the "closefrom" range.

 * There is now a workaround for a Solaris-specific problem where
   NOEXEC was overriding traditional root DAC behavior.

 * Add user netgroup filtering for SSSD. Previously, rules for
   a netgroup were applied to all even when they did not belong
   to the specified netgroup.

 * On systems with BSD login classes, if the user specified a group
   (not a user) to run the command as, it was possible to specify
   a different login class even when the command was not run as the
   super user.

 * The closefrom() emulation on Mac OS X now uses /dev/fd if possible.

 * Fixed a bug where sudoedit would not update the original file
   from the temporary when PAM or I/O logging is not enabled.

 * When recycling I/O logs, the log files are now truncated properly.

 * Fixes bugs #617, #621, #622, #623, #624, #625, #626

What's new in Sudo 1.8.8?

 * Removed a warning on PAM systems with stacked auth modules
   where the first module on the stack does not succeed.

 * Sudo, sudoreplay and visudo now support GNU-style long options.

 * The -h (--host) option may now be used to specify a host name.
   This is currently only used by the sudoers plugin in conjunction
   with the -l (--list) option.

 * Program usage messages and manual SYNOPSIS sections have been
   simplified.

 * Sudo's LDAP SASL support now works properly with Kerberos.
   Previously, the SASL library was unable to locate the user's
   credential cache.

 * It is now possible to set the nproc resource limit to unlimited
   via pam_limits on Linux (bug #565).

 * New "pam_service" and "pam_login_service" sudoers options
   that can be used to specify the PAM service name to use.

 * New "pam_session" and "pam_setcred" sudoers options that
   can be used to disable PAM session and credential support.

 * The sudoers plugin now properly supports UIDs and GIDs
   that are larger than 0x7fffffff on 32-bit platforms.

 * Fixed a visudo bug introduced in sudo 1.8.7 where per-group
   Defaults entries would cause an internal error.

 * If the "tty_tickets" sudoers option is enabled (the default),
   but there is no tty present, sudo will now use a ticket file
   based on the parent process ID.  This makes it possible to support
   the normal timeout behavior for the session.

 * Fixed a problem running commands that change their process
   group and then attempt to change the terminal settings when not
   running the command in a pseudo-terminal.  Previously, the process
   would receive SIGTTOU since it was effectively a background
   process.  Sudo will now grant the child the controlling tty and
   continue it when this happens.

 * The "closefrom_override" sudoers option may now be used in
   a command-specified Defaults entry (bug #610).

 * Sudo's BSM audit support now works on Solaris 11.

 * Brazilian Portuguese translation for sudo and sudoers from
   translationproject.org.

 * Czech translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * French translation for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * Sudo's noexec support on Mac OS X 10.4 and above now uses dynamic
   symbol interposition instead of setting DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE=1
   which causes issues with some programs.

 * Fixed visudo's -q (--quiet) flag, broken in sudo 1.8.6.

 * Root may no longer change its SELinux role without entering
   a password.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.7 where the indexes written
   to the I/O log timing file are two greater than they should be.
   Sudoreplay now contains a work-around to parse those files.

 * In sudoreplay's list mode, the "this" qualifier in "fromdate"
   or "todate" expressions now behaves more sensibly.  Previously,
   it would often match a date that was "one more" than expected.
   For example, "this week" now matches the current week instead
   of the following week.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.7?

 * The non-Unix group plugin is now supported when sudoers data
   is stored in LDAP.

 * Sudo now uses a workaround for a locale bug on Solaris 11.0
   that prevents setuid programs like sudo from fully using locales.

 * User messages are now always displayed in the user's locale,
   even when the same message is being logged or mailed in a
   different locale.

 * Log files created by sudo now explicitly have the group set
   to group ID 0 rather than relying on BSD group semantics (which
   may not be the default).

 * A new "exec_background" sudoers option can be used to initially
   run the command without read access to the terminal when running
   a command in a pseudo-tty.  If the command tries to read from
   the terminal it will be stopped by the kernel (via SIGTTIN or
   SIGTTOU) and sudo will immediately restart it as the foreground
   process (if possible).  This allows sudo to only pass terminal
   input to the program if the program actually is expecting it.
   Unfortunately, a few poorly-behaved programs (like "su" on most
   Linux systems) do not handle SIGTTIN and SIGTTOU properly.

 * Sudo now uses an efficient group query to get all the groups
   for a user instead of iterating over every record in the group
   database on HP-UX and Solaris.

 * Sudo now produces better error messages when there is an error
   in the sudo.conf file.

 * Two new settings have been added to sudo.conf to give the admin
   better control of how group database queries are performed.  The
   "group_source" specifies how the group list for a user will be
   determined.  Legal values are "static" (use the kernel groups
   list), "dynamic" (perform a group database query) and "adaptive"
   (only perform a group database query if the kernel list is full).
   The "max_groups" setting specifies the maximum number of groups
   a user may belong to when performing a group database query.

 * The sudo.conf file now supports line continuation by using a
   backslash as the last character on the line.

 * There is now a standalone sudo.conf manual page.

 * Sudo now stores its libexec files in a "sudo" sub-directory instead
   of in libexec itself. For backward compatibility, if the plugin
   is not found in the default plugin directory, sudo will check
   the parent directory if the default directory ends in "/sudo".

 * The sudoers I/O logging plugin now logs the terminal size.

 * A new sudoers option "maxseq" can be used to limit the number of
   I/O log entries that are stored.

 * The "system_group" and "group_file" sudoers group provider plugins
   are now installed by default.

 * The list output (sudo -l) output from the sudoers plugin is now
   less ambiguous when an entry includes different runas users.
   The long list output (sudo -ll) for file-based sudoers is now
   more consistent with the format of LDAP-based sudoers.

 * A UID may now be used in the sudoRunAsUser attributes for LDAP
   sudoers.

 * Minor plugin API change: the close and version functions are now
   optional.  If the policy plugin does not provide a close function
   and the command is not being run in a new pseudo-tty, sudo may
   now execute the command directly instead of in a child process.

 * A new sudoers option "pam_session" can be used to disable sudo's
   PAM session support.

 * On HP-UX systems, sudo will now use the pstat() function to
   determine the tty instead of ttyname().

 * Turkish translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Dutch translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Tivoli Directory Server client libraries may now be used with
   HP-UX where libibmldap has a hidden dependency on libCsup.

 * The sudoers plugin will now ignore invalid domain names when
   checking netgroup membership.  Most Linux systems use the string
   "(none)" for the NIS-style domain name instead of an empty string.

 * New support for specifying a SHA-2 digest along with the command
   in sudoers.  Supported hash types are sha224, sha256, sha384 and
   sha512.  See the description of Digest_Spec in the sudoers manual
   or the description of sudoCommand in the sudoers.ldap manual for
   details.

 * The paths to ldap.conf and ldap.secret may now be specified as
   arguments to the sudoers plugin in the sudo.conf file.

 * Fixed potential false positives in visudo's alias cycle detection.

 * Fixed a problem where the time stamp file was being treated
   as out of date on Linux systems where the change time on the
   pseudo-tty device node can change after it is allocated.

 * Sudo now only builds Position Independent Executables (PIE)
   by default on Linux systems and verifies that a trivial test
   program builds and runs.

 * On Solaris 11.1 and higher, sudo binaries will now have the
   ASLR tag enabled if supported by the linker.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p8?

 * Terminal detection now works properly on 64-bit AIX kernels.
   This was broken by the removal of the ttyname() fallback in Sudo
   1.8.6p6.  Sudo is now able to map an AIX 64-bit device number
   to the corresponding device file in /dev.

 * Sudo now checks for crypt() returning NULL when performing
   passwd-based authentication.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p7?

 * A time stamp file with the date set to the epoch by "sudo -k"
   is now completely ignored regardless of what the local clock is
   set to.  Previously, if the local clock was set to a value between
   the epoch and the time stamp timeout value, a time stamp reset
   by "sudo -k" would be considered current.

 * The tty-specific time stamp file now includes the session ID
   of the sudo process that created it.  If a process with the same
   tty but a different session ID runs sudo, the user will now be
   prompted for a password (assuming authentication is required for
   the command).

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p6?

 * On systems where the controlling tty can be determined via /proc
   or sysctl(), sudo will no longer fall back to using ttyname()
   if the process has no controlling tty.  This prevents sudo from
   using a non-controlling tty for logging and time stamp purposes.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p5?

 * Fixed a potential crash in visudo's alias cycle detection.

 * Improved performance on Solaris when retrieving the group list
   for the target user.  On systems with a large number of groups
   where the group database is not local (NIS, LDAP, AD), fetching
   the group list could take a minute or more.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p4?

 * The -fstack-protector is now used when linking visudo, sudoreplay
   and testsudoers.

 * Avoid building PIE binaries on FreeBSD/ia64 as they don't run
   properly.

 * Fixed a crash in visudo strict mode when an unknown Defaults
   setting is encountered.

 * Do not inform the user that the command was not permitted by the
   policy if they do not successfully authenticate. This is a
   regression introduced in sudo 1.8.6.

 * Allow sudo to be build with sss support without also including
   ldap support.

 * Fixed running commands that need the terminal in the background
   when I/O logging is enabled. E.g. "sudo vi &". When the command
   is foregrounded, it will now resume properly.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p3?

 * Fixed post-processing of the man pages on systems with legacy
   versions of sed.

 * Fixed "sudoreplay -l" on Linux systems with file systems that
   set DT_UNKNOWN in the d_type field of struct dirent.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p2?

 * Fixed suspending a command after it has already been resumed
   once when I/O logging (or use_pty) is not enabled.
   This was a regression introduced in version 1.8.6.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6p1?

 * Fixed the setting of LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME variables in the
   command's environment when env_reset is enabled (the default).
   This was a regression introduced in version 1.8.6.

 * Sudo now honors SUCCESS=return in /etc/nsswitch.conf.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.6?

 * Sudo is now built with the -fstack-protector flag if the the
   compiler supports it.  Also, the -zrelro linker flag is used if
   supported.  The --disable-hardening configure option can be used
   to build sudo without stack smashing protection.

 * Sudo is now built as a Position Independent Executable (PIE)
   if supported by the compiler and linker.

 * If the user is a member of the "exempt" group in sudoers, they
   will no longer be prompted for a password even if the -k flag
   is specified with the command.  This makes "sudo -k command"
   consistent with the behavior one would get if the user ran "sudo
   -k" immediately before running the command.

 * The sudoers file may now be a symbolic link.  Previously, sudo
   would refuse to read sudoers unless it was a regular file.

 * The sudoreplay command can now properly replay sessions where
   no tty was present.

 * The sudoers plugin now takes advantage of symbol visibility
   controls when supported by the compiler or linker.  As a result,
   only a small number of symbols are exported which significantly
   reduces the chances of a conflict with other shared objects.

 * Improved support for the Tivoli Directory Server LDAP client
   libraries.  This includes support for using LDAP over SSL (ldaps)
   as well as support for the BIND_TIMELIMIT, TLS_KEY and TLS_CIPHERS
   ldap.conf options.  A new ldap.conf option, TLS_KEYPW can be
   used to specify a password to decrypt the key database.

 * When constructing a time filter for use with LDAP sudoNotBefore
   and sudoNotAfter attributes, the current time now includes tenths
   of a second.  This fixes a problem with timed entries on Active
   Directory.

 * If a user fails to authenticate and the command would be rejected
   by sudoers, it is now logged with "command not allowed" instead
   of "N incorrect password attempts".  Likewise, the "mail_no_perms"
   sudoers option now takes precedence over "mail_badpass".

 * The sudo manuals are now formatted using the mdoc macros.  Versions
   using the legacy man macros are provided for systems that lack mdoc.

 * New support for Solaris privilege sets.  This makes it possible
   to specify fine-grained privileges in the sudoers file on Solaris
   10 and above.  A Runas_Spec that contains no Runas_Lists can be
   used to give a user the ability to run a command as themselves
   but with an expanded privilege set.

 * Fixed a problem with the reboot and shutdown commands on some
   systems (such as HP-UX and BSD).  On these systems, reboot sends
   all processes (except itself) SIGTERM.  When sudo received
   SIGTERM, it would relay it to the reboot process, thus killing
   reboot before it had a chance to actually reboot the system.

 * Support for using the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) as
   a source of sudoers data.

 * Slovenian translation for sudo and sudoers from translationproject.org.

 * Visudo will now warn about unknown Defaults entries that are
   per-host, per-user, per-runas or per-command.

 * Fixed a race condition that could cause sudo to receive SIGTTOU
   (and stop) when resuming a shell that was run via sudo when I/O
   logging (and use_pty) is not enabled.

 * Sending SIGTSTP directly to the sudo process will now suspend the
   running command when I/O logging (and use_pty) is not enabled.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.5p3?

 * Fixed the loading of I/O plugins that conform to a plugin API
   version older than 1.2.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.5p2?

 * Fixed use of the SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable which was
   broken in Sudo 1.8.5.

 * Fixed a problem reading the sudoers file when the file mode is
   more restrictive than the expected mode.  For example, when the
   expected sudoers file mode is 0440 but the actual mode is 0400.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.5p1?

 * Fixed a bug that prevented files in an include directory from
   being evaluated.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.5?

 * When "noexec" is enabled, sudo_noexec.so will now be prepended
   to any existing LD_PRELOAD variable instead of replacing it.

 * The sudo_noexec.so shared library now wraps the execvpe(),
   exect(), posix_spawn() and posix_spawnp() functions.

 * The user/group/mode checks on sudoers files have been relaxed.
   As long as the file is owned by the sudoers UID, not world-writable
   and not writable by a group other than the sudoers GID, the file
   is considered OK.  Note that visudo will still set the mode to
   the value specified at configure time.

 * It is now possible to specify the sudoers path, UID, GID and
   file mode as options to the plugin in the sudo.conf file.

 * Croatian, Galician, German, Lithuanian, Swedish and Vietnamese
   translations from translationproject.org.

 * /etc/environment is no longer read directly on Linux systems
   when PAM is used.  Sudo now merges the PAM environment into the
   user's environment which is typically set by the pam_env module.

 * The initial environment created when env_reset is in effect now
   includes the contents of /etc/environment on AIX systems and the
   "setenv" and "path" entries from /etc/login.conf on BSD systems.

 * The plugin API has been extended in three ways.  First, options
   specified in sudo.conf after the plugin pathname are passed to
   the plugin's open function.  Second, sudo has limited support
   for hooks that can be used by plugins.  Currently, the hooks are
   limited to environment handling functions.  Third, the init_session
   policy plugin function is passed a pointer to the user environment
   which can be updated during session setup.  The plugin API version
   has been incremented to version 1.2.  See the sudo_plugin manual
   for more information.

 * The policy plugin's init_session function is now called by the
   parent sudo process, not the child process that executes the
   command.  This allows the PAM session to be open and closed in
   the same process, which some PAM modules require.

 * Fixed parsing of "Path askpass" and "Path noexec" in sudo.conf,
   which was broken in version 1.8.4.

 * On systems with an SVR4-style /proc file system, the /proc/pid/psinfo
   file is now uses to determine the controlling terminal, if possible.
   This allows tty-based tickets to work properly even when, e.g.
   standard input, output and error are redirected to /dev/null.

 * The output of "sudoreplay -l" is now sorted by file name (or
   sequence number).  Previously, entries were displayed in the
   order in which they were found on the file system.

 * Sudo now behaves properly when I/O logging is enabled and the
   controlling terminal is revoked (e.g. the running sshd is killed).
   Previously, sudo may have exited without calling the I/O plugin's
   close function which can lead to an incomplete I/O log.

 * Sudo can now detect when a user has logged out and back in again
   on Solaris 11, just like it can on Solaris 10.

 * The built-in zlib included with Sudo has been upgraded to version
   1.2.6.

 * Setting the SSL parameter to start_tls in ldap.conf now works
   properly when using Mozilla-based SDKs that support the
   ldap_start_tls_s() function.

 * The TLS_CHECKPEER parameter in ldap.conf now works when the
   Mozilla NSS crypto back-end is used with OpenLDAP.

 * A new group provider plugin, system_group, is included which
   performs group look ups by name using the system groups database.
   This can be used to restore the pre-1.7.3 sudo group lookup
   behavior.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.4p5?

 * Fixed a bug when matching against an IP address with an associated
   netmask in the sudoers file.  In certain circumstances, this
   could allow users to run commands on hosts they are not authorized
   for.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.4p4?

 * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 which prevented "sudo -v"
   from working.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.4p3?

 * Fixed a crash on FreeBSD when no tty is present.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 that allowed users to
   specify environment variables to set on the command line without
   having sudo "ALL" permissions or the "SETENV" tag.

 * When visudo is run with the -c (check) option, the sudoers
   file(s) owner and mode are now also checked unless the -f option
   was specified.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.4p2?

 * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 where insufficient space
   was allocated for group IDs in the LDAP filter.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 where the path to sudo.conf
   was "/sudo.conf" instead of "/etc/sudo.conf".

 * Fixed a bug introduced in Sudo 1.8.4 which could cause a hang
   when I/O logging is enabled and input is from a pipe or file.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.4p1?

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.8.4 that broke adding to or
   deleting from the env_keep, env_check and env_delete lists in
   sudoers on some platforms.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.4?

 * The -D flag in sudo has been replaced with a more general debugging
   framework that is configured in sudo.conf.

 * Fixed a false positive in visudo strict mode when aliases are
   in use.

 * Fixed a crash with "sudo -i" when a runas group was specified
   without a runas user.

 * The line on which a syntax error is reported in the sudoers file
   is now more accurate.  Previously it was often off by a line.

 * Fixed a bug where stack garbage could be printed at the end of
   the lecture when the "lecture_file" option was enabled.

 * "make install" now honors the LINGUAS environment variable.

 * The #include and #includedir directives in sudoers now support
   relative paths.  If the path is not fully qualified it is expected
   to be located in the same directory of the sudoers file that is
   including it.

 * Serbian and Spanish translations for sudo from translationproject.org.

 * LDAP-based sudoers may now access by group ID in addition to
   group name.

 * visudo will now fix the mode on the sudoers file even if no changes
   are made unless the -f option is specified.

 * The "use_loginclass" sudoers option works properly again.

 * On systems that use login.conf, "sudo -i" now sets environment
   variables based on login.conf.

 * For LDAP-based sudoers, values in the search expression are now
   escaped as per RFC 4515.

 * The plugin close function is now properly called when a login
   session is killed (as opposed to the actual command being killed).
   This can happen when an ssh session is disconnected or the
   terminal window is closed.

 * The deprecated "noexec_file" sudoers option is no longer supported.

 * Fixed a race condition when I/O logging is not enabled that could
   result in tty-generated signals (e.g. control-C) being received
   by the command twice.

 * If none of the standard input, output or error are connected to
   a tty device, sudo will now check its parent's standard input,
   output or error for the tty name on systems with /proc and BSD
   systems that support the KERN_PROC_PID sysctl.  This allows
   tty-based tickets to work properly even when, e.g. standard
   input, output and error are redirected to /dev/null.

 * Added the --enable-kerb5-instance configure option to allow
   people using Kerberos V authentication to specify a custom
   instance so the principal name can be, e.g. "username/sudo"
   similar to how ksu uses "username/root".

 * Fixed a bug where a pattern like "/usr/*" included /usr/bin/ in
   the results, which would be incorrectly be interpreted as if the
   sudoers file had specified a directory.

 * "visudo -c" will now list any include files that were checked
   in addition to the main sudoers file when everything parses OK.

 * Users that only have read-only access to the sudoers file may
   now run "visudo -c".  Previously, write permissions were required
   even though no writing is down in check-only mode.

 * It is now possible to prevent the disabling of core dumps from
   within sudo itself by adding a line to the sudo.conf file like
   "Set disable_coredump false".

What's new in Sudo 1.8.3p2?

 * Fixed a format string vulnerability when the sudo binary (or a
   symbolic link to the sudo binary) contains printf format escapes
   and the -D (debugging) flag is used.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.3p1?

 * Fixed a crash in the monitor process on Solaris when NOPASSWD
   was specified or when authentication was disabled.

 * Fixed matching of a Runas_Alias in the group section of a
   Runas_Spec.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.3?

 * Fixed expansion of strftime() escape sequences in the "log_dir"
   sudoers setting.

 * Esperanto, Italian and Japanese translations from translationproject.org.

 * Sudo will now use PAM by default on AIX 6 and higher.

 * Added --enable-werror configure option for gcc's -Werror flag.

 * Visudo no longer assumes all editors support the +linenumber
   command line argument.  It now uses a allowlist of editors known
   to support the option.

 * Fixed matching of network addresses when a netmask is specified
   but the address is not the first one in the CIDR block.

 * The configure script now check whether or not errno.h declares
   the errno variable.  Previously, sudo would always declare errno
   itself for older systems that don't declare it in errno.h.

 * The NOPASSWD tag is now honored for denied commands too, which
   matches historic sudo behavior (prior to sudo 1.7.0).

 * Sudo now honors the "DEREF" setting in ldap.conf which controls
   how alias dereferencing is done during an LDAP search.

 * A symbol conflict with the pam_ssh_agent_auth PAM module that
   would cause a crash been resolved.

 * The inability to load a group provider plugin is no longer
   a fatal error.

 * A potential crash in the utmp handling code has been fixed.

 * Two PAM session issues have been resolved.  In previous versions
   of sudo, the PAM session was opened as one user and closed as
   another.  Additionally, if no authentication was performed, the
   PAM session would never be closed.

 * Sudo will now work correctly with LDAP-based sudoers using TLS
   or SSL on Debian systems.

 * The LOGNAME, USER and USERNAME environment variables are preserved
   correctly again in sudoedit mode.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.2?

 * Sudo, visudo, sudoreplay and the sudoers plug-in now have natural
   language support (NLS). This can be disabled by passing configure
   the --disable-nls option.  Sudo will use gettext(), if available,
   to display translated messages.  All translations are coordinated
   via The Translation Project, https://translationproject.org/.

 * Plug-ins are now loaded with the RTLD_GLOBAL flag instead of
   RTLD_LOCAL.  This fixes missing symbol problems in PAM modules
   on certain platforms, such as FreeBSD and SuSE Linux Enterprise.

 * I/O logging is now supported for commands run in background mode
   (using sudo's -b flag).

 * Group ownership of the sudoers file is now only enforced when
   the file mode on sudoers allows group readability or writability.

 * Visudo now checks the contents of an alias and warns about cycles
   when the alias is expanded.

 * If the user specifies a group via sudo's -g option that matches
   the target user's group in the password database, it is now
   allowed even if no groups are present in the Runas_Spec.

 * The sudo Makefiles now have more complete dependencies which are
   automatically generated instead of being maintained manually.

 * The "use_pty" sudoers option is now correctly passed back to the
   sudo front end.  This was missing in previous versions of sudo
   1.8 which prevented "use_pty" from being honored.

 * "sudo -i command" now works correctly with the bash version
   2.0 and higher.  Previously, the .bash_profile would not be
   sourced prior to running the command unless bash was built with
   NON_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN_SHELLS defined.

 * When matching groups in the sudoers file, sudo will now match
   based on the name of the group instead of the group ID. This can
   substantially reduce the number of group lookups for sudoers
   files that contain a large number of groups.

 * Multi-factor authentication is now supported on AIX.

 * Added support for non-RFC 4517 compliant LDAP servers that require
   that seconds be present in a timestamp, such as Tivoli Directory Server.

 * If the group vector is to be preserved, the PATH search for the
   command is now done with the user's original group vector.

 * For LDAP-based sudoers, the "runas_default" sudoOption now works
   properly in a sudoRole that contains a sudoCommand.

 * Spaces in command line arguments for "sudo -s" and "sudo -i" are
   now escaped with a backslash when checking the security policy.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.1p2?

 * Two-character CIDR-style IPv4 netmasks are now matched correctly
   in the sudoers file.

 * A build error with MIT Kerberos V has been resolved.

 * A crash on HP-UX in the sudoers plugin when wildcards are
   present in the sudoers file has been resolved.

 * Sudo now works correctly on Tru64 Unix again.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.1p1?

 * Fixed a problem on AIX where sudo was unable to set the final
   UID if the PAM module modified the effective UID.

 * A non-existent includedir is now treated the same as an empty
   directory and not reported as an error.

 * Removed extraneous parens in LDAP filter when sudoers_search_filter
   is enabled that can cause an LDAP search error.

 * Fixed a "make -j" problem for "make install".

What's new in Sudo 1.8.1?

 * A new LDAP setting, sudoers_search_filter, has been added to
   ldap.conf.  This setting can be used to restrict the set of
   records returned by the LDAP query.  Based on changes from Matthew
   Thomas.

 * White space is now permitted within a User_List when used in
   conjunction with a per-user Defaults definition.

 * A group ID (%#GID) may now be specified in a User_List or Runas_List.
   Likewise, for non-Unix groups the syntax is %:#GID.

 * Support for double-quoted words in the sudoers file has been fixed.
   The change in 1.7.5 for escaping the double quote character
   caused the double quoting to only be available at the beginning
   of an entry.

 * The fix for resuming a suspended shell in 1.7.5 caused problems
   with resuming non-shells on Linux.  Sudo will now save the process
   group ID of the program it is running on suspend and restore it
   when resuming, which fixes both problems.

 * A bug that could result in corrupted output in "sudo -l" has been
   fixed.

 * Sudo will now create an entry in the utmp (or utmpx) file when
   allocating a pseudo-tty (e.g. when logging I/O).  The "set_utmp"
   and "utmp_runas" sudoers file options can be used to control this.
   Other policy plugins may use the "set_utmp" and "utmp_user"
   entries in the command_info list.

 * The sudoers policy now stores the TSID field in the logs
   even when the "iolog_file" sudoers option is defined to a value
   other than %{sessid}.  Previously, the TSID field was only
   included in the log file when the "iolog_file" option was set
   to its default value.

 * The sudoreplay utility now supports arbitrary session IDs.
   Previously, it would only work with the base-36 session IDs
   that the sudoers plugin uses by default.

 * Sudo now passes "run_shell=true" to the policy plugin in the
   settings list when sudo's -s command line option is specified.
   The sudoers policy plugin uses this to implement the "set_home"
   sudoers option which was missing from sudo 1.8.0.

 * The "noexec" functionality has been moved out of the sudoers
   policy plugin and into the sudo front-end, which matches the
   behavior documented in the plugin writer's guide.  As a result,
   the path to the noexec file is now specified in the sudo.conf
   file instead of the sudoers file.

 * On Solaris 10, the PRIV_PROC_EXEC privilege is now used to
   implement the "noexec" feature.  Previously, this was implemented
   via the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.

 * The exit values for "sudo -l", "sudo -v" and "sudo -l command"
   have been fixed in the sudoers policy plugin.

 * The sudoers policy plugin now passes the login class, if any,
   back to the sudo front-end.

 * The sudoers policy plugin was not being linked with requisite
   libraries in certain configurations.

 * Sudo now parses command line arguments before loading any plugins.
   This allows "sudo -V" or "sudo -h" to work even if there is a problem
   with sudo.conf

 * Plugins are now linked with the static version of libgcc to allow
   the plugin to run on a system where no shared libgcc is installed,
   or where it is installed in a different location.

What's new in Sudo 1.8.0?

 * Sudo has been refactored to use a modular framework that can
   support third-party policy and I/O logging plugins.  The default
   plugin is "sudoers" which provides the traditional sudo functionality.
   See the sudo_plugin manual for details on the plugin API and the
   sample in the plugins directory for a simple example.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.5?

 * When using visudo in check mode, a file named "-" may be used to
   check sudoers data on the standard input.

 * Sudo now only fetches shadow password entries when using the
   password database directly for authentication.

 * Password and group entries are now cached using the same key
   that was used to look them up.  This fixes a problem when looking
   up entries by name if the name in the retrieved entry does not
   match the name used to look it up.  This may happen on some systems
   that do case insensitive lookups or that truncate long names.

 * GCC will no longer display warnings on glibc systems that use
   the warn_unused_result attribute for write(2) and other system calls.

 * If a PAM account management module denies access, sudo now prints
   a more useful error message and stops trying to validate the user.

 * Fixed a potential hang on idle systems when the sudo-run process
   exits immediately.

 * Sudo now includes a copy of zlib that will be used on systems
   that do not have zlib installed.

 * The --with-umask-override configure flag has been added to enable
   the "umask_override" sudoers Defaults option at build time.

 * Sudo now unblocks all signals on startup to avoid problems caused
   by the parent process changing the default signal mask.

 * LDAP Sudoers entries may now specify a time period for which
   the entry is valid.  This requires an updated sudoers schema
   that includes the sudoNotBefore and sudoNotAfter attributes.
   Support for timed entries must be explicitly enabled in the
   ldap.conf file.  Based on changes from Andreas Mueller.

 * LDAP Sudoers entries may now specify a sudoOrder attribute that
   determines the order in which matching entries are applied.  The
   last matching entry is used, just like file-based sudoers.  This
   requires an updated sudoers schema that includes the sudoOrder
   attribute.  Based on changes from Andreas Mueller.

 * When run as sudoedit, or when given the -e flag, sudo now treats
   command line arguments as pathnames.  This means that slashes
   in the sudoers file entry must explicitly match slashes in
   the command line arguments.  As a result, and entry such as:
	user ALL = sudoedit /etc/*
   will allow editing of /etc/motd but not /etc/security/default.

 * NETWORK_TIMEOUT is now an alias for BIND_TIMELIMIT in ldap.conf for
   compatibility with OpenLDAP configuration files.

 * The LDAP API TIMEOUT parameter is now honored in ldap.conf.

 * The I/O log directory may now be specified in the sudoers file.

 * Sudo will no longer refuse to run if the sudoers file is writable
   by root.

 * Sudo now performs command line escaping for "sudo -s" and "sudo -i"
   after validating the command so the sudoers entries do not need
   to include the backslashes.

 * Logging and email sending are now done in the locale specified
   by the "sudoers_locale" setting ("C" by default).  Email send by
   sudo now includes MIME headers when "sudoers_locale" is not "C".

 * The configure script has a new option, --disable-env-reset, to
   allow one to change the default for the sudoers Default setting
   "env_reset" at compile time.

 * When logging "sudo -l command", sudo will now prepend "list "
   to the command in the log line to distinguish between an
   actual command invocation in the logs.

 * Double-quoted group and user names may now include escaped double
   quotes as part of the name.  Previously this was a parse error.

 * Sudo once again restores the state of the signal handlers it
   modifies before executing the command.  This allows sudo to be
   used with the nohup command.

 * Resuming a suspended shell now works properly when I/O logging
   is not enabled (the I/O logging case was already correct).

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4p6?

 * A bug has been fixed in the I/O logging support that could cause
   visual artifacts in full-screen programs such as text editors.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4p5?

 * A bug has been fixed that would allow a command to be run without the
   user entering a password when sudo's -g flag is used without the -u flag.

 * If user has no supplementary groups, sudo will now fall back on checking
   the group file explicitly, which restores historic sudo behavior.

 * A crash has been fixed when sudo's -g flag is used without the -u flag
   and the sudoers file contains an entry with no runas user or group listed.

 * A crash has been fixed when the Solaris project support is enabled
   and sudo's -g flag is used without the -u flag.

 * Sudo no longer exits with an error when support for auditing is
   compiled in but auditing is not enabled.

 * Fixed a bug introduced in sudo 1.7.3 where the ticket file was not
   being honored when the "targetpw" sudoers Defaults option was enabled.

 * The LOG_INPUT and LOG_OUTPUT tags in sudoers are now parsed correctly.

 * A crash has been fixed in "sudo -l" when sudo is built with auditing
   support and the user is not allowed to run any commands on the host.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4p4?

 * A potential security issue has been fixed with respect to the handling
   of sudo's -g command line option when -u is also specified.  The flaw
   may allow an attacker to run commands as a user that is not authorized
   by the sudoers file.

 * A bug has been fixed where "sudo -l" output was incomplete if multiple
   sudoers sources were defined in nsswitch.conf and there was an error
   querying one of the sources.

 * The log_input, log_output, and use_pty sudoers options now work correctly
   on AIX.  Previously, sudo would hang if they were enabled.

 * The "make install" target now works correctly when sudo is built in a
   directory other than the source directory.

 * The "runas_default" sudoers setting now works properly in a per-command
   Defaults line.

 * Suspending and resuming the bash shell when PAM is in use now works
   correctly.  The SIGCONT signal was not propagated to the child process.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4p3?

 * A bug has been fixed where duplicate HOME environment variables could be
   present when the env_reset setting was disabled and the always_set_home
   setting was enabled in sudoers.

 * The value of sysconfdir is now substituted into the path to the sudoers.d
   directory in the installed sudoers file.

 * Compilation problems on IRIX and other platforms have been fixed.

 * If multiple PAM "auth" actions are specified and the user enters ^C at
   the password prompt, sudo will no longer prompt for a password for any
   subsequent "auth" actions.  Previously it was necessary to enter ^C for
   each "auth" action.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4p2?

 * A bug where sudo could spin in a busy loop waiting for the child process
   has been fixed.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4p1?

 * A bug introduced in sudo 1.7.3 that prevented the -k and -K options from
   functioning when the tty_tickets sudoers option is enabled has been fixed.

 * Sudo no longer prints a warning when the -k or -K options are specified
   and the ticket file does not exist.

 * It is now easier to cross-compile sudo.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.4?

 * Sudoedit will now preserve the file extension in the name of the
   temporary file being edited.  The extension is used by some
   editors (such as emacs) to choose the editing mode.

 * Time stamp files have moved from /var/run/sudo to either /var/db/sudo,
   /var/lib/sudo or /var/adm/sudo.  The directories are checked for
   existence in that order.  This prevents users from receiving the
   sudo lecture every time the system reboots.  Time stamp files older
   than the boot time are ignored on systems where it is possible to
   determine this.

 * The tty_tickets sudoers option is now enabled by default.

 * Ancillary documentation (README files, LICENSE, etc) is now installed
   in a sudo documentation directory.

 * Sudo now recognizes "tls_cacert" as an alias for "tls_cacertfile"
   in ldap.conf.

 * Defaults settings that are tied to a user, host or command may
   now include the negation operator.  For example:
	Defaults:!millert lecture
   will match any user but millert.

 * The default PATH environment variable, used when no PATH variable
    exists, now includes /usr/sbin and /sbin.

 * Sudo now uses polypkg (https://github.com/OneIdentity/Polypkg)
   for cross-platform packing.

 * On Linux, sudo will now restore the nproc resource limit before
   executing a command, unless the limit appears to have been modified
   by pam_limits.  This avoids a problem with bash scripts that open
   more than 32 descriptors on SuSE Linux, where sysconf(_SC_CHILD_MAX)
   will return -1 when RLIMIT_NPROC is set to RLIMIT_UNLIMITED (-1).

 * The HOME and MAIL environment variables are now reset based on the
   target user's password database entry when the env_reset sudoers option
   is enabled (which is the case in the default configuration).  Users
   wishing to preserve the original values should use a sudoers entry like:
	Defaults env_keep += HOME
   to preserve the old value of HOME and
	Defaults env_keep += MAIL
   to preserve the old value of MAIL.

 * Fixed a problem in the restoration of the AIX authdb registry setting.

 * Sudo will now fork(2) and wait until the command has completed before
   calling pam_close_session().

 * The default syslog facility is now "authpriv" if the operating system
   supports it, else "auth".

What's new in Sudo 1.7.3?

 * Support for logging I/O for the command being run.
   For more information, see the documentation for the "log_input"
   and "log_output" Defaults options in the sudoers manual.  Also
   see the sudoreplay manual for how to replay I/O log sessions.

 * The use_pty sudoers option can be used to force a command to be
   run in a pseudo-pty, even when I/O logging is not enabled.

 * On some systems, sudo can now detect when a user has logged out
   and back in again when tty-based time stamps are in use.  Supported
   systems include Solaris systems with the devices file system,
   Mac OS X, and Linux systems with the devpts filesystem (pseudo-ttys
   only).

 * On AIX systems, the registry setting in /etc/security/user is
   now taken into account when looking up users and groups.  Sudo
   now applies the correct the user and group ids when running a
   command as a user whose account details come from a different
   source (e.g. LDAP or DCE vs.  local files).

 * Support for multiple 'sudoers_base' and 'uri' entries in ldap.conf.
   When multiple entries are listed, sudo will try each one in the
   order in which they are specified.

 * Sudo's SELinux support should now function correctly when running
   commands as a non-root user and when one of stdin, stdout or stderr
   is not a terminal.

 * Sudo will now use the Linux audit system with configure with
   the --with-linux-audit flag.

 * Sudo now uses mbr_check_membership() on systems that support it
   to determine group membership.  Currently, only Darwin (Mac OS X)
   supports this.

 * When the tty_tickets sudoers option is enabled but there is no
   terminal device, sudo will no longer use or create a tty-based
   ticket file.  Previously, sudo would use a tty name of "unknown".
   As a consequence, if a user has no terminal device, sudo will
   now always prompt for a password.

 * The passwd_timeout and timestamp_timeout options may now be
   specified as floating point numbers for more granular timeout
   values.

 * Negating the fqdn option in sudoers now works correctly when sudo
   is configured with the --with-fqdn option.  In previous versions
   of sudo the fqdn was set before sudoers was parsed.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.2?

 * A new #includedir directive is available in sudoers.  This can be
   used to implement an /etc/sudo.d directory.  Files in an includedir
   are not edited by visudo unless they contain a syntax error.

 * The -g option did not work properly when only setting the group
   (and not the user).  Also, in -l mode the wrong user was displayed
   for sudoers entries where only the group was allowed to be set.

 * Fixed a problem with the alias checking in visudo which
   could prevent visudo from exiting.

 * Sudo will now correctly parse the shell-style /etc/environment
   file format used by pam_env on Linux.

 * When doing password and group database lookups, sudo will only
   cache an entry by name or by id, depending on how the entry was
   looked up.  Previously, sudo would cache by both name and id
   from a single lookup, but this breaks sites that have multiple
   password or group database names that map to the same UID or
   GID.

 * User and group names in sudoers may now be enclosed in double
   quotes to avoid having to escape special characters.

 * BSM audit fixes when changing to a non-root UID.

 * Experimental non-Unix group support.  Currently only works with
   Quest Authorization Services and allows Active Directory groups
   fixes for Minix-3.

 * For Netscape/Mozilla-derived LDAP SDKs the certificate and key
   paths may be specified as a directory or a file.  However, version
   5.0 of the SDK only appears to support using a directory (despite
   documentation to the contrary).  If SSL client initialization
   fails and the certificate or key paths look like they could be
   default file name, strip off the last path element and try again.

 * A setenv() compatibility fix for Linux systems, where a NULL
   value is treated the same as an empty string and the variable
   name is checked against the NULL pointer.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.1?

 * A new Defaults option "pwfeedback" will cause sudo to provide visual
   feedback when the user is entering a password.

 * A new Defaults option "fast_glob" will cause sudo to use the fnmatch()
   function for file name globbing instead of glob().  When this option
   is enabled, sudo will not check the file system when expanding wildcards.
   This is faster but a side effect is that relative paths with wildcard
   will no longer work.

 * New BSM audit support for systems that support it such as FreeBSD
   and Mac OS X.

 * The file name specified with the #include directive may now include
   a %h escape which is expanded to the short form of hostname.

 * The -k flag may now be specified along with a command, causing the
   user's timestamp file to be ignored.

 * New support for Tivoli-based LDAP START_TLS, present in AIX.

 * New support for /etc/netsvc.conf on AIX.

 * The unused alias checks in visudo now handle the case of an alias
   referring to another alias.

What's new in Sudo 1.7.0?

 * Rewritten parser that converts sudoers into a set of data structures.
   This eliminates a number of ordering issues and makes it possible to
   apply sudoers Defaults entries before searching for the command.
   It also adds support for per-command Defaults specifications.

 * Sudoers now supports a #include facility to allow the inclusion of other
   sudoers-format files.

 * Sudo's -l (list) flag has been enhanced:
    o applicable Defaults options are now listed
    o a command argument can be specified for testing whether a user
      may run a specific command.
    o a new -U flag can be used in conjunction with "sudo -l" to allow
      root (or a user with "sudo ALL") list another user's privileges.

 * A new -g flag has been added to allow the user to specify a
   primary group to run the command as.  The sudoers syntax has been
   extended to include a group section in the Runas specification.

 * A UID may now be used anywhere a username is valid.

 * The "secure_path" run-time Defaults option has been restored.

 * Password and group data is now cached for fast lookups.

 * The file descriptor at which sudo starts closing all open files is now
   configurable via sudoers and, optionally, the command line.

 * Visudo will now warn about aliases that are defined but not used.

 * The -i and -s command line flags now take an optional command
   to be run via the shell.  Previously, the argument was passed
   to the shell as a script to run.

 * Improved LDAP support.  SASL authentication may now be used in
   conjunction when connecting to an LDAP server.  The krb5_ccname
   parameter in ldap.conf may be used to enable Kerberos.

 * Support for /etc/nsswitch.conf.  LDAP users may now use nsswitch.conf
   to specify the sudoers order.  E.g.:
	sudoers: ldap files
   to check LDAP, then /etc/sudoers.  The default is "files", even
   when LDAP support is compiled in.  This differs from sudo 1.6
   where LDAP was always consulted first.

 * Support for /etc/environment on AIX and Linux.  If sudo is run
   with the -i flag, the contents of /etc/environment are used to
   populate the new environment that is passed to the command being
   run.

 * If no terminal is available or if the new -A flag is specified,
   sudo will use a helper program to read the password if one is
   configured.  Typically, this is a graphical password prompter
   such as ssh-askpass.

 * A new Defaults option, "mailfrom" that sets the value of the
   "From:" field in the warning/error mail.  If unspecified, the
   login name of the invoking user is used.

 * A new Defaults option, "env_file" that refers to a file containing
   environment variables to be set in the command being run.

 * A new flag, -n, may be used to indicate that sudo should not
   prompt the user for a password and, instead, exit with an error
   if authentication is required.

 * If sudo needs to prompt for a password and it is unable to disable
   echo (and no askpass program is defined), it will refuse to run
   unless the "visiblepw" Defaults option has been specified.

 * Prior to version 1.7.0, hitting enter/return at the Password: prompt
   would exit sudo.  In sudo 1.7.0 and beyond, this is treated as
   an empty password.  To exit sudo, the user must press ^C or ^D
   at the prompt.

 * visudo will now check the sudoers file owner and mode in -c (check)
   mode when the -s (strict) flag is specified.

 * A new Defaults option "umask_override" will cause sudo to set the
   umask specified in sudoers even if it is more permissive than the
   invoking user's umask.
