# Sudo plugins:
#
# The plugin_path is relative to ${prefix}/libexec unless fully qualified.
# The plugin_name corresponds to a global symbol in the plugin
#   that contains the plugin interface structure.
# The plugin_options are optional.
#
# The sudoers plugin is used by default if no Plugin lines are present.

#
# Sudo askpass:
#
# An askpass helper program may be specified to provide a graphical
# password prompt for "sudo -A" support.  Sudo does not ship with its
# own askpass program but can use the OpenSSH askpass.
#
# Use the OpenSSH askpass
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass
#
# Use the Gnome OpenSSH askpass
#Path askpass /usr/libexec/openssh/gnome-ssh-askpass

#
# Sudo noexec:
#
# Path to a shared library containing replacements for the execv(),
# execve() and fexecve() library functions that just return an error.
# This is used to implement the "noexec" functionality on systems that
# support LD_PRELOAD or its equivalent.
# The compiled-in value is usually sufficient and should only be changed
# if you rename or move the sudo_noexec.so file.
#
Path noexec /usr/local/libexec/sudo_noexec.so
Path noexec /usr/libexec/sudo_noexec.so

#
# Core dumps:
#
# By default, sudo disables core dumps while it is executing (they
# are re-enabled for the command that is run).
# To aid in debugging sudo problems, you may wish to enable core
# dumps by setting "disable_coredump" to false.
#
Set disable_coredump false

#
# User groups:
#
# Sudo passes the user's group list to the policy plugin.
# If the user is a member of the maximum number of groups (usually 16),
# sudo will query the group database directly to be sure to include
# the full list of groups.
#
# On some systems, this can be expensive so the behavior is configurable.
# The "group_source" setting has three possible values:
#   static   - use the user's list of groups returned by the kernel.
#   dynamic  - query the group database to find the list of groups.
#   adaptive - if user is in less than the maximum number of groups.
#	       use the kernel list, else query the group database.
#
Set group_source static
