# This is a sample syslog.conf fragment for use with Sudo.
#
# By default, sudo logs to "authpriv" if your system supports it, else it
# uses "auth".  The facility can be set via the --with-logfac configure
# option or in the sudoers file.
# To see what syslog facility a sudo binary uses, run `sudo -V' as *root*.
#
# NOTES:
#	The whitespace in the following line is made up of <TAB>
#       characters, *not* spaces.  You cannot just cut and paste!
#
#	If you edit syslog.conf you need to send syslogd a HUP signal.
#	Ie: kill -HUP process_id
#
#	Syslogd will not create new log files for you, you must first
#	create the file before syslogd will log to it.  Eg.
#	'touch @log_dir@/sudo'

# This logs successful and failed sudo attempts to the file @log_dir@/auth
# If your system has the authpriv syslog facility, use authpriv.debug
auth.debug					@log_dir@/auth

# To log to a remote machine, use something like the following,
# where "loghost" is the name of the remote machine.
# If your system has the authpriv syslog facility, use authpriv.debug
auth.debug					@loghost
