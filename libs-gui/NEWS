1.2 Noteworthy changes in version '0.27.0'
==========================================

This version includes numerous bugfixes, compatibility improvements and
other changes accumulated over the last year.  It also enables work to
be done on integrating NSViews with a Core Animation renderer.

   * Make targetForAction safer.

   * installation: Fix the configure script.

1.4 Noteworthy changes in version '0.26.1'
==========================================

This version is released to conincide with version 1.25.1 of
gnustep-base, which contains changes required for this version of
gnustep-gui and gnustep-back.

   It includes an important workaround for users of GNUstep Objective-C
Runtime (libobjc2) and non-fragile ABI to avoid a bug in interaction
between the clang compiler and the runtime when non-fragile ABI is in
use.  Specifically, Clang and the runtime may disagree on what is the
offset of an ivar in a class's RAM. This manifested in a crash at
application startup due to misalignment of _gcontext inside NSThread.
See the mailing list discussion
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/discuss-gnustep/2017-12/msg00129.html)
for more information.

   It also contains the following changes:

   * tests: Cleanup of warnings.
   * tests: Fix text system deallocation test.
   * printing: Undefine __BLOCKS__ before including cups.h, as some
     versions of the header expect that libdispatch is present and used
     if __BLOCKS__ is defined.
   * graphics context: Workaround for Clang+libobjc2+nonfragile ABI
     issue.

1.5 Noteworthy changes in version '0.26.0'
==========================================

This version was bumped due to previous binary incompatibilities between
0.25.0 and 0.25.1.  This version also includes numerous compatibility
improvements from the Summer of Code project, and a wide variety of
other fixes.  Notably, it fixes the use of cupsGetPPD() in the printing
system.

   * printing: Add an include to get deprecated function cupsGetPPD() on
     newer CUPS systems.
   * chore: Bump required base version.
   * tiff: Support for writing resolution.
   * jpeg: Save resolution information if it is different from 72 dpi.
   * save panel: Fix return type of sorting function.
   * events: Add some newer Cocoa enums and one method with dummy
     implementation.
   * speech synthesis: NSSpeechSynthesizerDelegate is now a @protocol on
     runtimes that support it.
   * pasteboard: New type identifiers.
   * translations: Some work on Polish, Russian and German translations
   * cell: Improvements to mouse tracking logic on NSCell.
   * image: If an unknown named image is unarchived with a coder or
     keyed coder, keep the name.
   * screen: Add -backingScaleFactor and return 1.0.
   * window: Return 1.0 from -backingScaleFactor.

==========================================

The graphics/window interface was completely revamped.  Window functions
were split into a separate class, GSDisplayServer, and many PS and DPS
functions were removed that were never implemented.  However, new
functionality was added to make things faster and eventually implement
Quartz compatibility.

   In addition, the old backends, xgps and xdps were depreciated in
favor of a new backend, simply named back, which can be configured for a
variety of window server and graphics implementations, and also allow
for improved code sharing.

   In addition there is now a window server backend for Windows
computers, although it is in a very alpha state.

   Other improvements:
   * Mutliple screens are now handled properly (untested)
   * Better autolayout with GSTable and subclasses.

   * Much better gmodel support (particularly with nibs translated from
     NeXT or OPENSTEP 4.2).
   * Muh improved font classes and font support.

   In addition both the xgps and xdps backends have seen some large
efficiency improvements.  Much better font support.  The xdps backend
itself has seen speed improvements by at least a factor of 4.  Note
however, that the xdps backend is still considered experimental and you
may have to deal with many problems in order to get it working.  We
recommend sticking with the xgps backend (the default) for now.

1.52 Noteworthy changes in version '0.6.5'
==========================================

Many of the basic GUI classes have been vastly improved or rewritten,
thanks to Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it> and many others.

   In addition a preliminary version of an Interface Builder (Gorm) has
been written, thanks to Richard Frith-Macdonald
<richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

1.53 Noteworthy changes in version '0.6.0'
==========================================

A Huge amount of progress, although a lot still needs to be done.  It's
usable for a large base of moderately simple apps.  Several
NeXT/OpenStep apps and libraries have been ported with little changes.

   * Drag and Drop support fleshed out but not completed.
   * NSText and related classes rewritten.  Basic functionality but much
     needs to be done to finish them off.
   * nib2gmodel app works with MacOS-X
   * Work done in minimizing the backend which allowed a lot of
     functionality to move to the GNU library.
   * Menu code rewritten.
   * PopupButtons now work.
   * Many new images
   * Basic functionality for NSTabView
   * Much better lockFocus support in NSView.  Flipped views handled.
   * Rewrite of NSSavePanel and NSOpenPanel
   * Several fixes that at least double the speed of the gui.

1.54 Noteworthy changes in version '0.5.5'
==========================================

Too extensive to list.

   * A lot of rewritting has been done to the classes, with general
     cleanup of coordinate conversion code, etc.

1.55 Noteworthy changes in version '0.5.0'
==========================================

   * NSBrowser and NSBrowserCell have been implemented.  There is one
     odd display artifact; lists which are smaller than the browser
     column area have the list justified to the bottom of the column
     versus the top of the column.  This is actually an issue with
     NSMatrix and will be remedied when flip views are implemented.

   * Two important optimizations that speed up the displaying of views
     and flushing of windows have been implemented.  Only the views that
     need display and those that produce visible effects on the screen
     receive the -drawRect: message.  Flushing of windows occurs only in
     rectangles that get displayed not in the whole window.

   * Rotation and scaling of views have been finally implemented.  The
     code requires backend support for changing the state of the
     graphics context accordingly.

   * NSScrollView and NSClipView have been implemented.  The current
     implemented behavior is to call the document view to display the
     exposed region.  Copying on scroll will be supported soon, at least
     on Solaris DPS, where it seems the Postscript language has
     provisions for copying drawn regions of screen.  Hopefully DGS will
     also have this facility by the end of the year.

   * NSScroller has been completely reworked to gain speed by using
     timer events.

   * NSSlider has been implemented.  Thanks to Frank Knobloch for
     supporting this and the NSScrollView implementation.

   * NSBox has been implemented.

   * The library has been ported to work under Solaris with the native
     DPS and the NeXT/Apple's Portable Distributed Objects (PDO)
     environment.

   * The library has been integrated with the makefile package so we now
     benefit from all of the features the makefile package gives us,
     especially the possibility to build shared libraries on various
     systems and having different types (debug and profile) of the
     library compiled at the same time.

   * NSCell is able to continuosly send the action to the target while
     the user is tracking the mouse.

   * Several cleanups and as usual, many bug fixes.

1.56 Noteworthy changes in version '0.3.0'
==========================================

   * Completely reworked the menu class.  The NSMenu class is now
     inherited from NSObject and using the new implementation menus have
     been implemented for the XDPS backend (they have the look and feel
     of the NeXTStep menus!).

   * NSRunLoop has been integrated with NSApplication.  Using this
     capability time events have been implemented to NSEvent class.
     These events allow several improvements in the interaction between
     user and the graphic interface.

   * NSMatrix has been reworked, it is now conforming to the OpenStep
     specification and it knows all the selection modes.  It uses time
     events to enhance the drawing speed during mouse drags.

   * The initial implementation of NSForm has been made although it has
     not been tested yet.

   * NSPrinter has been implemented though it was not throughly tested;
     thanks to Simon Frankau.

   * Configure script has been changed to detect the underlaying
     Foundation library.  The currently supported libraries are
     gnustep-base and libFoundation.

   * Several cleanups have been made in a lot of classes: the
     retain/release policy has been fixed, the cell classes correctly
     implement the NSCopying protocol and many others.

1.57 Noteworthy changes in version '0.2.0'
==========================================

   * Additional NSImage and NSImageRep class work.  Incorporated common
     images for use with controls that were designed by Andrew Lindesay.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColorWell class.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColorList class.

   * Cleaned up the header files and added missing headers, methods,
     categories, and protocols; thanks to Simon Frankau for much of this
     work.  Major reorganization of header files.  Types and constants
     were moved in the files they belong.  Each header file includes
     only the headers it really needs.  Use '@class' to forward class
     definitions instead of including the corresponding class file.

   * Completely reworked the NSFont and NSFontManager classes so that
     NSUserDefaults is used for getting defaults and list of known fonts
     are maintained.

   * Initial implementation of NSCursor class.

   * Almost complete implementation of NSButton and NSButtonCell class.
     Buttons can now display images and/or text, handles all of the
     OpenStep button types and styles.

   * Fill out implementation of NSScroller class.

   * Put in underlying support for optimizing drawing; flushing of
     windows, backing store, and only display when needed.

   * Many bug fixes and minor enhancements.

1.58 Noteworthy changes in version '0.1.1'
==========================================

   * Almost complete implementation of the PXKMenu and PXKMenuCell
     classes.

   * Fill out implementation of NSFont and NSFontManager.

   * Fill out implementation of NSColor including color spaces other
     than RGB. Now maintains the common colors as global variables.

   * Integration with the Display Ghostscript System.  This is mainly
     related to using the header files in the DPSclient library for
     defining the PostScript operator functions.

   * Initial documentation set.

   * Initial implementation of NSImage, NSImageRep, and NSImageRep
     subclass classes based upon work by Adam Fedor.

   * Now requires the TIFF library for reading, writing, and
     manipulating tiff files and images.

1.59 Noteworthy changes in version '0.1.0'
==========================================

   * Integration of the GNUstep X/DPS GUI Backend.  This has finally
     produced a set of core code with can display on X/Windows.  Much of
     the X/Windows code has been written by Pascal Forget
     <pascal@wsc.com> and integration efforts have been lead by Scott
     Christley <scottc@net-community.com>.

   * Some major directory reorganization for the new naming guidelines.
     Headers previously in AppKit and DPSClient directories have been
     moved to gnustep/gui and gnustep/dps directores and symbol links
     are created for the AppKit and DPSClient directories.  This should
     allow both GNUstep and other OpenStep implementations to reside on
     the same machine without conflicts.
