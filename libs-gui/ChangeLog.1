Sat Dec 11 06:55:59 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m ([-mouseDown:]): Send NSPopUpButton 
	action to target.

Sat Dec 11 03:15:12 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	don't send action if there is no action.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m ([-setWindowFrameForAttachingToRect:
 	onScreen:preferredEdge:popUpSelectedItem:]): Implemented (but
 	preferredEdge implementation still missing).  ([-trackWithEvent:]):
 	If the menu is a popup menu, don't unhighlight item when closing
 	(used internally by the popup button code to know which item was
 	selected without interfering with the normal target-action operation).
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m ([-initWithFrame:pullsDown:]): Removed
 	notification center code; set the pullsDown flag. ([-_popup:]):
 	Removed. ([-mouseDown:]): Rewritten. ([-selectItem:]): Fixed
 	bug/typo. ([-removeItemWithTitle:]): Fixed bug/typo.
  	([-addItemsWithTitles:]): Fixed bug/typo.
  	([-insertItemWithTitle:atIndex:]): Fixed bug/typo.
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m ([-attachPopUpWithFrame:inView:]):

  	([-insertItemWithTitle:atIndex:]): Changed setting of item's 
	target and action.
	* core/gui/Headers/AppKit/NSMenu.h: Removed declaration of 
	unimplemented -initWithPopUpButton:
	* Headers/AppKit/NSPopUpButton.h: Updated.  
	* Headers/AppKit/NSPopUpButtonCell.h: Added copyright, protected 
	from multiple inclusions.

Thu Dec  9 05:47:09 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m ([-runModalForDirectory:path:filename]),
	([-ok:]), ([-cancel:]): There was a nice bug here: when the panel
 	was aborted, NSOKButton was returned!  The reason is that by
 	chance NSRunAbortedResponse == NSOKButton (they are defined in two
 	different enums).  I changed the way we handle return codes; now
 	the panel returns NSCancelButton on abort.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSSavePanel.h: Added ivar _OKButtonPressed.

Thu Dec  9 03:12:16 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSMatrix.m ([-keyDown:]): Trivial implementation to allow
 	ESC to abort the save panel, method still to implement.

Wed Dec  8 14:59:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSWindow.m: Added new ivar for window view and a
	boolean to say whether the window has been opened (ordered in) since
	it was created or closed.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: Use ivar for window view so that the
	([NSView -removeFromSuperview]) method will work for a window
	content view.  Add code so that windows are not added to the app
	window menu until they are first ordered in.  Also ensure that
	windows are removed from that menu (and run loop performers are
	cancelled) when a window is closed.

Tue Dec  7 21:30:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSColor.m: Implemented ([-isEqual:])
	* Source/NSImage.m: Fix so any cache is ok if the image rep is opaque.

1999-12-07  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSColorWell.m: Added ([+cellClass]) to set cell class to
	NSActionCell so that setTarget: and setAction: methods at least
	don't raise an exception.  Modified ([-drawRect:]) to conform to
	OpenStep 4.2 behavior. (Patch from Jonathan Gapen
	<jagapen@offroad.chem.wisc.edu>).

	* Source/NSColor.m (-set): Set the alpha coverage.

	the selected filename.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: Encode/decode top-left point of window for
	positioning.

Fri Dec  3 11:34:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: ([-updateWindowsItem:]) modified to show
	document state image with new menus.
	([-changeWindowsitem:title:filename:]) updated to understand filename
	format and discard path info.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: Implement ([-setNeedsDisplayForItemAtIndex:])
	and fixed ([-itemRemoved:]) to update the highlighted item properly
	and avoid a crash.

	* Source/NSWindow.m: ([-setTitle:]), ([-setRepresentedFilename:]),
	([-setTitleWithRepresentedFilename:]), ([-setMiniwindowTitle:])

Fri Dec  3 05:21:40 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSTableColumn.m ([-setWidth:]): Tiny changing.

 	documentation for GSHbox, GSVBox, GSTable.  

Thu Dec  2 17:02:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSView.m: ([-displayRectIgnoringOpacity:]) and
	([-displayIfNeededInRectIgnoringOpacity:]) - very tricksy fix so that
	views are still marked as needing display if any of their subviews
	need displaying (though the invalid rectangle may be zeroed if all
	the stuff at this level has been drawn).

Thu Dec  2 11:00:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: ([-trackWithEvent:]) Removed spurious code
	that caused the bug of submenus being closed when you click on them!
	Sumbenus should only be closed at the end of a drag operation or if
	you click on their corresponding item in the parent menu.

Thu Dec  2  8:23:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSImage.m: Use opacity values from image reps to cache more

 	possible.  Mouse events to be implemented after NSTableView works.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSTableColumn.h: Added copyright, updates.
	* Source/NSTableColumn.m: Rewritten nearly everything, class now 
 	finished, but not tested.

Wed Dec  1 14:55:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSColor.m: Fixed a few transparency bugs in system colors.
	* Source/NSImage.m: Caching rewrite - using NSCachedImageRep - works
	with xgps, but probably not xdps.  There are two global variables to
	control this -
	1. NSImageDoesCaching
	To turn caching on - when an image is drawn it is cached, if it is
	redrawn with the same background color set (excluding transparent)
	then the cached version is used.
	2. NSImageForceCaching
	To force the cache to be used irrespective of the background color.

Wed Dec  1 11:55:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSWindow.m: Removed spurious setNeedsDisplay when changing
	the contentView of a window - it's up to the programmer to do that.
	* Source/NSView.m: Removed many spurious setNeedsDisplay calls when
	altering the view hierarchy - it's up to the programmer to do a
	single call at the end of the work.

Wed Dec  1  8:27:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Applied and modified/rewrote patch by Jonathan Gapen

	([NSImage -isFlipped]): Implemented.
	NOTE: NSImage not updated to respect flipped setting.

	* Source/NSCachecImageRep.m: Improve initialisation and added
	partial implementations (no scaling) for ([-drawAtPoint:]) and
	([-drawInRect:]) - the superclass versions didn't work due to
	current state of gstate management.

Mon Nov 29 17:23:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMatrix.m: Memory bounds error fixed.
	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m: use any supplied filetype as denoting a file
	package for the purposes of differentiating between packages and
	directories.  Also - better fix for selecting directories when
	multiple selection is allowed.

Mon Nov 29 11:43:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSBundle.m: rewrite with new nib loading method.

Sun Nov 28 19:37:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m: ([-filenames]) fix to handle multiple

	to keep track of which window is key/main. Handle making window
	key and ordering front in modal sessions.

Sat Nov 20  6:56:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: Implemented ([-initDefaults]) to set window level

	all useful MacOS X Server changes.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: ditto.

Sun Nov 14  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	Huge improvements of NSTextField and related code.  
		
	Fix for nil target:
	* Source/NSApplication.m ([-sendAction:to:from:]): Deal with nil 
	targets as per spec.
	
	Corrected NSControl's delegate stuff: 
	* Headers/AppKit/NSControl.h: Moved methods 'implemented by the
 	delegate' from the class interface to an informal protocol
 	definition.
	* Source/NSControl.m: Removed implementation, which was nearly
 	void anyway, of 'methods implemented by delegate'.  They should be 
 	implemented by the delegate, not by the control.

	Fix in NSControl:
	* Source/NSControl.m ([-setStringValue:]): Abort editing, if any, 
	before setting the value.
	
	Little fix in NSCell to allow abort/checking of entered text:
	* Source/NSCell.m ([-endEditing:]): Do not set the cell's string
 	value to the text.  This should be done by the delegate specified 
	in editWithFrame:inView:editor:delegate:event: upon receiving 
	the -textDidEndEditing: message.

	Fix to make setSelectable/setEditable work:
	* Source/NSCell.m ([-setUpFieldEditorAttributes:]): set
 	editability/selectability of text object.

	Fixed and simplified treating of border during editing; also, 
	do not invoke setUpFieldEditorAttributes: in the cell; this 
	has to be done by the control: 
	* Source/NSCell.m ([-editWithFrame:inView:editor:delegate:event:]), 
	([-selectWithFrame:inView:editor:delegate:start:length:]): Invoke 
	cell's drawingRectForBounds: and other minor fixes.

	Added full NSTextField's delegate support; added real RETURN, TAB,
 	Shift+TAB support; tons of fixes; major rewriting of much of
 	NSTextField:
	* Headers/AppKit/NSTextField.h: Prefixed ivars with underscore, 
	added ivar _text_object.
	* Source/NSTextField.m ([-abortEditing]), ([-currentEditor]),
	([-validateEditing]): Implemented. 
	([-keyDown:]): Removed. 
	([-acceptsFirstResponder]), ([-becomeFirstResponder]), 
	([-mouseDown:]), ([-selectText:]), ([-setDelegate:]), 
	([-textShouldEndEditing:]), ([-textShouldBeginEditing:]), 
	([-textDidEndEditing:]), ([-textDidChange:]), 
	([-textDidBeginEditing:]): Completely rewritten, often from scratch.
	
	* Source/NSTextField.m, Source/NSSecureTextField.m: Standardized
 	initialization.

	Cleaned up NSText delegate stuff and fixed some nasty bugs during
 	the work:
	* Source/NSText.m: Removed implementation of methods 'implemented
 	by the delegate'.  Moved the code around where needed.

	Implemented method missing in NSWindow.
	* Source/NSWindow.m ([NSWindow -endEditingFor:]): Implemented.
	
	Added in NSSavePanel support for editing the file name in the
 	textfield:
	* Source/NSSavePanel.m ([NSSavePanel -_initWithoutGModel]): 
	Set self as delegate to _form; 
	([NSSavePanel -controlTextDidEndEditing:]): New method.

Fri Nov 12  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* NSBrowser.m: [GSBrowserTitleCell] updated ivar draw_background
	to the new name _draws_background.
	
Fri Nov 12 12:02:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMatrix.m: ([-setCellClass:]) was calling methodForSelector
	when it should have been instanceMethodForSelector.

Fri Nov 12 11:53:52 1999  Lyndon Tremblay  <ltremblay@mezzanine.xnot.com>

	* NSBrowser.m: Removed access to unused variable `draw_background',
	which prevented successful compile.
	
Fri Nov 12  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>
		
	NSTextFieldCell made OpenStep compliant; this class is finished.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSTextFieldCell.h Clean up.  Removed some useless
 	ivars, prefixed names of remaining ones with underscores; removed
 	useless methods.
	* Source/NSTextFieldCell.m: Cleaned up completely, fixed,
 	simplified, removed lot of useless stuff, checked for compliance.
	* Source/NSTextField.m, Source/NSTableHeaderCell.m: microscopic
 	trivial updates to keep in sync with NSTextFieldCell.
        			
Thu Nov 11  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSText.m Manually reformatted the whole code.

	* Source/NSText.m ([-acceptsFirstResponder]),
 	([-resignFirstResponder]), ([-becomeFirstResponder]): Rewritten to
 	deal correctly with delegate.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSText.h: Added enumeration of important unicodes.

	Improved interaction of cells with text field editors, better
 	support for fonts, colors when editing:
	* Source/NSCell.m
 	([-editWithFrame:inView:editor:delegate:event:]): Fixes (eg
 	vertical position of rect used for drawing, display text editor, 
	call setUpFieldEditorAttributes:).
	([-selectWithFrame:inView:editor: delegate:start:length:]): Fixes
 	(eg don't make the text object first responder before having put
 	it in the view tree; added selection of the range) [untested].
	* NSCell.m ([-setUpFieldEditorAttributes:]): First implementation.
	* Source/NSTextFieldCell.m ([-setUpFieldEditorAttributes:]):
 	First implementation.

Tue Nov  9  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSBrowser.m ([NSBrowser -setPath:]): Tidied, and fixed
 	code which had been broken by the recent fix to [NSMatrix -cells].

	within a matrix - use plain C arrays for holding the objects and
	cache method implementations for creating new cells.  Also make GC
	aware for some future date when we can use GC.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSMatrix.h: ivar changes for rewrite.
	* Source/NSCell.m: Updated to notice changes in system colors,
	also optimised a little by caching some classes.

Sat Oct 30  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	Still work in progress, but this is a first preview 
	of the new NSSavePanel, NSOpenPanel.  I am aiming at 
	making these classes fully compliant soon. 
	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m: Completely rewritten.  A lot of
	functionalities which were missing have now been implemented.
	* Source/NSSavePanel.m: Rewritten a lot of parts, mainly:
	allocation/initialization (but could not test the gmodel loading),
	browser delegate methods, appearance (the gmodel has not been
	updated -- when we have IM it will be very easy), and with the specs
	in hand I checked all the code and did a lot of improvements.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSOpenPanel.h: Changed ivars.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSSavePanel.h: Changed ivars.
	* Model/GMAppKit.m: Added NSOpenPanel.

 	on abort.
	* Source/NSTextField.m ([-keyUp:]): Removed method, useless.
	* Source/NSView.m ([-keyDown:]): Removed method.  Moved the code
	to [NSWindow -keyDown:].
	* Source/NSView.m ([-keyUp:]): Removed method, useless.
	* Source/NSWindow.m ([-keyDown:]): Implemented method.  Added
	Escape support.

Sat Oct  9  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>
	
	* Source/NSButton.m ([-keyDown:]): Perform a click if  
	the key is SPACE or ENTER. 
	* Source/NSCell.m ([-performClick:]): Completely rewritten.
	* Source/NSView.m ([-previousValidKeyView]),
 	([-nextValidKeyView]): fix to avoid an infinite loop.

1999-10-09    <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Model/GMAppKit.m ([NSPopUpButton -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): 
	decode itemArray as an array.

	* Source/GNUmakefile: Move installed headers to gnustep/AppKit
	* Model/GNUmakefile: Likewise.

1999-10-08    <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Model/GMAppKit.m ([NSPopUpButton -encodeWithModelArchiver:]):
	Encode frame.

Fri Oct  8  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

        Implementation of key view loop.

 	_previousKeyView.  Added prototypes for the new methods implemented
	in NSView.m.
	* Model/GMAppKit.m ([NSView -encodeWithModelArchiver:]),
	([NSView -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): Updated for new ivars
 	_nextKeyView, _previousKeyView.
	* Source/NSView.m ([-dealloc]): Remove references to the view in
 	_nextKeyView and _previousKeyView.

	* Source/NSView.m ([-setNextKeyView:]): implemented method.
	([-nextValidKeyView]): implemented method.  ([-nextValidKeyView]):
	implemented method.  ([-setPreviousKeyView:]): implemented method.
	([-previousValidKeyView]): implemented method.
	([-previousValidKeyView]): implemented method.
	* Source/NSView.m ([NSView -keyDown:]): implemented method
	to process TAB/SHIFT+TAB. ([NSView -keyUp:]): idem.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: ([-selectPreviousKeyView:]): implemented method.
	([-selectKeyViewFollowingView:]): implemented method.
	([-selectNextKeyView:]): implemented method.
	([-selectKeyViewPrecedingView:]): implemented method.

	Fix, mainly useful for custom control subclasses:
	* Model/GMAppKit.m ([NSControl -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): If the
 	encoded cell is nil, create a new one (of the class associated
 	with the type of NSControl being decoded).  This is needed for
 	NSControl custom subclasses encoded through IMCustomView.
	([NSMatrix -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): Do not set delegate if
	nil.

Tue Oct  5  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Model/IMConnectors.m ([IMOutletConnector -establishConnection]):
 	Fixed bug which would get some method names wrong, as for example
 	@"setInspectorview:" instead of @"setInspectorView:", due to an
 	error in calling NSString's -capitalizedString.

Mon Oct  4  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

        Implementation of 'initial first responder' stuff for NSWindow:
	* Headers/AppKit/NSWindow.h: New instance variable
 	_initial_first_responder
	* Source/NSWindow.m: ([-dealloc]), ([-initDefaults]),
 	([-encodeWithCoder:]), ([-decodeWithCoder:]): updated to take
 	account for the new ivar _initial_first_responder.
	* Model/GMAppKit.m ([NSWindow -encodeWithModelArchiver:]): Added
 	initialFirstResponder
 	([NSWindow -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): idem
	([NSPanel -encodeWithModelArchiver:]): idem
	([NSPanel -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): idem
	([NSSavePanel -encodeWithModelArchiver:]): idem
	([NSSavePanel -initWithModelUnarchiver:]): idem
	* Source/NSWindow.m ([-setInitialFirstResponder:]): implemented method.
  	([-initialFirstResponder]): implemented method.
	* Source/NSWindow.m ([-display]): If there is no first_responder,
 	set it to _initial_first_responder (if non-nil).

	Minor fixes:
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Added missing AppKit/AppKitExceptions.h
	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m ([+openPanel]): Set defaults after creating.

Tue Sep 28  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSBrowser.m Fixed bug: ([-mouseDown:]): New method with a
	void implementation (to prevent the original NSControl's method
	from being ever executed).

Mon Sep 27  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m ([+openPanel]): use NSSavePanel's new 
	_initWithoutGModel method if loading of gmodel fails.  
	For now, use always the safer _initWithoutGModel.

Thu Sep 23  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): Clean
 	up and bug fix for cells without image.  Leaf cells (and branch cells
	with a nil branchimage) should now draw correctly.
	* Source/NSSavePanel.m ([-_initWithoutGModel]): new method meant
 	to allow the panel run even without a gmodel, or when loading of
 	the gmodel fails. ([-_setDefaults]): set the title to "Save".
	([+savePanel]): Use always the safer _initWithoutGModel for now.
	RFM - tidied a little, adding releases for subviews etc (even though
	the save panel may never be destroyed).

Tue Sep 21  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSBrowser.m ([-selectedColumn]): fix: ignore unloaded
	columns when searching the currently selected one. 
	* Source/NSMatrix.m ([-drawCellAtRow:column:]): fix: added forgotten
	lockFocus/unlockFocus.
	* Source/NSMatrix.m ([-resizeWithOldSuperviewSize:]): New method
	implementing the prescribed autoresizing behaviour according to
	autosizesCells.

1999-09-21  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m (-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:): Put
	arrow at extreme right of cell (patch from Tim Bissell
	<tim_bissell@yahoo.co.uk>).

	* Source/NSButtonsCell.m (-performClick:) Remove (duplicate of
	NSCell method).

Tue Sep 15  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	(NB. The above date reflects submission of the patch - sorry I didn't
	commit it until 21st Sept - RFM)
	* Source/NSButton.m ([-performClick:]): Removed lock/unlock focus, 
	now done automatically by the cell. 
	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): Lock
	focus in the view during drawing.
	* Source/NSButtonCell.m: ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): Lock
	focus in the view during drawing. ([-drawWithFrame:inView:]):
	idem. 
	* Source/NSButtonCell.m ([-performClick:]): draw in its control_view,
	if it has one, not in the currently focused view.
	* Source/NSCell.m ([-performClick:]): idem.
	* Source/NSCell.m: ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): Lock focus
	in the view during drawing. ([-drawWithFrame:inView:]): idem.
	* Source/NSControl.m ([-initWithFrame:]): invoke +cellClass 
	when creating the new cell.     
	* Source/NSControl.m ([-drawCellInside:]): call the cell's
	drawingRectForBounds: method to get the area to draw. 
	* Source/NSControl.m ([-mouseDown:]): Removed lock/unlock focus
	now done automatically by the cell.
	* Source/NSImageCell.m: ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): Lock
	focus in the view during drawing. ([-drawWithFrame:inView:]): idem.
	* Source/NSMatrix.m ([-highlightCell:atRow:column:]): lock focus
	during drawing of background.
	* Source/NSMatrix.m ([-_mouseDownNonListMode:]): Removed lock
	focus now done by the cells. ([-mouseDown:]): idem. ([-keyDown:]):
	idem.
	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m ([-drawWithFrame:inView:]): Lock focus
	in the view during drawing.
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m ([-drawWithFrame:inView:]): idem.
	* Source/NSSliderCell.m ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): idem. 
	* Source/NSTableHeaderCell.m ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]):
	idem.
	* Source/NSTextFieldCell.m: ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): idem.

Mon Sep 20  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSView.m ([-setFrameSize:]): use zero width or height if
	the width or height of the argument is negative, but don't crash
	the app. ([-setFrame:]): idem.
	Modified by RFM to apply to all other cases of checking view size
	and also to add debug logging for all those cases.

Mon Sep 20  1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSPanel.m: Remove unnecessary -center messages.
	* Source/NSApplication.m: Add explanatory comment about centering.

Mon Sep 20  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSApplication.m ([-runModalForWindow:]): Automatically
	invoke [-center] on the window, if the window is a panel.
	(following the spec for NSWindow's center method.)  
	* Source/NSSavePanel.m ([-runModalForDirectory:path:filename]):
	Simplified, removed some useless comands:  NSApplication's 
	-runModalForWindow: already both centers and
	makeKeyAndOrderFronts the panel, as required by the specs.

Sat Sep 18  1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSView.m: Applied N. Pero's fix for lockFocus.

Sat Sep 18  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSFormCell.m ([-initTextCell:]): Follow the doc: init
	bezeled. ([-drawWithFrame:inView:]): Tiny fix to have some space
	between title and text.	([-cellSize]): New method

Thu Sep 16  8:38:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m: Fix for positioning of leaf images.

Thu Sep 16  7:11:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSBrowser.m: ([-setPath:]) ensure column zero is loaded - patch
	from Tim Bissell.

1999-09-13  Pedro Ivo Andrade Tavares  <ptavares@iname.com>

        * NSScreen.m: added the Mac OS X messages -visibleFrame: and
        -supportedWindowDepths. The messages are not generalized right now.

1999-09-14  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCell.m ([NSCell
	-trackMouse:inRect:ofView:untilMouseUp:]): Remove setNeedsDisplay
	(bug reintroduced again inadvertantly).

1999-09-08  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Model/GMAppKit.m: Undef implementation of NSPopUpButton.
	* Model/IBClasses.h: Interface for NSMenuTemplate.
	* Model/IBClasses.m: Add code to retain NSMenuTemplate if it's
	associated with a NSPopUpButton (This seems like a hack - nib2gmodel
	may not be correctly connecting NSPopUpButton with its NSMenu).

1999-09-14  David Lazaro Saz  <khelekir@encomix.es>

	* Source/NSScrollView.m ([NSScrollView -drawRect:]): Corrected problem
	with the vertical black line of a scrollview being displaced 1 pixel
	down.

Tue Sep 14  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSButton.m: ([-drawRect:]): Removed method. 
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m ([-drawRect:]): Corrected method.  
	It should not draw the cell in its argument rect, but in its bounds. 
	* Source/NSTextField.m: ([-drawRect:]): Removed method. 

1999-09-14  David Lazaro Saz  <khelekir@encomix.es>

	* Source/NSButtonCell.m: NeXT look-alike changes
	([-drawingRectForBounds:]): Made NSButton a special case.  The
	drawing rect is calculated in a different way than the other
	cell types.
	([-cellSize]): Added changes that take the above into account and
	removed extra inner border if only there's an image to draw and
	no text.
	([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): Added a nice translation
	effect when pushing a button.

Mon Sep 13  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSImageView.m ([-setImage:]): Added update of the cell. 
	([-setImageAlignment:]): idem.	
	([-setImageScaling:]): idem.
	([-setImageFrameStyle:]): idem. 
	* Source/NSView.m ([-encodeWithCoder:]): added encoding of the
	autoresizingMask ([-initWithCoder:]): added decoding of the same
	variable.
	
Sun Sep 12  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

        * Source/NSView.m ([-resizeWithOldSuperviewSize:]): Fixed
        difficult bug hunted for months: removed floor() used in the
        middle of the computation of widths and heights.  Widths and
        heights are float, and must not to be arbitrarily rounded to
        integers in the middle of a computation.  This bug would cause
        obscure, very little, misalignment in various views after resize.
        The misalignments could become appreciable and ugly after repeated
        resizes.

Sun Sep 12  1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

        * Source/NSImageCell.m ([-cellSize]): added method.
        ([-drawingRectForBounds:]): added method.
        ([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): usual bug fix (see Sep 11).

1999-09-11  David Lazaro Saz <khelekir@encomix.es>

       	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSGraphics.h: Changed parameter declaration
	of bordered rectangle drawing functions to conform with MacOS X
	specs.

1999-09-11  Michael Hanni   <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: many small fixes and optimizations for quicker
	display. In addition several small fixes which should improve
	functionality as well as usablity.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSHelpManager.m: a small bugfix to allow for compilation.

1999-09-11  Pedro Ivo Andrade Tavares  <ptavares@iname.com>

        * NSResponder.m ([NSResponder -helpRequested:]): 
        Now the application exits context help mode regardless of whether
        help was shown or not. Without it, the app would do nothing while
        the user didn't click on a control with help, and would appear
	broken.
        * NSHelpManager.m
        ([NSBundle -contextHelpForKey:]): implemented. See below.
        ([NSApplication -showHelp:]): implemented. See below.
        ([NSHelpManager -contextHelpForObject:]): minor change.

        Context Help for an application is stored in a file called
	Help.plist. Inside it are several dictionaries, each with the
	name of what originally was an RTF or RTFD file. Inside each of
	these dicts, a key called NSHelpRTFContents contains an
	NSArchived NSAttributedString from the original file. NSBundle
	receives the original RTF file name, and retrieves the
	NSAttributedString from this file. Thanks to Richard
        Frith-MacDonald for unearthing the format of Help.plist.

        I've implemented an extension, in that NSBundle also looks inside
	an directory called Help for a file of this name.

        NSApplication -showHelp: asks the workspace to open in the default
        editor a file of name "appname.rtf", or what is in the key 
        GSHelpContentsFile in the Info-gnustep.plist file.

Sat Sep 11 11:20:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSCell.h: Removed ([-_drawImage:inFrame:])
	* Source/NSCell.m: Removed ([-_drawImage:inFrame:])
	* Source/NSButtonCell.m:  Don't use ([-_drawImage:inFrame:])
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m:  Don't use ([-_drawImage:inFrame:])

Sat Sep 11 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSControl.m ([-sizeToFit]): implemented method.  
	* Source/NSCell.m ([-cellSize]): implemented method.
	([-drawingRectForBounds:]): implemented method.
	([-imageRectForBounds:]): implemented method.
	([-titleRectForBounds:]): implemented method.
	([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): bug fix; calculate the drawing
	rect (the cell frame minus the borders) correctly (by invoking
	drawingRectForBounds:).  Previously, xDist was incorrectly used
	instead of the width of the border, and yDist instead of the
	height of the border.
	* NSButtonCell.m ([-drawingRectForBounds:]): implemented method.
	([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): same bug fix as above.
	* NSTextFieldCell.m ([-cellSize]): removed method; it is no longer
	needed.  Now [-cellSize] is inherited from the NSCell class.
	([-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:]): same bug fix as above.

1999-09-10  Carl Lindberg	<Carl.Lindberg@hbo.com>

	* Source/NSDocument.m: new file, implementation.
	* Source/NSDocumentController.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSWindowController.m: ditto.
	* Headers/NSDocument.h
	  Headers/NSDocumentController.h
	  Headers/NSDocumentFrameworkPrivate.h
	  Headers/NSWindowController.h: new.

1999-09-10  Pedro Ivo Andrade Tavares  	<ptavares@iname.com>

        * Source/NSHelpManager.m: new file. See below for an explanation.
        * Headers/AppKit/NSHelpManager.h: new file.
        * Source/GSHelpManagerPanel.h: new file.
        * Source/GSHelpManagerPanel.m: new file, defines the help window
        used by NSHelpManager.
	* Source/NSWindow.m ([NSWindow -sendEvent:]): if we're in context
	help mode, call -helpRequested: instead of -mouseDown.
        * NSResponder.m ([NSResponder -helpRequested:]): if the current
        responder has context help, show it using NSHelpManager; else,
        pass to the next responder.

        These changes and new files implement the NSHelpManager context
	help interface, which is defined on OpenStep 4.1 onward and Mac
	OS X Server.
        To define context help for any responder, call [[NSHelpManager 
        sharedHelpManager] setContextHelp: (an NSAttributedString with the 
        help) forObject: (the responder)]. For the user to see it, call 
        [[NSApplication sharedApplication] activateContextHelpMode] for
	now, and the next time a user clicks on a responder, its help
	will be shown.
        The actiation of the context help mode will be automatic in the
	future.

1999-09-10  Michael Hanni   <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSWindow.m: modifications to allow NSWindowController and
	friends to work happily. Before windowShouldClose completes we
	confer with NSWindowController if we should REALLY close the
	window.
	* Source/NSApplication.m: modifications for NSDocumentController.
	If the delgate doesn't handle openFile: [NSDocumentController
	sharedDocumentController] opens the file.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: fixed a display problem. Tabs on the bottom
	of the view work, but some display niggles remain. (Note: we beat
	Apple on this one, heh.)

Thu Sep  9 1999  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSButtonCell.m: implemented missing method ([-cellSize]).

1999-09-09  Gerrit van Dyk <gerritvd@decillion.net>

	* Headers/NSComboBox.h: Added NSComboBox
	* Headers/NSComboBoxCell.h: Add NSComboBoxCell
	* Headers/AppKit.h: Added NSComboBox,NSComboBoxCell
	* Source/NSComboBox.m: Added NSComboBox.
	* Source/NSComboBoxCell.m: Added NSComboBoxCell
	* Source/GSComboSupport.hm: Private Classes used by ComboBoxes
	* Images/NSComboArrow.tiff: down arrow on comboboxes

1999-09-07  Michael Hanni   <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSTabView.m: some modifications to make tabs on the
	bottom look a little better.
	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: turned off fixParagraphAttributes,
	was causing Text Network to crash. (Most likely my fault.)
	* Source/NSLayoutManager.m: lots of code... nothing exciting.
	* Images/*: somehow I triggered CVS to touch everything in here,
	oops.

Tue Sep  7  6:50:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSScrollView.m: ([-setContentView:]) prohibit illegal settings.
	([-encodeWithCoder:]) and ([-initWithCoder:]) implemented.
	* Model/GMAppKit.m: Fix NSScrollView initialisation to create the
	content-view (NSClipView) as it should.

1999-09-06  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSMatrix: Added missing method ([-sizeToFit]).
	([-deselectAllCells]): do nothing, as in MacOS-X, if mode is
	NSRadioModeMatrix and empty selection is not allowed.
	([-selectCellAtRow:column:]): mark both the cells, newly selected
	and deselected one, as needing redraw, not only the newly selected
	cell.  If row or column is negative, just deselect the currently
	selected cell, as in MacOS-X.

Mon Sep  6  6:37:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSWindow.m: added enable/disable flush fix from dawn.
	* Headers/NSWindow.h: added enable/disable flush fix from dawn.

Fri Sep  3 22:45:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: implemented (untested) most of the
	missing methods, and fixed a few memory leaks.

Thu Sep  2 12:50:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* NSWorkspace.m: Fixes for locating icons in application resources.
	* NSBundleAdditions.m: implemented ([-pathForImageresource:])

Wed Sep  1  9:55:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Added patches from n.pero@mi.flashnet.it to access ivars of
	superclasses directly.  Generated changes for NSClipView.m myself.
	* NSBox.m: (frame)
	* NSClipView.m: (superview, window, bounds)
	* NSMatrix.m: (bounds)
	* NSMenuView.m: (frame, window, bounds)
	* NSPopUpButton.m: (frame, window)
	* NSProgressIndicator   (window, bounds)
	* NSSavePanel.m: (frame)
	* NSScroller.m: (frame)
	* NSScrollView.m: (bounds)
	* NSSlider.m: (bounds)
	* NSSplitView.m: (frame, window, bounds)
	* NSTabView.m: (frame)
	* NSTableView.m: (superview)
	* NSView.m: (superview, autoresizeSubviews)

Wed Sep  1  9:28:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

        * Tools/GNUmakefile.preamble: patch by doko@cs.tu-berlin.de so that
        make_services is linked without the gste-gui library.
	* Tools/make_services.m: minor fixes to get rid of some compiler
	warnings - remove unused variables etc.

Wed Sep  1  9:17:00 1999  n.pero@mi.flashnet.it
	* Source/NSBox.m: (-initWithFrame:) changed default border type to 
	NSGrooveBorder (as in MacOS-X).  Resize content view to fit the box. 
	Turn off autoresizing of subviews. 
	(-setContentViewMargins:) removed the code which resized the content 
	view (as required by MacOS-X specs). 
	(-setFrame:) added method.  It resizes also the content view when 
	the box is resized, as required by MacOS-X specs. 
	(-setFrameSize:) idem. 
	(-setFrameFromContentFrame:) Tried to make the GNUstep method compliant 
	with MacOS-X specs.  In particular, the origin of the NSBox has to be 
	changed too, and contentFrame is relative to the superview's coordinate 
	system.
	(-sizeToFit) Tried to make the GNUstep method compliant with MacOS-X 
	specs.  In particular, try the sizeToFit message to the content_view 
	before resizing it; check that the title fits, otherwise make the box 
	bigger to have the title displayed; modified slightly the loop to give 
	correct answer in case the min of the origin's of the subviews is
	positive; keep better care of the fact that frames are not expressed
	always in the same coordinate system. 

Sun Aug 22 11:52:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSView.m: ([-viewWillMoveToWindow:]) fixed to call method
	in subviews when new window is nil.

1999-08-22  Gerrit van Dyk <gerritvd@decillion.net>

	* Headers/NSProgressIndicator.h
		  AppKit.h: Added ProgressIndicator
	* Source/NSProgressIndicator.m: Added ProgressIndicator. Only
	determinate Indicators works at this stage.

1999-08-21  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSCell.m: lots of fixes to editWithFrame, and fieldEditor
	related methods.
	* Source/NSText.m: caret drawing now works.
	* Source/NSTextField.m: fixes to allow for single click and type
	usage of textFields.
	* Source/NSView.m: fixed bug in viewWillMoveToWindow: which could
	cause an X11 protocol error in the backend.

1999-08-20  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSSlider.m: added missing [self unlockFocus];.
	* Source/NSMenu.m: fixes to sizeToFit and update. This allows you
	to keep the windows and services menus tornoff and when you rerun
	the program these menus will look correct.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: ditto.

1999-08-19  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Headers/NSAttributedString.h
		  NSLayoutManager.h
		  NSTableView.h: modifications, mostly added ivars.
	* Source/NSLayoutManager.m: implemented much code for layout and
	display.
	* Source/NSMenu.m: fixed some nagging problems. tearoffs should
	work almost universally. Positions are saved and restored. If you
	previous position exists for the main menu it goes to the upper
	left corner.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: a few attempts to fix the "move to submenu"
	bugs.
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: many bug fixes and new implementations.
	Too many to list here.
	* Source/NSTableView.m: more code implemented, though I wouldn't
	recommend trying to use this class. :-)
	* Source/NSText.m: debugging code to help pinpoint which methods
	can be used in NSTextView and which have to be overridden.
	* Source/NSTextStorage.m: properly assigns itself to its
	layoutManager.
	* Source/NSTextView.m: more code additions to coincide with the
	new NSLayoutManager.

1999-09-07  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version: 0.6.0

	* Source/NSLayoutManager.m: Change NSLog to NSDebugLLog
	* Source/NSText.m: Likewise.
	* Source/NSTextContainer.m: Likewise.
	* Source/NSTextField.m: Likewise.
	* Source/NSTextStorage.m: Likewise.
	* Source/NSTextView.m: Likewise.

	* Source/NSBox.m ([NSBox -initWithCoder:]): Remember to set the
	content view.
	* Source/NSFontPanel.m ([NSFontPanel -setPanelFont:isMultiple:]): 
	ASSIGN panel_font (e.g. retain it).
	(-initWithCoder:): Likewise.
	* Source/NSText.m ([NSText -initWithFrame:]): Retain default_font.
	(-initWithCoder:): Likewise.

1999-09-07  Michael Hanni   <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

        * Source/NSInterfaceStyle.m: added support for
        GSWindowMakerInterfaceStyle.
        * Headers/NSInterfaceStyle.h: added enum
        GSWindowMakerInterfaceStyle.
        * Source/NSMenu.m: implemented NSInterfaceStyle based window maker
        like menus. i.e. they line up with the menu item selected.
        try 'defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSMenuInterfaceStyle
             GSWindowMakerInterfaceStyle'

1999-09-05  Michael Hanni   <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: fix nagging bug reported by Gregory John
	Casamento  <gcasamen@my-deja.com>.
	* Source/NSWorkspace.m: reverted an erroneous patch I applied.

1999-09-04  Nicola Pero  <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: added missing method ([-_rightMouseDisplay]) 
	with a void implementation.  In future, it should be given 
	a complete implementation, or removed.  At present, the method 
	is only called by NSResponder.

1999-09-04  Michael Hanni   <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Model/GMAppKit.m: patch from Tim Bissell
	<tim.bissell@dresdnerkb.com> adds proper decoding/encoding of
	NSButtonCell titles.
	* Source/NSCell.m: updated copy from HEAD.
	* Source/NSText.m: ditto + minor additions.
	* Source/NSView.m: patch to prevent X crashes.

	* Source/NSSlider.m: patch to add missing unlockFocus.
 	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m: patch from Tim Bissell
	<tim.bissell@dresdnerkb.com> set NSBrowerCell to be initially not
	editable (mimcs OS 4.2 behaviour).
	* Source/NSWorkspace.m: added patch from Tim Bissell
	<tim.bissell@dresdnerkb.com> which adds special GNUstep
	functionality to NSWorkspace (for FileViewer.app).
	* Headers/NSWorkspace.h: added method definitions for additions by
	Tim Bissell <tim.bissell@dresdnerkb.com>

Thu Sep  2 16:42:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

        * NSWorkspace.m: Trivial fix to pass app when opening files.
        * GSServicesManager.m: Fix to send open commands to app delegate
        rather than to application object itsself.
        * NSApplication.m: Fix to recognise file open request on commandline.

Thu Sep  2  9:50:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* NSWorkspace.m: Attempted fix for locateApplicationBinary and tidied.
	Modified fix for getting file icons of directories where the extension
	is meaningless.  Look for .dir.tiff as well.

1999-09-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSFont.m ([NSFont -initWithCoder:]): Get the real font
	from the fontname.
	* Source/NSView.m ([NSFont -initWithCoder:]): Initialize frameMatrix
	and other matrices. (Fixes suggested by GerritVD@decimax.com).
		
Mon Aug 30 15:53:41 1999  Martin Man  <Martin.Man@seznam.cz>

        * Headers/AppKit/NSPopUpButton.h: 
        * Source/NSPopUpButton.m: setTitle's return type changed from int
        to void to conform openstep specs.

Wed Sep  1  9:28:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Tools/GNUmakefile.preamble: patch by doko@cs.tu-berlin.de so that
	make_services is linked without the gstep-gui library.

Wed Sep  1  9:25:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSBox.m: set default border type to NSGrooveBorder as
	suggested by n.pero

Tue Aug 31 10:45:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Fixes to remove hard-coded colors from gui.  I'm not sure this is
	entirely correct - in places where we expect to display white text on
	a dark-gray background, I've used windowFrameTextColor and
	controlShadowColor, since the MacOS-X documentation doesn't seem to
	specify anything exactly for this.
	* NSBrowser.m: use windowFrameTextColor for title text and
	controlShadowColor for background.
	* NSClipView.m: (-init) use controlColor for default background.
	* NSColorWell.m: (-drawRect:) use controlColor for background.
	* NSFontPanel.m: use windowFrameTextColor for title text and
        controlShadowColor for background.
	* NSMatrix.m: Use controlBackgroundColor for backgrounds.
	* NSMenu.m: ([NSMenuWindowTitleView drawRect:]) use windowFrameColor
	and windowFrameTextColor.
	* NSMenuItemCell.m: use selectedMenuItemColor or controlColor for
	background, and use selectedMenuItemTextColor, controlTextColor, or
	disabledControlTextColor for text.
	* NSPopUpButtonCell.m: use selectedMenuItemColor or controlColor for
        background, and use selectedMenuItemTextColor, controlTextColor for
        text.
	* NSSplitView.m: ([-initWithFrame:]) use controlShadowColor for the
	divider, and controlBackgroundColor for background.
	* NSTabViewItem.m: use controlBackgroundColor.
	* NSTableHeaderCell.m: use controlShadowColor for header.
	* NSTableView.m: use gridColor for the grid.

1999-08-29  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSCell.m ([NSCell -trackMouse:inRect:ofView:untilMouseUp:]): 
	Remove setNeedsDisplay, which was causing button to disappear when
	mouse left bounds.

1999-08-23  Pedro Ivo Andrade Tavares  <ptavares@iname.com>

        * Source/NSApplication.m: fixed a bug where it would ask if it should
        terminate when a panel over the main window was closed.

Fri Aug 27  8:02:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

        Patch from Nicola Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it> 
        * Source/NSBox.m: Fix setFrameFromContentFrame: for zero rect frame.

Wed Aug 25 09:42:05 1999  Martin Man  <Martin.Man@seznam.cz>

	* Source/NSWindow.m ([NSWindow -setFrameTopLeftPoint:]): Corrected
	positioning of window's top left point. X coordinate was ignored
	and Y coordinate was computed in wrong way.

Thu Aug 26  5:07:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

        Patch from Niico Pero <n.pero@mi.flashnet.it> modified to use
        controlDarkShadowColor rather than blackColor.
        * Source/NSBox.m: draw line borders in correct color.
        * Source/NSCell.m ditto
        * Source/NSScrollView.m: ditto
        * Source/NSTabView.m: ditto

1999-08-24  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSPanel.m (NSRun...AlertPanel): Change window mapping to
	orderFrontRegardless so panel comes up even when app is not active.

1999-08-22  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Documentation/gnustep-gui.tmpl.texi: New with GNUstep specific
	documentation.

Sat Aug 21  8:00:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSApplication: ([-setMainMenu:]) close the old main menu
	(if any) and display the new one if the app is active.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSWindow.h: Changed ivar to support flush enable
	* Source/NSWindow.m: Fixed frame sizing to permit setting of frame
	beyond min/max size.  Fixed bug in enable/disable flush.

1999-08-12  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Model/GMArchiver.m (-encodeObject:withName:): Don't encode
	object if there is a replacement object for it. (Patch from Benhur
	Stein <Benhur-de-Oliveira.Stein@imag.fr>)

1999-08-10  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSClipView.m (-setBoundsOrigin:): Remove
	window update.
	* Source/NSScroller.m (-_floatValueForMousePoint:): 
	Better position calculations.
	(-trackScrollButtons:): Various improvements. 
	* Source/NSWindow.m (-setViewsNeedDisplay:): Rewrite to automatically
	update in event loop.
	* Source/NSTextView.m (-drawRect:): Minor fix. (Patches and
	suggestions from  Benhur Stein <Benhur-de-Oliveira.Stein@imag.fr>). 

Mon Aug  9 13:57:48 1999  Adam Fedor  <fedor@ultra.doc.com>

	* NSGraphicsContext.m (-DPSGetEventMatchingMask:...): Add check
	for NSAppKitDefined and other masks.
	* NSWindow.m (-sendEvent:): Get dragInfo object fix.

1999-08-06  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* many files: Update FSF mailing address.
	
Fri Aug  6 15:07:29 1999  Adam Fedor  <fedor@ultra.doc.com>

	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSDragging: Corrected method name.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: Likewise.

1999-08-03  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: commented out code which did multiple menu
	movement as it was breaking things. Need to rethink that.
	* Headers/NSTableColumn.h
        Headers/NSTableHeaderView.h  
	Headers/NSTableHeaderCell.h 
	Headers/NSTableView.h: added files.
	* Source/GNUMakefile: compile in NSTable classes.

1999-07-31  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: added patch by Pedro Ivo Andrade Tavares
	<ptavares@iname.com> to handle last window/application exit. This
	implementation mimics OpenStep 4.1.

1999-07-30  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: rewrote sections to handle new popupbutton
	code. New initialiser - initWithPopUpButton:. New ivar
	menu_isBeholdenToPopUpButton.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: ditto. removed code that dealt with
	popupbutton. Also fixed bug which disallowed selecting an item if
	you dragged of a popup and dragged back up.
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: complete rewrite. now this class should
	be almost completly MacOSX compliant. For kicks try
	popupbuttons.app in core/Testing to see.
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m: modifications to make NSPopUpButton
	work. Also implemented representedObject as I think it should be.
	Also made popupbutton arrow image work for popups that use images.
	* Source/NSTableColumn.m: fixes to make some things work a little
	better.
	* Source/NSTableView.m: fixes to make things behave. Still doesn't
	compile in, but it is getting there. Modifications will have to
	be made to NSScrollView before we can use this class.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: fixed (- contentRect) for the no tabs case.

	* Images/: added common_UpAndDownArrowSmall.tiff and
	common_DownArrowSmall.tiff for popupbuttons with images in them.

	* Headers/NSMenu.h: mods for changes.
	* Headers/NSPopUpButton.h: ditto.
	* Headers/NSPopUpButtonCell.h: ditto, also changed to inherit from
	NSMenuItemCell.

1999-07-29  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSEvent.h: Add AppKit dragging events.
	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSGraphicsContext.h: Added some internal drag
	methods.
	* Source/NSGraphicsContext.m (-_dragInfo): New method.
	(-_postExternalEvent:): Likewise.

	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSPasteboard.h: Added some internal mime type
	conversions.
	* Source/NSPasteboard.m (-_initMimeMappings): New method.
	(-mimeTypeForPasteboardType:): Likewise.
	(-pasteboardTypeForMimeType:): Likewise.

	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSWindow.h: Added some drag ivars.
	* Source/NSView.m (-dragImage...): Get the shared dragView and
	call it. 
	* Source/NSWindow.m (-sendEvent:): For LeftMouseDown, send
	mouseDown: to view if view is key (even if not first responder).
	Handle AppKit dragging events.

	* Source/NSObjectProtocols.m: New file (Implement informal draggin
	protocols). 

1999-07-27  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: merge in all backend code. All that remains in
	the backend is NSMenuWindow.
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: merged in all backend code. Relies on
	NSMenuWindow now.

1999-07-27  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSTabView.m: added code to allow tabs on the bottom of a
	tabview. Also made the space that the tabs themselves are draw in
	from 20 pixels to 16 (which is the exact space needed.)
	* Images/common_TabDownSelectedLeft.tiff
	common_TabDownSelectedRight.tiff
	common_TabDownSelectedToUnSelectedJunction.tiff
	common_TabDownUnSelectedJunction.tiff
	common_TabDownUnSelectedLeft.tiff
	common_TabDownUnSelectedRight.tiff
	common_TabDownUnSelectedToSelectedJunction.tiff:
	place keeper images for bottom tabs. These really need to be
	redrawn.
	* Source/NSMenu.m: removed isTornOff: from frontend and it is in
	the backend where it should be.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: added code that does quite a bit of the
	transient menu code. Added code to close transients when the mouse
	goes up.

	The event code needs to be finessed so that the transient menu is
	not allowed to remain on screen unless the mouse button stays down.

1999-07-26  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSTableView.m: added much more code to this
	implementation. Almost to the point where it could display
	something useful. Alas, some difficulties remain because the
	linkages between the NSTable* classes is by no means clear.
	* Source/NSTableColumn.m: if the datacell type has not been set
	and is asked for we create a standard NSTextFieldCell.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: implementation is at 90%. All delegate
	messages are sent as required (if possible) and tab selection is
	now by the spec. Also a small optimization in tab selection makes
	sure we don't reselect tabs that are already selected. Also, when
	drawRect is called, if no tab is selected the first tab becomes
	selected. Further, we properly keep the value of the index of the
	currently selected item. I also fixed the drawing code for use
	NSTabView without displaying tabs. The result of this can be seen
	in core/Testing/GNUstepInstaller.app. Tidied (- contentRect) to
	return something a little closer to the full rect.
	* Source/NSMenu.m: redid alot of the insertItem: addItem: methods
	to unify under the one primitive method. Did the same for
	removeItem:. Also added all the rest of the NSMenu notifications:
		NSMenuDidAddItemNotification
		NSMenuDidRemoveItemNotification
		NSMenuDidChangeItemNotification.
	I think we need some setDelegate/delegate methods in here, no?
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: when creating NSPopUpButtonCell's we
	make sure to make set the cell enabled so to better work with
	some of the new menu code. Also added code to post the one
	notification that this class has.
	* Source/externs.m: added references to new NSMenu
	and NSPopUpButton notifications.

1999-07-25  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSTextStorage.m: removed excess calls to
	edited:range:changeInLength. Also changed on line 191 from > to
	>=. Not sure the complete implications, but alas it now works
	correctly.
	* Source/NSAttributedString.m: new file with implementation of
	some needed additions to NSMutableAttributedString.

	Try gstextnetwork.app, you'll see a lot of debug information.
	After that has cleared click twice in the textView and press a
	key. You will see the textStorage buffer. You should see the word
	'eek' close to the top, that would be from a replaceCharacters in
	range edit, and you should also notice that some 500 characters
	are missing from the middle, that would be from the
	deleteCharactersInRange edit. It seems that the text network is
	working slightly on the flip side, now all we need is some
	drawing code to help make sense of all this. ;-)

Sun Jul 25 11:40:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/GSTextStorage.m: Modified ([-setAttributes:range:]) and
	([-replaceCharactersinRange:withString:]) to call
	([-edited:range:changeInLength:) on completion.
	* Source/NSTextStorage.m: likewise.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: make minimum window size 1 by 1.

1999-07-24  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Headers/NSTextView.h: redid ivars.
	* Source/NSTextView.m: complete rewrite. more methods written.
	* Source/GSServicesManager.m: minor temp debug NSlog.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: debug logs.
	* Source/NSText.m: debug logs.
	* Source/NSTextStorage.m: in processEditing: add code to notify
	every layoutManager of editing done in textStorage.
	Also fixed code to return the string. This makes debugging ohh so
	much easier. ;-)

	Look at core/Testing/gstextnetwork.app. That is the text
	application for NSTextView/TextNetwork. Edit.app has been
	modified to use NSText directly and not NSTextView.

1999-07-23  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Model/GMAppKit.m: Added ifndef's to comment out areas of code
	that don't compile on OPENSTEP/MacOSX machines.
	* Model/GMArchiver.m: Likewise.
	* Model/IMConnectors.m (GSSetInstanceVariable): Dummy function
	on non-gstep-base machines.

Fri Jul 23 11:45:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Tools/gpbs.m: In ihandler() reset signal handler.

1999-07-22  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: some fixes to get things to work correctly
	when calling menu item actions. Also autoenable should be working
	a little better.
	In setHighlightedItemIndex: if new item is disabled do not
	highlight or target action.
	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m: drawing fixes for disabled cells.

1999-07-20  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: trackEvent: fixed problems that existed for
	NSPopUpButton. Should now work as desired. However, I believe I
	need to once again rewrite NSPopUp to make proper use of
	setMenu:, that will make the code sharing between NSMenu and
	NSPopUp complete.

	Also documented the event code a little. Interestingly enough by
	doing this I know what needs to be looked at better. Suprise,
	suprise.

1999-07-19  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSTableView.m: very incomplete implementation.
	* Source/NSTableColumn.m: mostly complete NSTableColumn
	implementation.
	* Source/NSTableHeaderView.m: some coding left when NSTableView
	works.
	* Source/NSTableHeaderCell.m: once all is drawing this should be
	corrected.

	None of this is built for good reason. The code is not finished,
	and the interfaces are not written. But committing them to CVS
	makes it much easier for me to develop on the multiple machines I
	use.

	* Source/GSServicesManager.m: removed NSMenuMatrix code. Should
	work properly now.
	* TODO: added the unimplemented classes TODO list.

1999-07-18  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m: removed debug code. Makes
	popupbutton snappy not sloppy. ;-)

Sun Jul 18 16:30:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: When doing sizeToFit, use setContentSize to
	change the size of the window if we have one, rather than changing
	our frame directly.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: When adding a content view - don't set its
	autosizing mask.  In GSWindowView, don't use autosizing to change
	the content view - set it's frame directly instead.

1999-07-17  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSMenuView.h: added new private interface.
	* Headers/gnustep/gui/NSPopUpButton.h: removed NSPopUpButtonMatrix
	and tidied some ivars.
	* Source/NSMenu.m: fixed a few problems.
	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m: likewise.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: added functionality (privately) so this
	class can be used to draw NSPopUpButton. Also made sizeToFit code
	only size the view, not the window.
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: removed NSPopUpButtonMatrix. Rewrote to
	use NSMenuView.
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m: rewrote portions to handle new
	system of NSMenuView.

1999-07-16  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSText.m: add a patch to NSText from Daniel to do some
	pasteboard related stuff. Also added a patch from Peter Rasmussen
	that addressed my hackish NSClipView scrolling code. Still a hack,
	but won't kill NSText if not used in conjunction with a ClipView.

1999-07-15  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSPopupButton.m: if (count) == 0, return early in drawing
	code. This fixes crashes created by Popups created in our gmodels.
	* Source/NSLayoutManager.m: new file from
	jagapen@whitewater.chem.wisc.edu
	* Source/NSTextView.m: initWithFrame: now creates a proper NSText
	network.

Thu Jul 15 18:00:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSView.m: Make sure cursor and tracking rects are converted
	to window coordinate system before installing them.
	Coordinate conversion methods - return unchanged values if the view
	is not in a window.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: Don't convert cursor rects coordinates - done in
	nsview.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSText.h: Fix include order.

Thu Jul 15  6:55:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSAttributedString.h: new file
	* Headers/AppKit/NSStringDrawing.h: Move some stuff to
	NSAttributedString.h
	* Headers/AppKit/AppKit.h: include NSAttributedString.h
	* Source/GSTextStorage.m: new file
	* Source/GNUmakefile: update for new source
	* Source/NSTextStorage.m: Make instances of GSTextStorage
	* Source/externs.m: Add new string constant for text links.

Wed Jul 14 19:18:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/GNUmakefile: Install NSMenuItemCell.h and NSMenuView.h
	* Headers/AppKit/AppKit.h: Add recent class headers.

Wed Jul 14 16:20:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMatrix.m: Modifications to get rid of most internal
	methods and get the list-mode selection by rectangle working.
	* Source/NSView.m: Implemented ([scrollPoint:]) and
	([scrollrectToVisible:]) (based on mGSTEP).  Code probably buggy
	and untested.
	* Source/NSActionCell.m: Minor optimisations.

Tue Jul 13  6:44:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: In ([-runModalSession:]) pay attention to
	([NSWindow worksWhenModal]).

1999-07-12  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: added code to convert anything that conforms to
	<NSMenuItem> into an NSMenuItemCell. Not tested, but should work.
	Also fixed a small bug in -init, it was not returning.

	addItems so they are converted rather than swapped in (in an
	operation which we can not intercede.)

Mon Jul 12  5:40:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m: In ([-runModalForTypes:]) made change
	suggested by Pascal Bourguignon to pass legal arguments.

Sat Jul 10 14:55:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSapplication.m: In ([-init]) made changes suggested by
	Pascal Bourguignon to enable effective sublassing of NSAppklication.

1999-07-9  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSTabView.m: perfected the mouse event work. now clicking
	in the tabs works wonderfully. Now just need to hook up code to
	draw the selected tabs view in the tabview rect.

	[Check out nstabview.app in Testing/, you won't regret it, hehe.]

1999-07-9  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSTabViewItem.h: defined some non-spec methods.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: added event code. you can now select tabs.
	Not perfect yet, but it works (i.e. click around the text.) Also
	fixed image problem with left most tab being selected.
	* Source/NSTabViewItem.m: cache tabrect for quick retrieval.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: removed an extra call to flushwindow.

Fri Jul  9  9:33:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSApplication.h: Removed delegate methods from
	NSApplication, and put them in a protocol instead.  Removed obsolete
	backend method.
	* Source/NSApplication.m: Removed delegate methods.  Removed code
	that intercepted the right mouse button.
	* Source/NSResponder.m: Added code so that the last responder will
	pop-up the main menu if NSRightMouseDown has not been handled.

Tue Jul  6 21:45:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSGraphicsContext.h: Added new method to perform

	* Source/NSWindow.m: Use new method to implement all window
	ordering methods.
	* Model/GMAppKit.m: Remove calls to ([NSWindow -setLevel:]) as these
	have the unwaanted side-effect of ordering the window in to display.

Tue Jul  6 16:55:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: In ([-trackWithEvent:]) fixed indexing bug

1999-07-03  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Source/NSWindow.m: Implement 
	([-dragImage:at:offset:event:pasteboard:source:slideBack:]) by calling
	the mothod of the smae name in the window view.

1999-07-03  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m (-run): Added destroyContext (so we can
	remove backend run method).

	* Source/NSStringDrawing.m (drawRun): Better hack to work around
	DGS bug that fails to flush strings (XDPS backend only).

1999-06-30  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: fixes:

2. Clicking on the menu item that opened a sub-menu should close the
sub-menu again - it doesn't. [FIXED]
5. Menus are not always closed properly at the end of a click and drag -
I'm not sure if you already know about this one. [FIXED]
6. If I drag off the bottom of a menu (or submenu) then release the mouse
button, the app crashes. [FIXED]
[ 7 is fixed in the backend. ]

	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m: paper-bag-over-the-head-goof:
	keyEquivalents are now drawn. How did I miss those?

1999-06-29  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSMenu.m: complete rewrite. Some work still required to
	finish implementing obscure MacOSX methods, but otherwise functional.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: new file. Implementation of MacOSX menu
	view class. Most classes implemented to provide basic
	functionality. Some work required in event code to "forward"curse
	to close/deselect menus in one case. I'll fix this ASAP.
	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m: new file. Implementation complete, plus
	modifications to allow its use as an <NSMenuItem>.
	* Source/*.m: compilation fixes.

Sun Jun 27  7:50:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	jagapen@whitewater.chem.wisc.edu

1999-06-23  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSText.m: tweaked - sizeToFit and now scrollbars are
	correctly positioned. Furthermore down arrow will move you down
	through text in Edit.app (up arrow does too, but the algo doesn't
	work for it so its dead.)
	* Source/NSTabViewItem.m: remove top line drawing.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: add top line drawing.

1999-06-22  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSText.m: new file from Daniel. Modifications to allow it
	to work with GNUstep. Plus multiple hacks to make it work with
	NSTextField and NSTextView better.
	* Source/NSTextView.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSCell.m: modifications to editWithFrame:::: so our field
	editor is a little better lined up. Plus fieldEditor gets our
	mouseDown: event. Fixed flicker, I think.

	TODO: 
	* fix Caret. Without an insertion marker its hard to see. :-)
	* fix buffer for using a fieldEditor in a cell. Possibly modify
	  NSTextFieldCell so it doesn't draw text directly abutting the
	  side?

1999-06-21  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSText.m: a bunch of little tweaks. Will document today.
	However as a consequence hitting return in Edit.app properly
	moves lines down whereas before it lost lines.
	* Source/NSCell.m: - editWithFrame:inView:editor:delegate:event: 
	Now puts fieldEditor in windows contentView rather than in the
	cell. Debugging messages and red cell splash kept in for the
	moment as debugging of NSTextField* continues.

1999-06-20  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Images/common_TabSelectedLeft.tiff

	common_TabUnSelectedRight.tiff: all tiffs needed to draw NSTabs.
	* Images/common_3DArrowDown.tiff: for NSPopUp in pulldown mode.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: lots of work on drawing. Should draw correct
	in almost all cases. However, without event code I can't test it
	yet.
	* Source/NSTabViewItem.m: drawing. still need to move the drawing
	of the top line out of this and move it into NSTabView's drawRect.
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m: moved all backend code to frontend.

1999-06-20  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: hooked up all the actions and targets
	now works for popup, haven't finished pulldown yet.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: now draws the view correctly for all cases(?)
	* Source/NSTabViewItem.m: spits out correct values for string
	length, though more work is needed. No drawing, no events yet.

	NSPopUpButton now has basic functionality, ie. it works.

1999-06-19  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Images/common_Nibble.tiff: made inner gray area transparent.
	* Source/NSTabView.m: new file. implemented, save for drawing and
	event.
	* Source/NSTabViewItem.m: new file. implemented, save for drawing
	and event.

	TabView should be fun to get drawing. :-) I'm going to follow
Alfredo's lead by using a few drawn lines instead of bezier curves to draw
the tabs for now (since xgps doesn't do bezier).

1999-06-18  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Images/common_Nibble.tiff: new image for NSPopUpButton.
	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: more changes. still using a subclass of
	NSMenuMatrix but had to hack new methods in to make selected_item 
	working in the Matrix.
	- drawRect: draws the correct item.
	- synchronizeTitleAndSelectedItem: now informs our
	NSPopUpButtonMatrix which one of its cells is "selected", i.e. on top.
	* Source/NSPopUpButtonCell.m: added new file. empty class, used in
	the backend currently.

1999-06-17  Michael Hanni  <mhanni@sprintmail.com>

	* Source/NSPopUpButton.m: half way implemented. Most still in
	backend, but that will change soon. PopUp and PullDown work,
	however the entire event mechanism needs to be implemented.
	* Tools/Functions.m: added definitions for new NSDraw* functions
	used in NSPopUp.

	Benhur reported oddity in cell drawing code - cells were drawing their
	backgrounds in the method to draw the frame.  Fixed this by moving
	background drawing code to the drawInterior methods - also removed
	a lot of redundant code to workaround bugs in clipping that are now
	fixed.
	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m: update drawing code.
	* Source/NSButtonCell.m: ditto.
	* Source/NSCell.m: ditto.

Tue Feb 23 19:30:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Practically every file - I went through all the classes that conform
	to the NSCoding protocol and checked and tidied their initWithCoder
	and encodeWithCoder methods.  In some cases they simply needed the
	method prototypes fixing, but in most the initWithCoder method
	needed modifying to retain decoded ivar objects correctly!
	No guarantees that coding/decoding is correct now - but it's
	certainly a lot better.

Tue Feb 23 15:18:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	Various files - fixed all the copyWithZone: methods where objects are
	both copied AND retained.

1999-02-22  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

Thu Feb 18 13:12:00 1999  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSView.h: Listed all private methods allong with
	a warning that they shouldn't be overridden.  Removed a couple of
	unused ivars.  Added two new ivars - a cache for the visible rectangle
	and a flag to say whether it (and when we add it, a matrix to map
	to and from window coordinates) is currently valid.
	Added ([-_invalidateCoordinates]) method declaration.
	* Source/NSView.m: Much tidying up. Added ([-__invalidateCoordinates]).
	Modified ([-visibleRect]) to cache the visible rect and to clip the
	invalid rect.  Speeded up iterations over all subviews etc.

	* NSView.m display: fix for display bug in buttons example 
	* NSCell.m endEditing: fix for display bug in buttons example 
	* NSTextField.m textShouldEndEditing: The changes to these three classes
    fix a display bug visible in the buttons example when the top text field is 
    selected for editing and then asked to resign when the user clicks on say 
    the bottom text field.  This causes a rect encompassing both views to be 
    invalidated and displayed.  Beyond being inefficient this also causes a 
    display glitch given the current drawing methodology.

	even when a frame with fractional values was passed into the method).
	Yes, I know it's more lines of code - but it's better to have longer
	code that works correctly than shorter code that doesn't :-)
