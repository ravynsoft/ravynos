	* Headers/NSTableView.h
	* Source/NSTableView.m
	(-columnIndexesInRect:): Added new Mac OS 10.5 method.

2009-12-26 Riccardo Mottola <rmottola@users.sf.net>

	* Source/NSCell.m: Corrected c99-ism

2009-12-23  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSTextView.m (-dealloc, -breakUndoCoalescing,
	-shouldChangeTextInRange:replacementString:): Implement coalescing
	of undo actions for typing events.

	* Source/NSTextView.m (-selectedRange): Prevent crash when the
	receiver has no layout manager.

2009-12-23  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSTableView.m (-mouseDown:): A single click into a cell
	of an unselected row can now change the cell's state even when the
	table view allows dragging.

2009-12-22 17:31-EST Gregory John Casamento <greg.casamento@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSCell.m: Corrected documentation in GUI to reflect that
	this does nothing in the default implementation, according to spec.

2009-12-22  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSWindow.m (-validateUserInterfaceItem):
	* Source/NSWindow.m (-validateMenuItem): Generalize user interface
	validation for NSWindow.

	* Source/NSWindow.m (-undo:, -redo:): Use the first responder's
	undo manager if available. Avoids the need for overriding these
	methods in any responder class which supports undo/redo and is
	compatible with OS X.

2009-12-22  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSAlert.m (makeScrollViewWithRect):
	* Source/NSAlert.m (-sizePanelToFit): If the message text is too
	wide to fit into the panel wrap its text to the scroll view's
	width.

	* Source/NSAlert.m (-sizePanelToFit): Limit the width and height
	of an alert panel to 60% of the screen's width and height,
	respectively.

2009-12-21  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSScrollView.m (-isOpaque): Fix bug where an NSScrollView
	incorrectly claimed to be opaque while its clip view is not.

	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m (-setCanChooseDirectories): Reset the
	current selection of an open panel when directory selection is
	disabled. This prevents bogus directories being returned from the
	next modal session of the panel.

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m (-resetDefaults): Also reset the
	allowsOtherFileTypes attribute to its default when a fresh save
	panel is requested.

2009-12-21 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/GSIconManager.h,
	* Source/GSIconManager.m: New files. Allows to get icon placement
	from separate process.
	* Source/GNUmakefile: Add new file.
	* Source/NSWindow.m,
	* Source/NSApplication.m: Move icon handling into new file.
	Patch by German Arias <german@xelalug.org>.

2009-12-20 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSColorWell.m: Draw a black-and-white pattern behind
	transparent color swatches.

2009-12-20 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSColor.m: -[GSRGBColor isEqual:] was ignoring the alpha
	channel when testing equality.

2209-12-20 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSColorWell.m
	* Source/GSThemeDrawing.m
	* Source/NSColorPanel.m
	* Headers/AppKit/NSColorWell.h:
	Finish NSColorWell interaction tweaks:
	- activation of the now happens on mouseUp, not mouseDown
	- non-bordered NSColorWells can't be activated by clicking
	- non-bordered NSColorWells start a drag operation upon mouseDown
	- disabled NSColorWells don't accept colours being dropped on them
	- dropping a colour on the well inside the NSColorPanel now
	  also updates the active NSColorWell
	Also moved the static variable for keeping track of where the mouseDown
	occurred to an instance variable.

2009-12-21 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSTableColumn.m (-initWithCoder:, -encodeWithCoder:): Add
	the keyed encoding/decoding code for Quentin's extensions.

2009-12-20 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSSliderCell.m: Some more changes to NSSliderCell to get
	BezierPathLab working, and a test suite in
	tests/testsuite/gui/NSSliderCell. Set the doubleValue to 0 in -init,
	unarchive the @"NSValue" key and set the floatValue to it when
	unarchiving, adjust setObjectValue: so that when minValue > maxValue,
	the slider cell takes its value to be minValue.
	Also override setContinuous: and isContinuous to use
	NSLeftMouseDraggedMask rather than NSPeriodicMask, which makes
	the continuous setting of sliders in Nibs work properly in GNUstep.

2009-11-24 David Chisnall <theraven@gna.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: Replaced two superfluous NSInvocation
	construction occurrences with direct calls to the IMP in question.

2009-12-19 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSBezierPath.m: Change default flatness to 0.6 matching OS X

2009-12-19 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSCell.m (-setStringValue:): Remove optimisation for
	simple string case. Now -setObjectValue: is called in most cases.
	* Source/NSButtonCell.m (-attributedTitle, -setAttributedTitle:,
	-title, -setTitle:): Replace calls to super implementation with a
	simple local implementation.
	* Source/NSSliderCell.m: Remove most of the value setter methods,
	as they just duplicated super class behaviour.
	Move the setContinues: call into the init method.

2009-12-19 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSTextTable.h,
	* Source/NSTextTable.m,
	* Source/NSTextBlock.m,
	* Source/NSTextTableBlock.m: First attempt at implementing these classes.
	Code mostly by Nikolaus Schaller <hns@computer.org>.

2009-12-11 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSSliderCell.m:
	Rework the handling of maxValue and minValue. The cell's value is now
	clamped to the permisible range when it is set, rather than in
	floatValue, matching OS X behaviour. setMinValue: and setMaxValue:
	also clamp the current value.
	Also make NSSliderCell continuous by default when unarchived (matches
	OS X).

2009-12-17 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSTableView.m (-setDropRow:dropOperation:, -draggingUpdated):
	Corrected to support a drop on root with -1 as the drop row as explained
	in Cocoa documentation.

2009-12-17  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/GSThemeDrawing.m (-drawProgressIndicator:withBounds:...):
	Prevent division by zero exception if no images are available for
	a spinning or indeterminate progress indicator.

	* Source/NSProgressIndicator.m (-setIndeterminate): Ensure that a
	running animation is stopped when an indeterminate indicator is
	changed into a determinate one.

2009-12-17  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSComboBoxCell.m (-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:): Fix
	bug where the field editor of an edited combo box cell overlaps
	the cell's ellipsis button.

	* Source/NSComboBoxCell.m (-endEditing): Make sure the pop up
	window is closed when editing ends.

	* Source/NSComboBoxCell.m (-validateSelection): Remove obsolete
	workaround code.

2009-12-17  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSCell.m (-wraps, -setWraps:, -setLineBreakMode:,
	-initWithCoder:): Phase out the wraps cell attribute since it is
	implied by the lineBreakMode attribute. Note that with this change
	cells now wrap by default, as has always been the case on OS X.

	* Source/NSBrowserCell.m (-initTextCell:, -initImageCell:):
	* Source/NSTableColumn.m (-initWithIdentifier): Set default line
	break mode to NSLineBreakByTruncatingTail as on OS X.

	* Source/NSCell.m (-setUpFieldEditorAttributes:): Set the typing
	attributes of the field editor so that it uses the same paragraph
	style and in particular the same line break mode as the edited
	cell. This fixes an inconsistency where wrapped text would be
	displayed in a single line during editing.

2009-12-17  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSCell.m (-_setupTextWithFrame:inView:editor:delegate:range):
	* Source/NSCell.m (-endEditing:):
	Properly set up the field editor and its text container to handle
	cells whose text is wrapped, cells which truncate their text, and
	cells with scrollable contents, respectively, and prepare the
	field editor and its enclosing clip view to be resizable. Use a
	clip view only when necessary.
	* Source/NSCell.m (-_drawEditorWithFrame:inView:): Auxiliary
	method to update the frame of a cell's editor when the cell has
	been resized or moved.
	* Source/NSCell.m (-_setInEditing:): Helper method that allows
	control views to flag their edited cell.

	* Source/NSCell.m (-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView):
	* Source/NSTextFieldCell.m (-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView): Do not
	draw the interior of an edited cell.

	* Source/NSTableView.m (-moveColumn:toColumn:): Update the column
	index of the edited cell if necessary.

	* Source/NSControl.m (-drawRect:):
	* Source/NSTableView.m (-drawRow:clipRect:):
	* Source/NSOutlineView.m (-drawRow:clipRect): Remove obsolete
	workarounds to prevent an edited cell from being drawn twice.

	The preceding changes also should fix #22678.

2009-12-16  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSTextFieldCell.m (-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:):
	Override method and use drawInRect: to draw the string of the
	text field so that long text can be wrapped.

2009-12-16  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m (-_selectTextInColumn:, _selectCellName:,
	-controlTextDidChange:): Do a better job on validating the OK
	button. This makes it possible again to use the open panel for
	choosing directories. Also replaces the previous fix for bug
	#25471, which did not really work.

	* Source/NSBrowser.m (-doClick:): Fix NSBrowser so that branch
	cells are really deselected when multiple selection is enabled and
	allowsBranchSelection is set to NO. Also replace the workaround
	for bug #18881 by a better fix.

2009-12-15  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m (-ok:): Avoid the bogus warning that was
	shown when the panel requires a file type extension and the user
	has entered a file name without an extension.

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m (-filename): Do not replace an existing
	file type extension if allowsOtherFileTypes is set.

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m (-runModalForDirectory:file,
	-runModalForDirectory:file:relativeToWindow:,
	-beginSheetForDirectory:file:modalForWindow:modalDelegate:...):
	Initially enable the panel's OK button if a file name is provided
	to the modal session.

2009-12-15 Riccardo Mottola <rmottola@users.sf.net>

	* Source/NSOutlineView.m: removed c99-isms

2009-12-11 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/GSThemeTools.m: Correct the destination rect coordinates in
	scaleFillRect:, and the image slicing in initWithNinePatchImage:

2009-12-12 Eric Wasylishen <ewasylishen@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSBitmapImageRep.m:
	* Source/GSThemeTools.m:
	Change the colorAtX:y: and related methods in NSBitmapImageRep
	to use flipped coordinates, matching OS X. colorAtX:0 y:0 now
	returns the top-left pixel instead of the bottom left.

2009-12-12 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSApplication (-setWindowsMenu:): Only add windows that
	are either visible or miniaturized.

2009-12-11 13:09-EST Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/GSNibLoader.m: Added logging to help debugging of issues
	with nib loading.
	* Source/NSTextContainer.m: -[NSTextContainer initWithCoder:]
	removed call to unarchive the textview to prevent a leak.  Also
	don't set the textview as the text container.   Currently we
	just get the contents of the text container and rebuild it
	in NSTextView.m.

2009-12-10 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSKeyValueBinding.h:
	* Source/externs.m:
	* Source/NSWindow.m (+initialize, -bind:toObject:withKeyPath:options:):
	Added NSWindow 'title' binding.

2009-12-08 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSTableColumn.m (-dealloc): Fixed missing release for
	_sortDescriptorPrototype ivar.

2009-12-08 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Headers/NSTableColumn.h:
	* Source/NSTableColumn.m:
	Added all new table column methods and constants up to Mac OS X 10.6.
	These new additions remain to be fully implemented and the archiving code
	to be updated.

2009-12-08 Hans Baier <hansfbaier@googlemail.com>

	* Source/NSColorWell.m (-mouseDragged:, -mouseDown:): Applied
	patch from Eric Wasylishen to activate it on click inside the
	colored rectangle (same behavior as in OS X)

2009-12-06 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSOutlineView.m (-draggingUpdated:):
	Fixed drop above as a child in the previous row (when this row is an
	empty parent).
	(-drawDropAboveIndicatorWithDropItem:atRow:childDropIndex:): Fixed the
	drop above indicator drawing when the level doesn't match the previous
	row. Done by including an extra row parameter which makes possible to
	remove the row computation code that appears to partially duplicate
	-parentRowForRow:atLevel:andReturnChildIndex:.

2009-12-05 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSTableView.m (-_startDragOperationWithEvent:): Modified to call
	-canDragRowsWithIndexes:atPoint: as expected.

2009-12-05 Quentin Mathe <quentin.mathe@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSOutlineView.m (-draggingUpdated): Further simplified.
	Wrote detailed code documentation since the overall behavior is pretty
	complex.
	Fixed to compute the vertical and horizontal positions correctly when
	the view is scrolled.
	Fixed out of bounds exception when the pointer moves into the empty
	area below the rows (was trying to auto-expand the root item).
	Implemented drop on root indicator in addition to drop on row and drop
	drop above (works the same as Mac OS X).
	(-isExpandable:): Modified to always return NO when the item is nil (as
	Mac OS X does).
	(-drawDropAboveIndicatorWithDropItem:childDropIndex:,
	-drawDropOnRootIndicator, -drawDropOnWithDropItem:,
	-parentRowForRow:atLevel:andReturnChildIndex:): New methods extracted
	from -draggingUpdated.

2009-11-30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSOutlineView.m: Improve DnD allowing drop on items as well
	as inside them. Attempt to mimix OSX behavior.  Simplify code.
	Use triangular images similar to OSX appearance.
	Doubtless needs more polishing.

2009-11-29  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSView.m (-dealloc): Fix bug where -dealloc could break
	the key view chain.

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m (-ok:): Present a warning when the user has
	entered a filename with a wrong extension.

2009-11-29 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	more intelligent about moving the 'quit' item and 'info' submenu.

2009-11-27 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSSplitView.m: Correct the storing of the splitter locations
	in the defaults system (the autosave mechanism) ... was using NSNumber
	keys which was causing this to fail.

2009-11-26 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTableView.m: ([-noteNumberOfRowsChanged]) fixed to redraw
	the rectangle in the superview if the receiver shrinks.

2009-11-25  Wolfgang Lux  <wolfgang.lux@gmail.com>

	* Source/NSCell.m (-_updateFieldEditor:): Don't write back
	unchanged strings to the field editor. Should prevent the editor's
	selection from changing when -validateEditing is called.

	* Source/NSCell.m (-setAttributedStringValue:): Consider the
	attributed string a valid object if the cell has no formatter.

	* Source/NSTextField.m (-textDidEndEditing:): Fix bug in
	textDidEndEditing:.
	Patch by Doug Simons <doug.simons@testplant.com>.

2009-11-20 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	Improve documentation of -activate and -deactivate

2009-11-16 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m:
	* Source/GSThemeDrawing.m:
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepGUI/GSTheme.h:
	Removed duplicate theming methods...
	The ([-arrowImageForMenuItemCell]) method seems to have duplicated the
	([-imageNamed:]) method (for the @"NSMenuItem" image) and the
	([-backgroundColorForMenuItemCell:state:]) method seemed to have
	duplicated the ([colorNamed:state:cache]) method.
	We must not introduce extra APIs for getting images and colors or
	things will get unmaintainable.

2009-11-16 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSSlider.m: Clean up.
	* Source/NSSliderCell.m: Remove isFlipped method, correct

2009-11-15 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSTextView.m (-validateUserIntefaceItem:): Remove the
	dummy implementation of this method as there is now a proper one
	in NSTextView_actions.m.

	Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab keyboard events.

	* Source/NSTextView_actions.m (-validateMenuItem:,
	-validateUserIntefaceItem:): Implement menu and user interface
	item validation for NSTextView. The list of validated actions is
	incomplete but at least includes all items from a standard Edit
	menu.

	* Source/NSScrollView.m: If the scrollview has scrollers,
	don't pay attention to the hidden flag in nib loading.
	* Source/NSTableView.m: if the table has a cornerview, don't
	pay attention to the hidden flag in nib loading.
	NOTE: In both instances it appears that Cocoa sets the hidden flag
	when autohide is set to true.   GNUstep handles this case differently,
	so it's okay to ignore this flag when the scroller is in an
	NSScrollView.

	* Source/NSDrawer.m: Correction for NSDrawer issues with draw
	temporarily showing up above the window and not syncing with
	window position.

2009-04-10 10:24-EDT Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSAlert.m: in the method _initWithoutGModel add a call
	to setLevel: to set the level to NSModalPanelWindowLevel.   This was

2009-04-10 01:32-EDT Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: In the method
	- (void) setWindowFrameForAttachingToRect:... changed how
	popup/pulldown buttons handle the preferred edge.
	Per Cocoa documentation, the selected cell should always show up
	over the button for popups.   For pull down menus, the preferred
	edge is relevant.   This is also apparent from testing under Cocoa.

2009-04-09 22:55-EDT Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSRulerMarker.m: Changes suggested by Doug Simons for

	position also check orientaion for _isVertical == NO situation.
	This fix avoids situation when split view is vertical, postion
	changed but method exists after next 'else if' check.

2009-03-26 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSView.m (-setNeedsDisplay:, -setNeedsDisplayInRect:):

	* Source/NSRulerMarker.m: Use the bounds of the containing view

	* Source/GSThemePrivate.h:
	* Source/GSTheme.m:
	* Source/NSImage.m:
	Move/rename new proxy code to GSTheme.m and declare it in
	GSThemePrivate.h so that all code in the GUI can use it
	(we will need to allow other resources to automatically update
	to the current theme, not just images).

2009-02-09 20:16-EST Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSToolbar.m: (-windowDidUpdate:): Automatically update
	the toolbar on every window update.  This makes sure that

	* Source/NSImage.m: WARNING ... this change may have unforseen
	consequences.  Named images are replaced by proxies to the images
	so that all image drawing the the gui updates instantly when the
	theme changes.  It's possible that sme code uses the image in an
	unexpected way that the proxy does not support ... plase look out
	for that and report any problems so I can fix them.

2009-02-08 01:17-EST Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

2009-02-04 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: Don't attempt to set app icon until

	Fix size checks when setting image to cope if window does not
 	exist (was previously the normal case) to avoid streams of X
	errors on most systems and segmentation fault on sparc.

2009-02-04 01:53-EST Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/GSNibLoader.m: Correct the message to indicate an issue
	loading a nib, not a gorm, file.

	loading a nib in the same way that we initialize when loading
	a gorm file.

2009-02-03 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSCell.m (-_sendActionFrom:): New helper method for
	action sending.

2009-02-03 Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	missing retain of the named image.

2009-02-03 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTextContainer.m: Add some frame size checks.
	* Source/NSScrollView.m: ditto

	where the control being drawn is actually smaller than the tiles used.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSScreen.h:
	* Source/NSScreen.m: Cache device description dictionary ... when
	debugging the problem with theme tools (which caused a loop to
	repeatedly composite the tile image instead of doing it once), I
	noticed that almost every time I stopped the app in gdb, it was in
	the process of creating a device description, strongly suggesting
	that this is actually quite a time consuming part of drawing
	images.

2009-01-30 Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: Try to get behavior to match MacOS-X
	by moving call to -updateWindows to be done before getting the
	next event.  Updating is done only if it was flagged as needing
	to be done since the last update, but if we are in NSDefaultRunLoopMode
	or NSModalRunLoopMode we automatically set the flag before handling
	each event ... so unless the application explicitly turns it off,
	it's always done in these modes.
	Might fix #25384
	* Source/NSView.m: Invalidate tracking rects when they are removed
	from the view.
	Might fix #25385

	* Source/GSNibLoading.m: Temporarily comment out the release of
	connections until we find the cause of some current crashes.  This
	will be reverted ASAP.

	needs to be.

	* Source/NSMenuView.m: Refactor code which executes the action
	of a menu item at a given index into a separate method to make it
	easier to override this behavior when necessary.   Added method
	_executeItemAtIndex:removeSubmenu:.

	* TextConverters/RTF/RTFProducer.m (RTFDProducer -produceFileFrom:...):

	panel is now left with either NSOKButton or NSCancelButton
	(cf. the documentation of NSPrintPanel's -runModal: and
	-beginSheetWithPrintInfo:modalForWindow:delegate:didEndSelector:contextInfo:).
	* Source/NSPrintOperation.m: The callback passed to the print
	panel's beginSheet... method had a wrong signature (and also was
	misspelled). In addition, the code of the callback did retrieve
	its own callback from the print dictionary in a wrong way (was
	asking for a pointer to a selector while a selector was saved).
	* Source/NSDocument.m: The callback of
	-runModalPrintOperation:delegate:didRunSelector:contextInfo:
	method has a different signature than the one passed to the print
	operation's
	-runOperationModalForWindow:delegate:didRunSelector:contextInfo:
	method. This means NSDocument needs some adapter code and also has
	to save the delegate and selector passed to runModalPrintOperation...
	in some place.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSDocument.h: Since there can be at most one print dialog for a
	document, add two private instance variables to NSDocument for that purpose.

	* Source/NSWindow.m: Added exception called for in the
	documentation if NSWindow initWithCoder:/encodeWithCoder:
	is called with a keyed archiver.

2006-06-03  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSPrinter.m (-interpretQuotedValue:, -gethex:): Better

2006-06-01 00:13 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSDocumentFrameworkPrivate.h: Addition of new
	private methods to manage file types.
	* Headers/AppKit/NSDocument.h: New ivar _saveType.
	* Source/NSDocumentController.m: Implementation of new private
	methods.

	saveOperation: to use new methods to get the human readable
	filetypes to be listed in the dropdown in the savepanel and to
	properly retrieve the extension for the specified filetype
	and apply it to the backup filename and filename being saved.
	Also modified changeSaveType: to update the save panel's
	requiredFileType when the type is changed.

2006-05-21  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: Implement MacOS-X behavior (as determined
	by experimentation) of sending ([performKeyEquivalent:]) to main menu
	and to the key window.  This differs from the old behavior of sending
	to all windows and means that popup/pulldown menus on windows other
	than the key window now cannot be activated using key equivalents.

	* Source/NSDocument.m: Implemented accessory view logic when
	the document can save more than one filetype.

	key equivalents for off-screen windows.
	* Source/NSOpenPanel.m: Fix handling CR key equivalent (bug #16688)
	so that panel only takes action when it is active.
	* Source/NSSavePanel.m: ditto
	Fix done by disabling the ok button when the panel is not active,
	but what about if other panels have similar bugs ... shouldn't there
	be some automatic mechanism to stop buttons (but not menu items) from
	responding to key equivalents when a window is not the key window?
	* Source/NSButton.m: ([performKeyEquivalent:]) return NO if blocked
	by a modal window as per macos-x documentation.

2006-05-29 00:58 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: Correction for bug#16688.

2006-04-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: ([-sendEvent:]) try key equivalents for
	every key down, not just command modifiers ... consistent with
	MacOS-X and allows carriage return as a button/menu key.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: ([-performKeyEquivalent:]) only pass on to
	our views if this is the key window (NSMenu overrides this).

2006-04-27  Sergii Stoian <stoyan255@yahoo.com>

2006-02-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSMenu.m:
	* Source/NSApplication.m:
	* Source/NSMenuItemCell.m:
	* Headers/AppKit/NSMenuItemCell.h:
	Tidyups suggested by Fred. More ideas welcome.
	* Source/NSMenuView.m: When tracking mouse for horizontal MacOS-X
	style menu, ignore an immediate mouse up and continue tracking until
	something is clicked on.  This is the behavior of MacOS-X and windows.

2006-02-04  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

2006-02-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Source/NSToolbarItem.m (-[GSToolbarButtonCell setImagePosition:]):
    New method to override NSButtonCell behavior. It should be the last commit
    needed to correct bug #15112 (reported by Wolfgang Sourdeau). Precisely it
    eliminates the default title set with separator or space toolbar
    items and the image release with toolbar items which include one (both
    issues occurs when NSToolbarDisplayModeLabelnOnly is set).

2006-02-03  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Source/NSButtonCell.m (-setImagePosition:): Fixed the title lost (reset to
    the default one) which was wrongly occuring when the image position is
    switched to 'NSNoImage' (partial fix for bug #15112, based on an NSCell
    patch by Wolfgang Sourdeau).

2006-02-03  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSWorkspace.m: In GSLaunched() be more defensive and don't
	assume that the values which should be present in the notification
	userinfo dictionry really are there.
	* Source/NSApplication.m: Code more defensively setting up
	notification info.
	Honor the NSWindow -canHide method when hiding the application.
	* Source/GSServicesManager.m: Improve handling of incoming messages,
	prohibit remote processes from calling private methods.
	* Source/NSWindow.m:
	* Source/NSWindowController.m:
	* Source/NSDataLinkManager.m:
	* Source/NSTextView.m:
	* Source/NSDocumentController.m:
	* Source/NSDataLink.m:
	* Source/NSView.m:
	* Source/NSDocument.m:
	Revert harmless but stupid changes made last night when I was too
	tired.

2006-02-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSWorkspace.m: remove an app from list of launched apps if
	we can't contact it.
	* Source/NSApplication.m: ([hideOtherApplications:]) implemented.
	([unhideAllApplications:]) implemented.
	Send did hide and did unhide notifications to the workspace center
	so the workspace manager knows about them.
	Honor the NSWindow-canHide method when deactivating apps.
	* Source/NSWindow.m: Fix accessor methods which return a BOOL to
	do the right thing when they are accessing a bit in a bitfield.
	* Source/NSWindowController.m: ditto
	* Source/NSDataLinkManager.m: ditto
	* Source/NSTextView.m: ditto
	* Source/NSDocumentController.m: ditto
	* Source/NSDataLink.m: ditto
	* Source/NSView.m: ditto
	* Source/NSDocument.m: ditto
	Are these changes nneded?  The compiler seemed to be casting bitfield
	values to char as  things other than 1 or 0 ... but I was tired when
	looking at this and it seems unlikely.

2006-02-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: Send activation/deactivation notifications
	to workspace center too ... so workspace manager will know about it.
	* Source/NSWorkspace.m: Change internal method to launch applications
	so that it never asks the workspace manager to do it ... that should
	be handled by the public methods instead.  Simplify a little to take
	advantage of change to NSApplication.

2006-01-27  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: pass more informative user info in
	notifications.
	* Source/NSWorkspace.m: Implement filesystem based fallback mechanisms
	for tracking launched and active appplications when there is no
	workspace manager process to do it.
	Try to be consistent about asking workspace manager application to
	perform tasks for us if it exists.
	* Tools/gscloseall.m: Test tool to iterate through launched apps and
	terminate them all.
	* Tools/GNUmakefile:
	* Tools/GNUmakefile.preamble:
	Build new utility.

	function from Cocoa. NSFrameRectWithWidth() different
	implementation, no longer using stroke.

2006-01-20  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSSliderCell.m (-knobRectFlipped,-knobThickness
	-drawInteriorWithFrame:inView:, -setKnobThickness:): Protect against knob

2005-12-15  Quentin Mathe <qmathe@club-internet.fr>

    * Source/NSToolbarItem.m:
    (-[GSToolbarButton layout]): Don't set button based items width to their
    label width when NSToolbarDisplayModeIconOnly is active (based on patch
    by Wolfgang Sourdeau, partial fix for bug #15112). Removed superfuous code
    which substracted label height to button width in
    NSToolbarDisplayModeIconOnly case.
    (-initWithItemIdentifier:): Removed logical operator 'not' wrongly used
    with GSToolbarSeparatorItemIdentifier class identity test, it
    prevented any separator items to be inited therefore used (patch by
    Wolfgang Sourdeau, partial fix for bug #15112).

	notification object.  Fix handling of incoming notifications so that
	they use the new method and are therefore posted locally with the
	correct notification object.
	* Source/GSServicesManager.m: Make applications respond to the
	terminate: method sent from another app, but send a power off
	notification first, on the assumption that a terminate sent by
	a remote process is a power off or session manager shutdown or
	some similar event indicating that the process is likely to be
	forcably killed if it doesn't close down gracefully.

2005-10-05  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSCell.m (-setObjectValue:, -setStringValue:): When no

2005-08-22 14:36 Gregory John Casamento <greg_casamento@yahoo.com>

	* Source/NSInterfaceStyle.m: -[GSInterfaceStyle
	defaultsDidChange:] correction for val variable.  Previously

	Fix some documentation errors.

2005-07-12  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSApplication.m: (_NSAppKitUncaughtExceptionHandler)
	As there was no other feedback to the recent email thread on this,
	I've removed the option to try to 'ignore' the exception ... since
	it would most likely result in a random crash (possibly with loss
	of data etc) at a later point.

2005-07-09 Adrian Robert <arobert@cogsci.ucsd.edu>

	* Source/NSSavePanel.m (-ok:): Set _fullFileName before invoking

	containing the popup button was closed.

2005-05-30  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	happen when the cell gets deallocated without closing the popup.

2005-05-26  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSTableView.m (-mouseDown): Replaced use of
	_sendsActionOn: with a check if the value did change
	after the cell did track the mouse. Also use a copy of the cell,
	that way other cells are not affected by changes in the tracked
	cell. Patch based on code by Matt Rice <ratmice@yahoo.com>.

2005-05-22  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSComboBox.m (-cellSize) Added simple implementation of
	this method to get sizeToFit working.

	of the scroller from the popup item size, increase the popup width instead.

2005-05-20  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSCustomImageRep.m: Allow drawing if the delegate is
	set since the size may not have been set as of yet.  This behavior
	is consistent with that observed on OPENSTEP4.2/Mach.  This fix
	corrects bug #12412.

2005-04-03  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSTextView.h: Keep track of whether we are acting
	as a target for a DnD operation, and what the selected range was
	before the operation began.
	* Source/NSTextView.m: Display insertion point during DnD operation
	Fixes bug #9788

2005-04-02  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSTableView.m: ([-mouseDown:]) tweak vertical image
	offset because view is flipped.  Still not sure this code is
	correct  ... which coordinate system is the image offset supplied
	by ([-dragImageForRows:event:dragImageOffset:]) supposed to be in?

2005-04-01  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Headers/AppKit/NSDataLinkManager.h, Source/NSDataLinkManager.m:
	Re-add the changes from 2005-03-05.

2005-04-01  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSDragView.m: when dragging, use the mouse offset to adjust
	the initial position of the dragged image.
	Modified internally to pass the original position of the image so
	that slideback can slide to that position rather than the position
	the mouse started from.  This makes no difference if the initial
	mouse offset was zero, but does have an effect if the drag was
	initiated by a mouse move at a location offset from the original
	mouse down.
	Exposed a couple of methods for subclasses.
	* Source/NSColorPanel.m: Set image position for DnD so that color
	swatch is centered on the mouse position.
	* Source/NSImageView.m: ditto
	* Source/NSTableView.m: ([-mouseDown:]) after calling the
	([-dragImageForRows:event:dragImageOffset:]) method, use the
	returned offset to position the center of the image relative
	to the mouse pointer .. I *think* that's what the apple documentation
	of the method means.

2005-03-30  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	* Version 0.9.5

	* Headers/AppKit/NSDataLinkManager.h, Source/NSDataLinkManager.m:
	Partially revert 2005-03-05 patch for this release.

	subclassing.

2005-03-28  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/GSDragView.m: Fix a few bugs exposed by windows port and
	tidy/add comments to clarify operation.  When initiating DnD session,
	take offset argument into account rather than ignoring it.
	* Headers/Additions/GNUstepGUI/GSDragView.h: Improve comments and
	change offset to be NSSize rather thgan NSPoint.

2005-03-21  Adam Fedor  <fedor@gnu.org>

	Headers/AppKit/NSPageLayout.h: Modify arg name for same purpose.
	* Source/NSAffineTransform.m, Source/NSFontManager.m,
	Source/NSPageLayout.m: Modify to match header. (Patch from
	Francis Franklin, with some modifications).

2005-03-14  Fred Kiefer <FredKiefer@gmx.de>

	* Source/NSMatrix.m:
	([_renewRows:columns:rowSpace:colSpace:]) Corrected last patch so
	that the open panel works again. Initialize all new cells, not
	just the requested ones.

2005-03-14  Richard Frith-Macdonald <rfm@gnu.org>

	* Source/NSMatrix.m:
	([removeRow:]) set column counts to zero if all rows are removed
	([removeColumn:]) set row counts to zero if all columns are removed
	([_renewRows:columns:rowSpace:colSpace:]) initialise all columns of
	any newly created rows (up to _maxCols) rather than just the number
	specified by the method argument.  Otherwise we get uninitialised
