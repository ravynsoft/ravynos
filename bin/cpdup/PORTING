				PORTING CPDUP

    The manual page for cpdup is "cpdup.1".  This file describes how to
    to port the program to other OS's.

				PORTING TO BSD

    cpdup was developed on BSD.  Most BSDs should just be able to compile
    cpdup using the Makefile.

				PORTING TO LINUX

    This script should suffice when compiling under linux.  For some reason
    that I cannot fathom, linux defaults to using a 32 bit off_t.  It makes
    no sense at all to me why they would want to do this, BSDs went to
    a 64 bit default off_t over 15 years ago.  In anycase, fixing it
    requires a few -D options.

    #!/bin/csh
    #
    cd cpdup
    rm -f md5.c
    rm -f *.o
    cc -D__unused= -D_GNU_SOURCE -D__USE_FILE_OFFSET64 -DNOMD5 *.c -c
    cc -D__unused= -D_GNU_SOURCE -D__USE_FILE_OFFSET64 -DNOMD5 *.o -o ~/bin/cpdup

    BACKUP SCRIPT MODIFICATIONS - you will almost certainly have to adjust
    the do_cleanup script to extract the proper field(s) from the df output.
    You will probably have to use 'df' instead of 'df -i', and you may have
    to adjust the script to not check the inode fields.
