.TH GPBS 1 "September 2006" GNUstep "GNUstep System Manual"
.SH NAME
gpbs \- GNUstep PasteBoard Server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpbs
.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B gpbs
daemon serves as a clipboard/pasteboard for GNUstep programs,
handling the copying, cutting and pasting of objects as well as
drag and drop operations between applications.
.P
Every user needs to have his own instance of
.B gpbs
  running. While
.B gpbs
will be started automatically as soon as it is needed,
it is recommend to start
.B gpbs
in a personal login script like ~/.bashrc or ~/.cshrc.
Alternatively you can launch gpbs when your windowing system or the
window manager is started. For example, on systems with X11 you can 
launch
.B gpbs
from your .xinitrc script or alternatively
- if you are running Window Maker - put it in Window Maker's autostart 
script.
See the
.I GNUstep Build Guide
for a sample startup script.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-NSHost\fR \fB<hostname>\fR
attaches \fBgpbs\fR to a remote session.

.TP
\fB\--GSStartupNotification\fR
sends a notification through the NSDistributedNotificationCenter (i.e. 
gdnc) so that apps know that it has started up. This is only relevant 
if the application itself tries to startup \fBgpbs\fR (which means 
\fBgpbs\fR was not started at session login).
.TP
\fB\--daemon\fR
starts \fBgpbs\fR as a daemon - mostly this means that all output gets 
sent to syslog rather than the terminal.
.TP
\fB\--no-fork\fR
does not fork a separate process
.TP
\fB\--verbose\fR
makes \fB\gpbs\fR his logging more verbose

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B gdomap -L GNUstepGSPasteboardServer
will lookup instances of
.B gpbs.
.P
Alternatively,
.B gdomap -N
will list all registered names on the local host.
.P
.SH BUGS
Versions of
.B gpbs
up to (including) 1.7.2 have problems with copy and paste of
mulit-lingual text, as it used the atom XA_STRING alone to
exchange string data between X clients (and thus GNUstep clients).
This means
.B  gpbs
is inherently unable to do cut-and-paste with characters
other than ISO Latin1 ones, TAB, and NEWLINE.
