1.26 Noteworthy changes in version '0.10.1'

The art graphics module is the default now.  As was previously the case,
if the proper libraries are not found, the configuration will
automatically switch to xlib on winlib (whichever is appropriate).

   There was a great deal of work by Tom MacSween on the windows module
to get windows and taskbars working together, closing, opening, hiding,
and just general good window management.

   The Cairo module has been significantly updated and now works with
Cariro version 1.0, although you need to make some minor changes to the
Cairo library before it will work with GNUstep.  Due to this, this
module is still considered beta.  Ask on the mailing lists for help with
this.

1.27 Noteworthy changes in version '0.10.0'
===========================================

The installed name of the backend now includes an interface version
number.  This avoids the potential version mismatch between the frontend

     speed things up on old X11 servers and/or remote servers).
   * GNUstep modifier keys are mapped to KeySyms instead of KeyCodes
   * Added a Cairo backend, although it is probably non-functional.
     Anyone is invited to contribute to making it work.

1.45 Noteworthy changes in version '0.7.7'
==========================================

First release.  Most components extracted from xgps.  The old backends,
xgps and xdps were depreciated in favor of this new backend, simply
named back, which can be configured for a variety of window server and
graphics implementations, and also allow for improved code sharing.

   In addition there is now a window server backend for Windows
computers, although it is in a very alpha state.
