  character.  This allows register names to be distinguished from label names.

* Macros with a variable number of arguments are now supported. See the
  documentation for how this works.

* Added --reduce-memory-overheads switch to reduce the size of the hash
  tables used, at the expense of longer assembly times, and
  --hash-size=<NUMBER> to set the size of the hash tables used by gas.

* Macro names and macro parameter names can now be any identifier that would
  also be legal as a symbol elsewhere. For macro parameter names, this is
  known to cause problems in certain sources when the respective target uses
  characters inconsistently, and thus macro parameter references may no longer

  maximum number of bytes to skip.  If doing the alignment would require
  skipping more than the given number of bytes, the alignment is not done at
  all.

* The ELF assembler has a new pseudo-op, .symver, used for symbol versioning.

* The -a option takes a new suboption, c (e.g., -alc), to skip false
  conditionals in listings.

* Added new pseudo-op, .equiv; it's like .equ, except that it is an error if
  the symbol is already defined.

Changes in 2.7:

* The PowerPC assembler now allows the use of symbolic register names (r0,
  etc.) if -mregnames is used.  Symbolic names preceded by a '%' (%r0, etc.)
  can be used any time.  PowerPC 860 move to/from SPR instructions have been
  added.

* Alpha Linux (ELF) support added.

* PowerPC ELF support added.

* m68k Linux (ELF) support added.

* i960 Hx/Jx support added.

* i386/PowerPC gnu-win32 support added.

* SCO ELF support added.  For OpenServer 5 targets (i386-unknown-sco3.2v5) the
  default is to build COFF-only support.  To get a set of tools that generate
  ELF (they'll understand both COFF and ELF), you must configure with
  target=i386-unknown-sco3.2v5elf.

* m88k-motorola-sysv3* support added.

Changes in 2.6:

* Gas now directly supports macros, without requiring GASP.

* Gas now has an MRI assembler compatibility mode.  Use -M or --mri to select
  MRI mode.  The pseudo-op ``.mri 1'' will switch into the MRI mode until the
  ``.mri 0'' is seen; this can be convenient for inline assembler code.

* Added --defsym SYM=VALUE option.

* Added -mips4 support to MIPS assembler.

* Added PIC support to Solaris and SPARC SunOS 4 assembler.

Changes in 2.4:

* Converted this directory to use an autoconf-generated configure script.

* ARM support, from Richard Earnshaw.

* Updated VMS support, from Pat Rankin, including considerably improved
  debugging support.

* Support for the control registers in the 68060.

* Handles (ignores) a new directive ".this_GCC_requires_the_GNU_assembler", to
  provide for possible future gcc changes, for targets where gas provides some
  features not available in the native assembler.  If the native assembler is
  used, it should become obvious pretty quickly what the problem is.

* Usage message is available with "--help".

* The GNU Assembler Preprocessor (gasp) is included.  (Actually, it was in 2.3
  also, but didn't get into the NEWS file.)

* Weak symbol support for a.out.

* A bug in the listing code which could cause an infinite loop has been fixed.
  Bugs in listings when generating a COFF object file have also been fixed.

* Initial i386-svr4 PIC implementation from Eric Youngdale, based on code by
  Paul Kranenburg.

* Improved Alpha support.  Immediate constants can have a much larger range
  now. Support for the 21164 has been contributed by Digital.

* Updated ns32k (pc532-mach, netbsd532) support from Ian Dall.

Changes in 2.3:

* Mach i386 support, by David Mackenzie and Ken Raeburn.

* RS/6000 and PowerPC support by Ian Taylor.

* VMS command scripts (make-gas.com, config-gas.com) have been worked on a bit,
  based on mail received from various people.  The `-h#' option should work
  again too.

* HP-PA work, by Jeff Law.  Note, for the PA, gas-2.3 has been designed to work
  with gdb-4.12 and gcc-2.6.  As gcc-2.6 has not been released yet, a special
  version of gcc-2.5.8 has been patched to work with gas-2.3.  You can retrieve
  this special version of gcc-2.5.8 via anonymous ftp from jaguar.cs.utah.edu
  in the "dist" directory.

* Vax support in gas fixed for BSD, so it builds and seems to run a couple
  simple tests okay.  I haven't put it through extensive testing.  (GNU make is
  currently required for BSD 4.3 builds.)

* Support for the DEC Alpha, running OSF/1 (ECOFF format).  The gas support is
  based on code donated by CMU, which used an a.out-based format.  I'm afraid
  the alpha-a.out support is pretty badly mangled, and much of it removed;
  making it work will require rewriting it as BFD support for the format anyways.

* Irix 5 support.

* The test suites have been fixed up a bit, so that they should work with a
  couple different versions of expect and dejagnu.

* Symbols' values are now handled internally as expressions, permitting more
  flexibility in evaluating them in some cases.  Some details of relocation
  handling have also changed, and simple constant pool management has been
  added, to make the Alpha port easier.

* New option "--statistics" for printing out program run times.  This is
  intended to be used with the gcc "-Q" option, which prints out times spent in
  various phases of compilation.  (You should be able to get all of them
  printed out with "gcc -Q -Wa,--statistics", I think.)

Changes in 2.2:

* RS/6000 AIX and MIPS SGI Irix 5 support has been added.

* Configurations that are still in development (and therefore are convenient to
  have listed in configure.in) still get rejected without a minor change to
  gas/Makefile.in, so people not doing development work shouldn't get the
  impression that support for such configurations is actually believed to be
  reliable.

* The program name (usually "as") is printed when a fatal error message is
  displayed.  This should prevent some confusion about the source of occasional
  messages about "internal errors".

* ELF support is falling into place.  Support for the 386 should be working.
  Support for SPARC Solaris is in.  HPPA support from Utah is being integrated.

* Symbol values are maintained as expressions instead of being immediately
  boiled down to add-symbol, sub-symbol, and constant.  This permits slightly
  more complex calculations involving symbols whose values are not alreadey
  known.

* DBX-style debugging info ("stabs") is now supported for COFF formats.
  If any stabs directives are seen in the source, GAS will create two new
  sections: a ".stab" and a ".stabstr" section.  The format of the .stab
  section is nearly identical to the a.out symbol format, and .stabstr is
  its string table.  For this to be useful, you must have configured GCC
  to generate stabs (by defining DBX_DEBUGGING_INFO), and must have a GDB
  that can use the stab sections (4.11 or later).

* LynxOS, on i386 and m68k platforms, is now supported.  SPARC LynxOS
  support is in progress.

Changes in 2.1:

* Several small fixes for i386-aix (PS/2) support from Minh Tran-Le have been
  incorporated, but not well tested yet.

* Altered the opcode table split for m68k; it should require less VM to compile
  with gcc now.

* Some minor adjustments to add (Convergent Technologies') Miniframe support,
  suggested by Ronald Cole.

* HPPA support (running OSF only, not HPUX) has been contributed by Utah.  This
  includes improved ELF support, which I've started adapting for SPARC Solaris
  2.x.  Integration isn't completely, so it probably won't work.

* HP9000/300 support, donated by HP, has been merged in.

* Ian Taylor has finished the MIPS ECOFF (Ultrix, Irix) support.

* Better error messages for unsupported configurations (e.g., hppa-hpux).

* Test suite framework is starting to become reasonable.

Changes in 2.0:

* Mostly bug fixes.

* Some more merging of BFD and ELF code, but ELF still doesn't work.

Changes in 1.94:

* BFD merge is partly done.  Adventurous souls may try giving configure the
  "--with-bfd-assembler" option.  Currently, ELF format requires it, a.out
  format accepts it; SPARC CPU accepts it.  It's the default only for OS "elf"
  or "solaris".  (ELF isn't really supported yet.  It needs work.  I've got
  some code from Utah for HP-PA ELF, and from DG for m88k ELF, but they're not
  fully merged yet.)

* The 68K opcode table has been split in half.  It should now compile under gcc
  without consuming ridiculous amounts of memory.

* A couple data structures have been reduced in size.  This should result in
  saving a little bit of space at runtime.

* Support for MIPS, from OSF and Ralph Campbell, has been merged in.  The OSF
  code provided ROSE format support, which I haven't merged in yet.  (I can
  make it available, if anyone wants to try it out.)  Ralph's code, for BSD
  4.4, supports a.out format.  We don't have ECOFF support in just yet; it's
  coming.

* Support for the Hitachi H8/500 has been added.

* VMS host and target support should be working now, thanks chiefly to Eric
  Youngdale.

Changes in 1.93.01:

* For m68k, support for more processors has been added: 68040, CPU32, 68851.

* For i386, .align is now power-of-two; was number-of-bytes.

* For m68k, "%" is now accepted before register names.  For COFF format, which
  doesn't use underscore prefixes for C labels, it is required, so variable "a0"
  can be distinguished from the register.

* Last public release was 1.38.  Lots of configuration changes since then, lots
  of new CPUs and formats, lots of bugs fixed.
