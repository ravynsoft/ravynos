@cindex line comment character, PJ
@cindex PJ line comment character
The presence of a @samp{!} or @samp{/} on a line indicates the start
of a comment that extends to the end of the current line.

If a @samp{#} appears as the first character of a line then the whole
line is treated as a comment, but in this case the line could also be
a logical line number directive (@pxref{Comments}) or a preprocessor
control command (@pxref{Preprocessing}).

@cindex line separator, PJ
@cindex statement separator, PJ
@cindex PJ line separator
The @samp{;} character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.
