elfcpp is a C++ library for reading and writing ELF information.  This
was written to support gold, the ELF linker, and may not be generally
useful.

elfcpp does not do file I/O.  It deals only with offsets and memory
data.

For efficiency, most accessors are templates with two arguments: the
ELF file class (32 or 64 bits) and the endianness.
