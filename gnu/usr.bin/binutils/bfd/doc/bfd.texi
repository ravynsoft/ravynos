@chapter Introduction
@cindex BFD
@cindex what is it?
BFD is a package which allows applications to use the
same routines to operate on object files whatever the object file
format.  A new object file format can be supported simply by
creating a new BFD back end and adding it to the library.

BFD is split into two parts: the front end, and the back ends (one for
each object file format).
@itemize @bullet
@item The front end of BFD provides the interface to the user. It manages
memory and various canonical data structures. The front end also
decides which back end to use and when to call back end routines.
@item The back ends provide BFD its view of the real world. Each back
end provides a set of calls which the BFD front end can use to maintain
its canonical form. The back ends also may keep around information for
their own use, for greater efficiency.

@node History
@section History

One spur behind BFD was the desire, on the part of the GNU 960 team at
Intel Oregon, for interoperability of applications on their COFF and
b.out file formats.  Cygnus was providing GNU support for the team, and
was contracted to provide the required functionality.

The name came from a conversation David Wallace was having with Richard
Stallman about the library: RMS said that it would be quite hard---David
said ``BFD''.  Stallman was right, but the name stuck.

At the same time, Ready Systems wanted much the same thing, but for
different object file formats: IEEE-695, Oasys, Srecords, a.out and 68k
coff.

BFD was first implemented by members of Cygnus Support; Steve
Chamberlain (@code{sac@@cygnus.com}), John Gilmore
(@code{gnu@@cygnus.com}), K.  Richard Pixley (@code{rich@@cygnus.com})
and David Henkel-Wallace (@code{gumby@@cygnus.com}).



@node How It Works
@section How To Use BFD

To use the library, include @file{bfd.h} and link with @file{libbfd.a}.	

BFD provides a common interface to the parts of an object file
for a calling application. 

When an application successfully opens a target file (object, archive, or
whatever), a pointer to an internal structure is returned. This pointer
points to a structure called @code{bfd}, described in
@file{bfd.h}.  Our convention is to call this pointer a BFD, and
instances of it within code @code{abfd}.  All operations on
the target object file are applied as methods to the BFD.  The mapping is
defined within @code{bfd.h} in a set of macros, all beginning
with @samp{bfd_} to reduce namespace pollution.

For example, this sequence does what you would probably expect:
return the number of sections in an object file attached to a BFD
@code{abfd}. 

@example
@c @cartouche
#include "bfd.h"

unsigned int number_of_sections (abfd)
bfd *abfd;
@{
  return bfd_count_sections (abfd);
@}
@c @end cartouche
@end example

The abstraction used within BFD is that an object file has:

@itemize @bullet
@item
a header,
@item
a number of sections containing raw data (@pxref{Sections}),
@item
a set of relocations (@pxref{Relocations}), and
@item
some symbol information (@pxref{Symbols}).
@end itemize
@noindent
Also, BFDs opened for archives have the additional attribute of an index
and contain subordinate BFDs. This approach is fine for a.out and coff,
but loses efficiency when applied to formats such as S-records and
IEEE-695.

@node Memory Usage
@section Memory Usage
BFD keeps all of its internal structures in obstacks. There is one obstack
per open BFD file, into which the current state is stored. When a BFD is
closed, the obstack is deleted, and so everything which has been
allocated by BFD for the closing file is thrown away.

BFD does not free anything created by an application, but pointers into
@code{bfd} structures become invalid on a @code{bfd_close}; for example,
after a @code{bfd_close} the vector passed to
@code{bfd_canonicalize_symtab} is still around, since it has been
allocated by the application, but the data that it pointed to are
lost.

The general rule is to not close a BFD until all operations dependent
upon data from the BFD have been completed, or all the data from within
the file has been copied. To help with the management of memory, there
is a function (@code{bfd_alloc_size}) which returns the number of bytes
in obstacks associated with the supplied BFD. This could be used to
select the greediest open BFD, close it to reclaim the memory, perform
some operation and reopen the BFD again, to get a fresh copy of the data
structures.
