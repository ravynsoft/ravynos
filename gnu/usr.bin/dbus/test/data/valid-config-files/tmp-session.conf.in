  EXTERNAL, which uses credential-passing over Unix sockets.

  This authentication mechanism is not available on Windows,
  is not suitable for use with the tcp: or nonce-tcp: transports,
  and will not work on obscure flavours of Unix that do not have
  a supported credentials-passing mechanism. On those platforms/transports,
  comment out the <auth> element to allow fallback to DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1. -->

  <!-- For the session bus, override the default relatively-low limits
       with essentially infinite limits, since the bus is just running
       as the user anyway, using up bus resources is not something we need
       to worry about. In some cases, we do set the limits lower than
       "all available memory" if exceeding the limit is almost certainly a bug,
       having the bus enforce a limit is nicer than a huge memory leak. But the
       intent is that these limits should never be hit. -->
