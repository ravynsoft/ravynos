Usage: run-test [OPTION...] CHECKER PROGRAM [ARGUMENT...]

Runs PROGRAM under the control of CHECKER.

CHECKER may be empty or a valgrind command with some options, such as
'valgrind --tool=memcheck --num-callers=20 --leak-check=yes --leak-resolution=high --show-reachable=yes'.

When CHECKER is not empty, it is recommended that the package has been
configured with
  --disable-shared     so that tests are real executables and not libtool
                       wrapper scripts, and
  CFLAGS=\"-g\"          so that valgrind shows line numbers.

Report bugs to Bruno Haible."
