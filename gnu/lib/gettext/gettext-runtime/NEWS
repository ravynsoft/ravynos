Version 0.22.3 - October 2023

* Portability:
  - The libintl library now works on macOS 14.  (Older versions of libintl
    crash on macOS 14, due to an incompatible change in macOS.)

Version 0.22.2 - September 2023

* Bug fix:
  - The libintl shared library now exports again some symbols that were
    accidentally missing.
    <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?64323>
    This bug was introduced in version 0.22.

Version 0.21.1 - October 2022

* On AIX, locale names with a script or with an uppercase language are now
  supported.
  For example, sr_Cyrl_RS.UTF-8 is treated like sr_RS.UTF-8@cyrillic, and
  EN_US.UTF-8 is treated like en_US.UTF-8.

Version 0.21 - July 2020

* On native Windows platforms, the directory that contains the message
  catalogs may now contain arbitrary Unicode characters. To make use of
  this feature, use the new function 'wbindtextdomain' instead of
  'bindtextdomain'. It allows to pass a directory name in wchar_t[] encoding.
  Note: 'wbindtextdomain' exists only on native Windows platforms.

Version 0.20.2 - April 2020

* The interpretation of the language preferences on macOS has been improved,
  especially in the case where a system locale does not exist for the
  combination of the selected primary language and the selected territory.

* Fixed a multithread-safety bug on Cygwin and native Windows.

Version 0.20 - April 2019

* The interpretation of the language preferences on macOS has been fixed.

* Per-thread locales are now also supported on Solaris 11.4.

* The replacements for the printf()/fprintf()/... functions that are
  provided through <libintl.h> on native Windows and NetBSD are now POSIX
  compliant.  There is no conflict any more between these replacements
  and other possible replacements provided by gnulib or mingw.

Version 0.18.3 - July 2013

* On Mac OS X systems, the setlocale() function now properly
  invalidates loaded message catalogs when a locale has been set.


Version 0.18 - May 2010

* On MacOS X and Windows systems, <libintl.h> now extends setlocale() and
  newlocale() so that their determination of the default locale considers
  the choice the user has made in the system control panels.

* On MacOS X systems, the gettext()/dgettext()/... functions now respect the
  locale of the current thread, if a thread-specific locale has been set.

Version 0.16.1 - November 2006

* Bug fix in the gettext.m4 autoconf macros.

Version 0.16 - October 2006

* Interoperability with automake-1.10.

* Autoconf macros:
  - The gettext autoconf macros now require autoconf 2.52 or newer.
  - A new autoconf macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT_INTL_SUBDIR is added. It allows to
    specify the presence of an intl/ subdirectory outside the AM_GNU_GETTEXT
    invocation.
  - A new autoconf macro AM_GNU_GETTEXT_NEED is added. It allows to specify
    the requirements relating to the GNU gettext implementation outside the
    AM_GNU_GETTEXT invocation.

Version 0.14.4 - April 2005

* The gettext autoconf macros will now work with the forthcoming g++ 4.0.
* Fix improved detection of the locale on MacOS X.

Version 0.14.2 - January 2005

* Improved detection of the locale on MacOS X.
* The gettext autoconf macros now require autoconf 2.50 or newer.

Version 0.14 - January 2004

* New library: GNU.Gettext.dll contains the runtime for using GNU gettext
  message catalogs in C#.

* Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
  bokmål changed from 'no' to 'nb' recently (in 2003). During the transition
  period, while some message catalogs for this language are installed under
  'nb' and some older ones under 'no', it's recommended for Norwegian users to
  set the LANGUAGE environment variable to 'nb:no' so that both newer and
  older translations are used.

Version 0.13 - November 2003

* On those few platforms (NetBSD and Woe32) for which the native
  printf()/fprintf()/... functions don't support POSIX/XSI format strings
  with positions, replacements are provided through <libintl.h>.

* New function library:
    gettext.sh - shell functions for internationalized shell scripts
* New program:
    envsubst - substitutes environment variables in shell format strings

Version 0.12 - May 2003

* A new C++ class, called gnu::autosprintf, makes it possible to use C format
  strings in C++. This is needed for proper internationalization of C++
  programs.
