GNUstep Objective-C Runtime 1.2
===============================

This is the 1.2 release of the GNUstep Objective-C runtime (a.k.a.
libobjc2).  This runtime was designed to support the features of Objective-C 2
for use with GNUstep and other Objective-C programs.  This release contains
several bug fixes, and is tested with the current GNUstep trunk, so will be
compatible with the upcoming GNUstep release.

You may obtain the code for this release from subversion at the following
subversion branch:

svn://svn.gna.org/svn/gnustep/libs/libobjc2/1.2

Alternatively, a tarball is available from:

http://download.gna.org/gnustep/libobjc2-1.2.tar.bz2

The runtime library is responsible for implementing the core features of the
object model, as well as exposing introspection features to the user.  The
GNUstep runtime implements Apple's Objective-C Runtime APIs, and a small number
of GCC APIs for legacy compatibility.

This library is based on the Étoilé Objective-C Runtime, an earlier research
prototype, and includes support for non-fragile instance variables,
type-dependent dispatch, and object planes.  It is fully compatible with the
FSF's GCC Objective-C ABI and also implements a new ABI that is supported by
Clang and is required for some of the newer features.

Although the runtime has been tested by several people, and is being used
extensively by the Étoilé project, it is entirely new (MIT licensed) code and
may still contain bugs.  If you come across any problems, please report them to
the GNUstep Developer mailing list <gnustep-dev@gnu.org>.
