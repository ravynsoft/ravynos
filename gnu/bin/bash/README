Introduction
============

This is GNU Bash, version 5.2. Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne
Again SHell, a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec,
but also with interactive command line editing, job control on
architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history
substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. 
For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this
type of shell, see the file `doc/bashref.texi'.  There is also a
large Unix-style man page.  The man page is the definitive description
of the shell's features. 

See the file POSIX for a discussion of how the Bash defaults differ
from the POSIX spec and a description of the Bash `posix mode'.

There are some user-visible incompatibilities between this version
of Bash and previous widely-distributed versions, bash-4.4, bash-5.0,
and bash-5.1. For details, see the file COMPAT.  The NEWS file tersely
lists features that are new in this release. 

Bash is free software, distributed under the terms of the [GNU] General
Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation,
version 3 of the License (or any later version).  For more information,
see the file COPYING. 

A number of frequently-asked questions are answered in the file
`doc/FAQ'. (That file is no longer updated.)

To compile Bash, type `./configure', then `make'.  Bash auto-configures
the build process, so no further intervention should be necessary.  Bash
builds with `gcc' by default if it is available.  If you want to use `cc'
instead, type

	CC=cc ./configure

if you are using a Bourne-style shell.  If you are not, the following
may work:

	env CC=cc ./configure

Read the file INSTALL in this directory for more information about how
to customize and control the build process.  The file NOTES contains
platform-specific installation and configuration information.

If you are a csh user and wish to convert your csh aliases to Bash
aliases, you may wish to use the script `examples/misc/alias-conv.sh'
as a starting point.  The script `examples/misc/cshtobash' is a
more ambitious script that attempts to do a more complete job.

Reporting Bugs
==============

Bug reports for bash should be sent to:

	bug-bash@gnu.org

using the `bashbug' program that is built and installed at the same
time as bash.

The discussion list `bug-bash@gnu.org' often contains information
about new ports of Bash, or discussions of new features or behavior
changes that people would like.  This mailing list is also available
as a usenet newsgroup: gnu.bash.bug. 

When you send a bug report, please use the `bashbug' program that is
built at the same time as bash.  If bash fails to build, try building
bashbug directly with `make bashbug'.  If you cannot build `bashbug',
please send mail to bug-bash@gnu.org with the following information:

	* the version number and release status of Bash (e.g., 2.05a-release)
	* the machine and OS that it is running on (you may run
	  `bashversion -l' from the bash build directory for this information)
	* a list of the compilation flags or the contents of `config.h', if
	  appropriate
	* a description of the bug
	* a recipe for recreating the bug reliably
	* a fix for the bug if you have one!

The `bashbug' program includes much of this automatically.

Questions and requests for help with bash and bash programming may be
sent to the help-bash@gnu.org mailing list.

If you would like to contact the Bash maintainers directly, send mail
to bash-maintainers@gnu.org.

While the Bash maintainers do not promise to fix all bugs, we would
like this shell to be the best that we can make it.

Other Packages
==============

This distribution includes, in examples/bash-completion, a recent version
of the `bash-completion' package, which provides programmable completions
for a number of commands. It's available as a package in many distributions,
and that is the first place from which to obtain it.

The latest version of bash-completion is always available from
https://github.com/scop/bash-completion.

If it's not a package from your vendor, you may install the included version.

Enjoy!
