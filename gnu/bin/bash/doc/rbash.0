       rbash - restricted bash, see bbaasshh(1)

RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL
       If bbaasshh is started with the name rrbbaasshh, or the --rr option is supplied at
       invocation, the shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell  is  used
       to  set  up an environment more controlled than the standard shell.  It
       behaves identically to bbaasshh with the exception that the  following  are
       disallowed or not performed:

       +o      changing directories with ccdd

       +o      setting  or  unsetting the values of SSHHEELLLL, PPAATTHH, HHIISSTTFFIILLEE, EENNVV,
              or BBAASSHH__EENNVV

       +o      specifying command names containing //

       +o      specifying a filename containing a // as an  argument  to  the  ..
              builtin command

       +o      specifying  a  filename containing a slash as an argument to the
              hhiissttoorryy builtin command

       +o      specifying a filename containing a slash as an argument  to  the
              --pp option to the hhaasshh builtin command

       +o      importing  function  definitions  from  the shell environment at
              startup

       +o      parsing the value of SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS from  the  shell  environment  at
              startup

       +o      redirecting output using the >, >|, <>, >&, &>, and >> redirect-
              ion operators

       +o      using the eexxeecc builtin command to replace the shell with another
              command

       +o      adding  or  deleting builtin commands with the --ff and --dd options
              to the eennaabbllee builtin command

       +o      using the  eennaabbllee  builtin  command  to  enable  disabled  shell
              builtins

       +o      specifying the --pp option to the ccoommmmaanndd builtin command

       +o      turning  off  restricted  mode  with  sseett  ++rr  or  sshhoopptt  --uu rree--
              ssttrriicctteedd__sshheellll.

       These restrictions are enforced after any startup files are read.

       When a command that is found to be a shell script  is  executed,  rrbbaasshh
       turns off any restrictions in the shell spawned to execute the script.
