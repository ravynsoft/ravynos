       BBaasshh  is  an  sshh-compatible  command language interpreter that executes
       commands read from the standard input or from a file.  BBaasshh also incor-
       porates useful features from the _K_o_r_n and _C shells (kksshh and ccsshh).

       BBaasshh  is  intended  to  be a conformant implementation of the Shell and
       Utilities portion  of  the  IEEE  POSIX  specification  (IEEE  Standard
       1003.1).  BBaasshh can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All of the single-character shell options documented in the description
       of the sseett builtin command, including --oo, can be used as  options  when
       the  shell  is invoked.  In addition, bbaasshh interprets the following op-
       tions when it is invoked:

       --cc        If the --cc option is present, then commands are read from  the
                 first non-option argument _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___s_t_r_i_n_g.  If there are argu-
                 ments after the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d___s_t_r_i_n_g, the  first  argument  is  as-
                 signed  to $$00 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the
                 positional parameters.  The assignment to $$00 sets the name of
                 the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
       --ii        If the --ii option is present, the shell is _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e.
       --ll        Make bbaasshh act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see
                 IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN below).
       --rr        If the --rr option is present,  the  shell  becomes  _r_e_s_t_r_i_c_t_e_d
                 (see RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL below).
       --ss        If  the --ss option is present, or if no arguments remain after
                 option processing, then commands are read from  the  standard
                 input.   This  option  allows the positional parameters to be
                 set when invoking an interactive shell or when reading  input
                 through a pipe.
       --DD        A  list of all double-quoted strings preceded by $$ is printed
                 on the standard output.  These are the strings that are  sub-
                 ject to language translation when the current locale is not CC
                 or PPOOSSIIXX.  This implies the --nn option; no  commands  will  be
                 executed.
       [[--++]]OO [[_s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n]]
                 _s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n  is  one  of  the  shell options accepted by the
                 sshhoopptt  builtin  (see  SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  below).    If
                 _s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n is present, --OO sets the value of that option; ++OO
                 unsets it.  If _s_h_o_p_t___o_p_t_i_o_n is not supplied,  the  names  and
                 values  of the shell options accepted by sshhoopptt are printed on
                 the standard output.  If the invocation  option  is  ++OO,  the
                 output is displayed in a format that may be reused as input.
       ----        A  ----  signals the end of options and disables further option
                 processing.  Any arguments after the ---- are treated as  file-
                 names and arguments.  An argument of -- is equivalent to ----.

       BBaasshh  also  interprets  a number of multi-character options.  These op-
       tions must appear on the command line before the  single-character  op-
       tions to be recognized.

       ----ddeebbuuggggeerr
              Arrange for the debugger profile to be executed before the shell
              starts.  Turns on extended debugging mode (see  the  description
              of the eexxttddeebbuugg option to the sshhoopptt builtin below).
       ----dduummpp--ppoo--ssttrriinnggss
              Equivalent  to --DD, but the output is in the GNU _g_e_t_t_e_x_t ppoo (por-
              table object) file format.
       ----dduummpp--ssttrriinnggss
              Equivalent to --DD.
       ----hheellpp Display a usage message on standard  output  and  exit  success-
              fully.
       ----iinniitt--ffiillee _f_i_l_e
       ----rrccffiillee _f_i_l_e
              Execute commands from _f_i_l_e instead of the standard personal ini-
              tialization file _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c if the shell is interactive (see  IINN--
              VVOOCCAATTIIOONN below).

       ----llooggiinn
              Equivalent to --ll.

       ----nnooeeddiittiinngg
              Do  not  use the GNU rreeaaddlliinnee library to read command lines when
              the shell is interactive.

       ----nnoopprrooffiillee
              Do not read either the system-wide startup file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e  or
              any   of  the  personal  initialization  files  _~_/_._b_a_s_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e,
              _~_/_._b_a_s_h___l_o_g_i_n, or _~_/_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e.   By  default,  bbaasshh  reads  these
              files  when  it  is invoked as a login shell (see IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN be-
              low).

       ----nnoorrcc Do  not  read  and  execute  the  personal  initialization  file
              _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c if the shell is interactive.  This option is on by de-
              fault if the shell is invoked as sshh.

       ----ppoossiixx
              Change the behavior of bbaasshh where the default operation  differs
              from the POSIX standard to match the standard (_p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e).  See
              SSEEEE AALLSSOO below for a reference to a document  that  details  how
              posix mode affects bash's behavior.

       ----rreessttrriicctteedd
              The shell becomes restricted (see RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL below).

       ----vveerrbboossee
              Equivalent to --vv.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Show  version information for this instance of bbaasshh on the stan-
              dard output and exit successfully.

AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS
       If arguments remain after option processing, and neither the --cc nor the
       --ss  option  has  been supplied, the first argument is assumed to be the
       name of a file containing shell commands.  If bbaasshh is invoked  in  this
       fashion,  $$00 is set to the name of the file, and the positional parame-
       ters are set to the remaining arguments.  BBaasshh reads and executes  com-
       mands  from this file, then exits.  BBaasshh's exit status is the exit sta-
       tus of the last command executed in the script.  If no commands are ex-
       ecuted,  the  exit  status  is 0.  An attempt is first made to open the
       file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the shell
       searches the directories in PPAATTHH for the script.

IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN
       A  _l_o_g_i_n _s_h_e_l_l is one whose first character of argument zero is a --, or
       one started with the ----llooggiinn option.

       An _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e shell is one started without non-option  arguments  (un-
       less  --ss  is specified) and without the --cc option, whose standard input
       and error are both connected to terminals (as determined by _i_s_a_t_t_y(3)),
       or  one  started  with  the --ii option.  PPSS11 is set and $$-- includes ii if
       bbaasshh is interactive, allowing a shell script or a startup file to  test
       this state.

       The  following paragraphs describe how bbaasshh executes its startup files.
       If any of the files exist but cannot be read, bbaasshh  reports  an  error.
       Tildes  are expanded in filenames as described below under TTiillddee EExxppaann--
       ssiioonn in the EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN section.

       When bbaasshh is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a  non-inter-
       active  shell with the ----llooggiinn option, it first reads and executes com-
       mands from the file _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e, if that file exists.   After  reading
       that file, it looks for _~_/_._b_a_s_h___p_r_o_f_i_l_e, _~_/_._b_a_s_h___l_o_g_i_n, and _~_/_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e,
       in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one  that
       exists  and  is  readable.  The ----nnoopprrooffiillee option may be used when the
       shell is started to inhibit this behavior.

       When an interactive login shell exits, or a non-interactive login shell
       executes  the  eexxiitt  builtin  command, bbaasshh reads and executes commands
       from the file _~_/_._b_a_s_h___l_o_g_o_u_t, if it exists.

       When an interactive shell that is not a login shell  is  started,  bbaasshh
       reads  and executes commands from _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c, if that file exists.  This
       may be inhibited by using the ----nnoorrcc option.  The ----rrccffiillee _f_i_l_e  option
       will  force  bbaasshh  to  read  and  execute commands from _f_i_l_e instead of
       _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c.

       When bbaasshh is started non-interactively, to run a shell script, for  ex-
       ample,  it  looks for the variable BBAASSHH__EENNVV in the environment, expands
       its value if it appears there, and uses the expanded value as the  name
       of  a  file to read and execute.  BBaasshh behaves as if the following com-
       mand were executed:
              if [ -n "$BASH_ENV" ]; then . "$BASH_ENV"; fi
       but the value of the PPAATTHH variable is not used to search for the  file-
       name.

       If  bbaasshh is invoked with the name sshh, it tries to mimic the startup be-
       havior of historical versions of sshh as closely as possible, while  con-
       forming  to the POSIX standard as well.  When invoked as an interactive
       login shell, or a non-interactive shell with  the  ----llooggiinn  option,  it
       first  attempts  to  read  and  execute  commands from _/_e_t_c_/_p_r_o_f_i_l_e and
       _~_/_._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, in that order.  The ----nnoopprrooffiillee option may be used  to  in-
       hibit  this  behavior.   When  invoked as an interactive shell with the
       name sshh, bbaasshh looks for the variable EENNVV, expands its value  if  it  is
       defined,  and uses the expanded value as the name of a file to read and
       execute.  Since a shell invoked as sshh does not attempt to read and exe-
       cute  commands from any other startup files, the ----rrccffiillee option has no
       effect.  A non-interactive shell invoked with the name sshh does not  at-
       tempt to read any other startup files.  When invoked as sshh, bbaasshh enters
       _p_o_s_i_x mode after the startup files are read.

       When bbaasshh is started in _p_o_s_i_x mode, as with the  ----ppoossiixx  command  line
       option, it follows the POSIX standard for startup files.  In this mode,
       interactive shells expand the EENNVV variable and commands  are  read  and
       executed  from  the  file  whose  name is the expanded value.  No other
       startup files are read.

       BBaasshh attempts to determine when it is being run with its standard input
       connected  to  a network connection, as when executed by the historical
       remote shell daemon, usually _r_s_h_d, or the secure shell daemon _s_s_h_d.  If
       bbaasshh  determines  it is being run non-interactively in this fashion, it
       reads and executes commands from _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c, if that file exists and  is
       readable.  It will not do this if invoked as sshh.  The ----nnoorrcc option may
       be used to inhibit this behavior, and the ----rrccffiillee option may  be  used
       to  force  another file to be read, but neither _r_s_h_d nor _s_s_h_d generally
       invoke the shell with those options or allow them to be specified.

       If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to
       the real user (group) id, and the --pp option is not supplied, no startup
       files are read, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
       the  SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS, BBAASSHHOOPPTTSS, CCDDPPAATTHH, and GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE variables, if they ap-
       pear in the environment, are ignored, and the effective user id is  set
       to  the  real user id.  If the --pp option is supplied at invocation, the
       startup behavior is the same, but the effective user id is not reset.

SSHHEELLLL GGRRAAMMMMAARR
       This  section  describes  the syntax of the various forms of shell com-
       mands.

   SSiimmppllee CCoommmmaannddss
       A _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is a sequence of optional  variable  assignments  fol-
       lowed  by  bbllaannkk-separated  words and redirections, and terminated by a
       _c_o_n_t_r_o_l _o_p_e_r_a_t_o_r.  The first word specifies the command to be executed,
       and  is passed as argument zero.  The remaining words are passed as ar-
       guments to the invoked command.

       The return value of a _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is its exit status,  or  128+_n  if
       the command is terminated by signal _n.

   PPiippeelliinneess
       A  _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e  is  a sequence of one or more commands separated by one of
       the control operators || or ||&&.  The format for a pipeline is:

              [ttiimmee [--pp]] [ ! ] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 [ [|||||&&] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2 ... ]

       The standard output of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 is connected via a pipe to the standard
       input  of  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2.   This connection is performed before any redirec-
       tions specified by the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1(see RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN below).  If ||&& is used,
       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1's  standard error, in addition to its standard output, is con-
       nected to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2's standard input through the pipe; it  is  shorthand
       for  22>>&&11  ||.   This  implicit redirection of the standard error to the
       standard output is performed after any redirections specified  by  _c_o_m_-
       _m_a_n_d_1.

       The return status of a pipeline is the exit status of the last command,
       unless the ppiippeeffaaiill option is enabled.  If  ppiippeeffaaiill  is  enabled,  the
       pipeline's  return  status is the value of the last (rightmost) command
       to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands  exit  success-
       fully.  If the reserved word !!  precedes a pipeline, the exit status of
       that pipeline is the logical negation of the exit status  as  described
       above.   The  shell waits for all commands in the pipeline to terminate
       before returning a value.

       If the ttiimmee reserved word precedes a pipeline, the elapsed as  well  as
       user  and  system  time consumed by its execution are reported when the
       pipeline terminates.  The --pp option changes the output format  to  that
       specified  by POSIX.  When the shell is in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, it does not rec-
       ognize ttiimmee as a reserved word if the next token  begins  with  a  `-'.
       The  TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT  variable  may be set to a format string that specifies
       how the timing information should be displayed; see the description  of
       TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT under SShheellll VVaarriiaabblleess below.

       When the shell is in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, ttiimmee may be followed by a newline.  In
       this case, the shell displays the total user and system  time  consumed
       by  the shell and its children.  The TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT variable may be used to
       specify the format of the time information.

       Each command in a multi-command pipeline, where pipes are  created,  is
       executed  in a _s_u_b_s_h_e_l_l, which is a separate process.  See CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEE--
       CCUUTTIIOONN EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT for a description of subshells and a subshell  envi-
       ronment.   If  the  llaassttppiippee  option is enabled using the sshhoopptt builtin
       (see the description of sshhoopptt below), the last element  of  a  pipeline
       may be run by the shell process when job control is not active.

   LLiissttss
       A  _l_i_s_t  is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by one of the
       operators ;;, &&, &&&&, or ||||, and optionally terminated by one of ;;, &&, or
       <<nneewwlliinnee>>.

       Of these list operators, &&&& and |||| have equal precedence, followed by ;;
       and &&, which have equal precedence.

       A sequence of one or more newlines may appear in a _l_i_s_t  instead  of  a
       semicolon to delimit commands.

       If  a  command  is terminated by the control operator &&, the shell exe-
       cutes the command in the _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d in a subshell.  The shell does  not
       wait  for the command to finish, and the return status is 0.  These are
       referred to as _a_s_y_n_c_h_r_o_n_o_u_s commands.  Commands separated by  a  ;;  are
       executed sequentially; the shell waits for each command to terminate in
       turn.  The return status is the exit status of the  last  command  exe-
       cuted.

       AND  and  OR  lists are sequences of one or more pipelines separated by
       the &&&& and |||| control operators, respectively.  AND and  OR  lists  are
       executed with left associativity.  An AND list has the form

              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 &&&& _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2

       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2  is  executed if, and only if, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 returns an exit status
       of zero (success).

       An OR list has the form

              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 |||| _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2

       _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_2 is executed if, and only if, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_1 returns a non-zero  exit
       status.   The  return  status of AND and OR lists is the exit status of
       the last command executed in the list.

       A _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is one of the following.  In most cases a _l_i_s_t in  a
       command's  description may be separated from the rest of the command by
       one or more newlines, and may be followed by a newline in  place  of  a
       semicolon.

       (_l_i_s_t) _l_i_s_t  is  executed in a subshell (see CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN EENNVVIIRROONN--
              MMEENNTT below for a description of a subshell environment).   Vari-
              able  assignments  and  builtin commands that affect the shell's
              environment do not remain in effect after the command completes.
              The return status is the exit status of _l_i_s_t.

       { _l_i_s_t; }
              _l_i_s_t  is simply executed in the current shell environment.  _l_i_s_t
              must be terminated with a newline or semicolon.  This  is  known
              as  a  _g_r_o_u_p  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.   The return status is the exit status of
              _l_i_s_t.  Note that unlike the metacharacters (( and )), {{ and }}  are
              _r_e_s_e_r_v_e_d _w_o_r_d_s and must occur where a reserved word is permitted
              to be recognized.  Since they do not cause a  word  break,  they
              must  be  separated  from  _l_i_s_t  by  whitespace or another shell
              metacharacter.

       ((_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n))
              The _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is evaluated according to the rules described be-
              low under AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN.  If the value of the expression
              is non-zero, the return status is 0; otherwise the return status
              is  1.   The  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n  undergoes the same expansions as if it
              were within double quotes, but double quote  characters  in  _e_x_-
              _p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n are not treated specially and are removed.

       [[[[ _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ]]]]
              Return  a  status  of  0 or 1 depending on the evaluation of the
              conditional expression _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  Expressions are composed  of
              the  primaries  described  below  under CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS.
              The words between the [[[[ and ]]]] do not  undergo  word  splitting
              and pathname expansion.  The shell performs tilde expansion, pa-
              rameter and variable expansion,  arithmetic  expansion,  command
              substitution,  process  substitution, and quote removal on those
              words (the expansions that would occur if  the  words  were  en-
              closed in double quotes).  Conditional operators such as --ff must
              be unquoted to be recognized as primaries.

              When used with [[[[, the << and >> operators sort  lexicographically
              using the current locale.

              When  the  ==== and !!== operators are used, the string to the right
              of the operator is considered a pattern and matched according to
              the rules described below under PPaatttteerrnn MMaattcchhiinngg, as if the eexxtt--
              gglloobb shell option were enabled.  The == operator is equivalent to
              ====.   If  the  nnooccaasseemmaattcchh shell option is enabled, the match is
              performed without regard to the case of  alphabetic  characters.
              The  return  value  is  0 if the string matches (====) or does not
              match (!!==) the pattern, and 1 otherwise.  Any part of  the  pat-
              tern  may be quoted to force the quoted portion to be matched as
              a string.

              An additional binary operator, ==~~, is available, with  the  same
              precedence  as  ====  and  !!==.  When it is used, the string to the
              right of the operator is considered a POSIX extended regular ex-
              pression  and  matched  accordingly (using the POSIX _r_e_g_c_o_m_p and
              _r_e_g_e_x_e_c interfaces usually described in _r_e_g_e_x(3)).   The  return
              value  is  0 if the string matches the pattern, and 1 otherwise.
              If the regular expression is syntactically incorrect, the condi-
              tional expression's return value is 2.  If the nnooccaasseemmaattcchh shell
              option is enabled, the match is performed without regard to  the
              case  of  alphabetic  characters.  If any part of the pattern is
              quoted, the quoted portion is matched literally.  This means ev-
              ery  character  in the quoted portion matches itself, instead of
              having any special pattern matching meaning.  If the pattern  is
              stored  in  a  shell  variable,  quoting  the variable expansion
              forces the  entire  pattern  to  be  matched  literally.   Treat
              bracket expressions in regular expressions carefully, since nor-
              mal quoting and pattern characters lose their  meanings  between
              brackets.

              The  pattern  will  match  if it matches any part of the string.
              Anchor the pattern using the ^^ and $$ regular  expression  opera-
              tors to force it to match the entire string.  The array variable
              BBAASSHH__RREEMMAATTCCHH records which parts of the string matched the  pat-
              tern.   The  element  of  BBAASSHH__RREEMMAATTCCHH with index 0 contains the
              portion of the string matching the  entire  regular  expression.
              Substrings  matched  by  parenthesized subexpressions within the
              regular expression are saved in the remaining  BBAASSHH__RREEMMAATTCCHH  in-
              dices.  The  element of BBAASSHH__RREEMMAATTCCHH with index _n is the portion
              of the string  matching  the  _nth  parenthesized  subexpression.
              Bash  sets  BBAASSHH__RREEMMAATTCCHH  in the global scope; declaring it as a
              local variable will lead to unexpected results.

              Expressions may  be  combined  using  the  following  operators,
              listed in decreasing order of precedence:

              (( _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n ))
                     Returns  the  value  of  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  This may be used to
                     override the normal precedence of operators.
              !! _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
                     True if _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is false.
              _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 &&&& _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2
                     True if both _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 and _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 are true.
              _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 |||| _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2
                     True if either _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1 or _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 is true.

              The &&&& and |||| operators do not evaluate _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_2 if the value
              of  _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_1  is  sufficient to determine the return value of
              the entire conditional expression.

       ffoorr _n_a_m_e [ [ iinn [ _w_o_r_d _._._. ] ] ; ] ddoo _l_i_s_t ; ddoonnee
              The list of words following iinn is expanded, generating a list of
              items.  The variable _n_a_m_e is set to each element of this list in
              turn, and _l_i_s_t is executed each time.  If the iinn _w_o_r_d  is  omit-
              ted,  the ffoorr command executes _l_i_s_t once for each positional pa-
              rameter that is set (see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS below).  The  return  status
              is  the  exit  status of the last command that executes.  If the
              expansion of the items following iinn results in an empty list, no
              commands are executed, and the return status is 0.

       ffoorr (( _e_x_p_r_1 ; _e_x_p_r_2 ; _e_x_p_r_3 )) ; ddoo _l_i_s_t ; ddoonnee
              First, the arithmetic expression _e_x_p_r_1 is evaluated according to
              the rules described  below  under  AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC  EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN.   The
              arithmetic  expression  _e_x_p_r_2 is then evaluated repeatedly until
              it evaluates to zero.  Each time _e_x_p_r_2 evaluates to  a  non-zero
              value,  _l_i_s_t  is executed and the arithmetic expression _e_x_p_r_3 is
              evaluated.  If any expression is omitted, it behaves  as  if  it
              evaluates to 1.  The return value is the exit status of the last
              command in _l_i_s_t that is executed, or false if any of the expres-
              sions is invalid.

       sseelleecctt _n_a_m_e [ iinn _w_o_r_d ] ; ddoo _l_i_s_t ; ddoonnee
              The list of words following iinn is expanded, generating a list of
              items, and the set of expanded words is printed on the  standard
              error,  each  preceded  by a number.  If the iinn _w_o_r_d is omitted,
              the positional parameters are printed  (see  PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS  below).
              sseelleecctt  then  displays  the PPSS33 prompt and reads a line from the
              standard input.  If the line consists of a number  corresponding
              to  one of the displayed words, then the value of _n_a_m_e is set to
              that word.  If the line is empty, the words and prompt are  dis-
              played  again.  If EOF is read, the sseelleecctt command completes and
              returns 1.  Any other value read causes _n_a_m_e to be set to  null.
              The  line read is saved in the variable RREEPPLLYY.  The _l_i_s_t is exe-
              cuted after each selection until a bbrreeaakk  command  is  executed.
              The exit status of sseelleecctt is the exit status of the last command
              executed in _l_i_s_t, or zero if no commands were executed.

       ccaassee _w_o_r_d iinn [ [(] _p_a_t_t_e_r_n [ || _p_a_t_t_e_r_n ] ... ) _l_i_s_t ;; ] ... eessaacc
              A ccaassee command first expands _w_o_r_d, and tries to match it against
              each  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  in turn, using the matching rules described under
              PPaatttteerrnn MMaattcchhiinngg below.  The _w_o_r_d is expanded using tilde expan-
              sion,  parameter  and  variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,
              command substitution, process substitution  and  quote  removal.
              Each _p_a_t_t_e_r_n examined is expanded using tilde expansion, parame-
              ter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion,  command  sub-
              stitution,  process substitution, and quote removal.  If the nnoo--
              ccaasseemmaattcchh shell option is enabled, the match is performed  with-
              out  regard  to the case of alphabetic characters.  When a match
              is found, the corresponding _l_i_s_t is executed.  If the ;;;;  opera-
              tor is used, no subsequent matches are attempted after the first
              pattern match.  Using ;;&& in place of ;;;; causes execution to con-
              tinue  with  the  _l_i_s_t associated with the next set of patterns.
              Using ;;;;&& in place of ;;;; causes the shell to test the next  pat-
              tern  list  in the statement, if any, and execute any associated
              _l_i_s_t on a successful match, continuing the case statement execu-
              tion as if the pattern list had not matched.  The exit status is
              zero if no pattern matches.  Otherwise, it is the exit status of
              the last command executed in _l_i_s_t.

              The  iiff  _l_i_s_t is executed.  If its exit status is zero, the tthheenn
              _l_i_s_t is executed.  Otherwise, each  eelliiff  _l_i_s_t  is  executed  in
              turn,  and  if  its  exit status is zero, the corresponding tthheenn
              _l_i_s_t is executed and the command completes.  Otherwise, the eellssee
              _l_i_s_t  is executed, if present.  The exit status is the exit sta-
              tus of the last command executed, or zero if no condition tested
              true.

              The  wwhhiillee command continuously executes the list _l_i_s_t_-_2 as long
              as the last command in the list _l_i_s_t_-_1 returns an exit status of
              zero.   The uunnttiill command is identical to the wwhhiillee command, ex-
              cept that the test is negated: _l_i_s_t_-_2 is executed as long as the
              last command in _l_i_s_t_-_1 returns a non-zero exit status.  The exit
              status of the wwhhiillee and uunnttiill commands is the exit status of the
              last command executed in _l_i_s_t_-_2, or zero if none was executed.

   CCoopprroocceesssseess
       A _c_o_p_r_o_c_e_s_s is a shell command preceded by the ccoopprroocc reserved word.  A
       coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if  the  command
       had  been  terminated  with the && control operator, with a two-way pipe
       established between the executing shell and the coprocess.

       The syntax for a coprocess is:

              ccoopprroocc [_N_A_M_E] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n_s]

       This creates a coprocess named _N_A_M_E.  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d may be  either  a  simple
       command  or  a  compound command (see above).  _N_A_M_E is a shell variable
       name.  If _N_A_M_E is not supplied, the default name is CCOOPPRROOCC.

       The recommended form to use for a coprocess is

              ccoopprroocc _N_A_M_E { _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n_s]; }

       This form is recommended because simple commands result in  the  copro-
       cess  always being named CCOOPPRROOCC, and it is simpler to use and more com-
       plete than the other compound commands.

       If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is a compound command, _N_A_M_E is optional. The word  following
       ccoopprroocc  determines whether that word is interpreted as a variable name:
       it is interpreted as _N_A_M_E if it is not a reserved word that  introduces
       a  compound  command.   If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is a simple command, _N_A_M_E is not al-
       lowed; this is to avoid confusion between _N_A_M_E and the  first  word  of
       the simple command.

       When  the  coprocess  is  executed, the shell creates an array variable
       (see AArrrraayyss below) named _N_A_M_E in the context of  the  executing  shell.
       The  standard  output  of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is connected via a pipe to a file de-
       scriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor  is  assigned
       to _N_A_M_E[0].  The standard input of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is connected via a pipe to a
       file descriptor in the executing shell, and that file descriptor is as-
       signed  to  _N_A_M_E[1].   This pipe is established before any redirections
       specified by the command (see RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN below).  The file descriptors
       can  be  utilized as arguments to shell commands and redirections using
       standard word expansions.  Other than those created to execute  command
       and  process  substitutions,  the file descriptors are not available in
       subshells.

       The process ID of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is  avail-
       able  as  the value of the variable _N_A_M_E_PID.  The wwaaiitt builtin command
       may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.

       Since the coprocess is created as an asynchronous command,  the  ccoopprroocc
       command  always  returns  success.  The return status of a coprocess is
       the exit status of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

   SShheellll FFuunnccttiioonn DDeeffiinniittiioonnss
       A shell function is an object that is called like a simple command  and
       executes  a  compound  command with a new set of positional parameters.
       Shell functions are declared as follows:

       _f_n_a_m_e () _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n]
       ffuunnccttiioonn _f_n_a_m_e [()] _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n]
              This defines a function named _f_n_a_m_e.  The reserved word ffuunnccttiioonn
              is  optional.   If  the  ffuunnccttiioonn reserved word is supplied, the
              parentheses are optional.  The _b_o_d_y of the function is the  com-
              pound  command  _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d  (see CCoommppoouunndd CCoommmmaannddss above).
              That command is usually a _l_i_s_t of commands between { and },  but
              may be any command listed under CCoommppoouunndd CCoommmmaannddss above.  If the
              ffuunnccttiioonn reserved word is used, but the parentheses are not sup-
              plied, the braces are recommended.  _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed
              whenever _f_n_a_m_e is specified as the name  of  a  simple  command.
              When in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, _f_n_a_m_e must be a valid shell _n_a_m_e and may not
              be the name of one of the POSIX _s_p_e_c_i_a_l  _b_u_i_l_t_i_n_s.   In  default
              mode,  a  function name can be any unquoted shell word that does
              not contain $$.  Any redirections (see RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN below)  speci-
              fied  when a function is defined are performed when the function
              is executed.  The exit status of a function definition  is  zero
              unless  a  syntax  error  occurs or a readonly function with the
              same name already exists.  When executed, the exit status  of  a
              function  is the exit status of the last command executed in the
              body.  (See FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS below.)

CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS
       In a non-interactive shell, or an interactive shell in which the iinntteerr--
       aaccttiivvee__ccoommmmeennttss  option  to  the  sshhoopptt  builtin  is enabled (see SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below), a word beginning with ## causes that  word  and
       all  remaining  characters  on that line to be ignored.  An interactive
       shell without the iinntteerraaccttiivvee__ccoommmmeennttss option enabled  does  not  allow
       comments.  The iinntteerraaccttiivvee__ccoommmmeennttss option is on by default in interac-
       tive shells.

QQUUOOTTIINNGG
       _Q_u_o_t_i_n_g is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters  or
       words  to  the shell.  Quoting can be used to disable special treatment
       for special characters, to prevent reserved words from being recognized
       as such, and to prevent parameter expansion.

       Each  of  the _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s listed above under DDEEFFIINNIITTIIOONNSS has special
       meaning to the shell and must be quoted if it is to represent itself.

       When the command history expansion facilities are being used (see  HHIISS--
       TTOORRYY EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN below), the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n character, usually !!, must
       be quoted to prevent history expansion.

       There are  three  quoting  mechanisms:  the  _e_s_c_a_p_e  _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r,  single
       quotes, and double quotes.

       A  non-quoted  backslash (\\) is the _e_s_c_a_p_e _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r.  It preserves the
       literal value of the next character that follows, with the exception of
       <newline>.   If a \\<newline> pair appears, and the backslash is not it-
       self quoted, the \\<newline> is treated as a line continuation (that is,
       it is removed from the input stream and effectively ignored).

       Enclosing  characters  in  single quotes preserves the literal value of
       each character within the quotes.  A single quote may not occur between
       single quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.

       Enclosing  characters  in  double quotes preserves the literal value of
       all characters within the quotes, with the exception of $$, ``,  \\,  and,
       when history expansion is enabled, !!.  When the shell is in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e,
       the !! has no special meaning within double quotes,  even  when  history
       expansion  is  enabled.   The  characters  $$ and `` retain their special
       meaning within double quotes.  The backslash retains its special  mean-
       ing  only when followed by one of the following characters: $$, ``, "", \\,
       or <<nneewwlliinnee>>.  A double quote may be quoted  within  double  quotes  by
       preceding  it  with a backslash.  If enabled, history expansion will be
       performed unless an !!  appearing in double quotes is  escaped  using  a
       backslash.  The backslash preceding the !!  is not removed.

       The  special  parameters  **  and  @@ have special meaning when in double
       quotes (see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS below).

       Character sequences of the form $$'_s_t_r_i_n_g'  are  treated  as  a  special
       variant  of  single quotes.  The sequence expands to _s_t_r_i_n_g, with back-
       slash-escaped characters in _s_t_r_i_n_g replaced as specified by the ANSI  C
       standard.   Backslash escape sequences, if present, are decoded as fol-
       lows:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\ee
              \\EE     an escape character
              \\ff     form feed
              \\nn     new line
              \\rr     carriage return
              \\tt     horizontal tab
              \\vv     vertical tab
              \\\\     backslash
              \\''     single quote
              \\""     double quote
              \\??     question mark
              \\_n_n_n   the eight-bit character whose value is  the  octal  value
                     _n_n_n (one to three octal digits)
              \\xx_H_H   the  eight-bit  character  whose value is the hexadecimal
                     value _H_H (one or two hex digits)
              \\uu_H_H_H_H the Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is  the
                     hexadecimal value _H_H_H_H (one to four hex digits)
              \\UU_H_H_H_H_H_H_H_H
                     the  Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character whose value is the
                     hexadecimal value _H_H_H_H_H_H_H_H (one to eight hex digits)
              \\cc_x    a control-_x character

       The expanded result is single-quoted, as if the  dollar  sign  had  not
       been present.

       A double-quoted string preceded by a dollar sign ($$"_s_t_r_i_n_g") will cause
       the string to be translated according to the current locale.  The  _g_e_t_-
       _t_e_x_t  infrastructure  performs  the  lookup  and translation, using the
       LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS, TTEEXXTTDDOOMMAAIINNDDIIRR, and TTEEXXTTDDOOMMAAIINN  shell  variables.   If  the
       current  locale  is CC or PPOOSSIIXX, if there are no translations available,
       or if the string is not translated, the dollar sign is  ignored.   This
       is a form of double quoting, so the string remains double-quoted by de-
       fault, whether or not it is translated  and  replaced.   If  the  nnooeexx--
       ppaanndd__ttrraannssllaattiioonn  option is enabled using the sshhoopptt builtin, translated
       strings are single-quoted instead of double-quoted.  See  the  descrip-
       tion of sshhoopptt below under SSHHEELLLLBUILTINCCOOMMMMAANNDDSS.

PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS
       A  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an entity that stores values.  It can be a _n_a_m_e, a num-
       ber, or one of the special characters listed below under SSppeecciiaall PPaarraamm--
       eetteerrss.   A _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e is a parameter denoted by a _n_a_m_e.  A variable has a
       _v_a_l_u_e and zero or more _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e_s.  Attributes are assigned  using  the
       ddeeccllaarree builtin command (see ddeeccllaarree below in SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS).

       A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is
       a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only  by  using
       the uunnsseett builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       A _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e may be assigned to by a statement of the form

              _n_a_m_e=[_v_a_l_u_e]

       If  _v_a_l_u_e  is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All
       _v_a_l_u_e_s undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,  com-
       mand  substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal (see EEXXPPAANN--
       SSIIOONN below).  If the variable has its iinntteeggeerr attribute set, then _v_a_l_u_e
       is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion
       is not used (see AArriitthhmmeettiicc EExxppaannssiioonn below).  Word splitting and path-
       name  expansion  are not performed.  Assignment statements may also ap-
       pear as arguments to the aalliiaass, ddeeccllaarree, ttyyppeesseett, eexxppoorrtt, rreeaaddoonnllyy, and
       llooccaall  builtin  commands  (_d_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_o_n  commands).  When in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e,
       these builtins may appear in a command after one or more  instances  of
       the ccoommmmaanndd builtin and retain these assignment statement properties.

       In  the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a
       shell variable or array index, the += operator can be used to append to
       or  add  to  the variable's previous value.  This includes arguments to
       builtin commands such as  ddeeccllaarree  that  accept  assignment  statements
       (_d_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_o_n commands).  When += is applied to a variable for which the
       iinntteeggeerr attribute has been set, _v_a_l_u_e is evaluated as an arithmetic ex-
       pression and added to the variable's current value, which is also eval-
       uated.  When += is applied to an array variable using compound  assign-
       ment  (see  AArrrraayyss  below), the variable's value is not unset (as it is
       when using =), and new values are appended to the  array  beginning  at
       one  greater  than  the  array's  maximum index (for indexed arrays) or
       added as additional key-value pairs in an associative array.  When  ap-
       plied  to  a  string-valued variable, _v_a_l_u_e is expanded and appended to
       the variable's value.

       A variable can be assigned the _n_a_m_e_r_e_f attribute using the --nn option to
       the  ddeeccllaarree or llooccaall builtin commands (see the descriptions of ddeeccllaarree
       and llooccaall below) to create a _n_a_m_e_r_e_f, or a reference to  another  vari-
       able.   This  allows  variables to be manipulated indirectly.  Whenever
       the nameref variable is referenced, assigned to, unset, or has its  at-
       tributes  modified  (other than using or changing the _n_a_m_e_r_e_f attribute
       itself), the operation is actually performed on the variable  specified
       by  the  nameref  variable's  value.  A nameref is commonly used within
       shell functions to refer to a variable whose name is passed as an argu-
       ment  to the function.  For instance, if a variable name is passed to a
       shell function as its first argument, running
              declare -n ref=$1
       inside the function creates a nameref variable rreeff whose value  is  the
       variable name passed as the first argument.  References and assignments
       to rreeff, and changes to its attributes, are treated as  references,  as-
       signments,  and  attribute modifications to the variable whose name was
       passed as $$11.  If the control variable in a ffoorr loop  has  the  nameref
       attribute,  the  list  of words can be a list of shell variables, and a
       name reference will be established for each word in the list, in  turn,
       when the loop is executed.  Array variables cannot be given the nnaammeerreeff
       attribute.  However, nameref variables can  reference  array  variables
       and  subscripted  array  variables.  Namerefs can be unset using the --nn
       option to the uunnsseett builtin.  Otherwise, if uunnsseett is executed with  the
       name  of  a nameref variable as an argument, the variable referenced by
       the nameref variable will be unset.

   PPoossiittiioonnaall PPaarraammeetteerrss
       A _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n_a_l _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is a parameter denoted by one  or  more  digits,
       other than the single digit 0.  Positional parameters are assigned from
       the shell's arguments when it is invoked, and may be  reassigned  using
       the  sseett builtin command.  Positional parameters may not be assigned to
       with assignment statements.  The positional parameters are  temporarily
       replaced when a shell function is executed (see FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS below).

       When  a  positional parameter consisting of more than a single digit is
       expanded, it must be enclosed in braces (see EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN below).

   SSppeecciiaall PPaarraammeetteerrss
       The shell treats several parameters specially.   These  parameters  may
       only be referenced; assignment to them is not allowed.
       **      Expands  to  the positional parameters, starting from one.  When
              the expansion is not within double quotes, each  positional  pa-
              rameter  expands  to  a  separate word.  In contexts where it is
              performed, those words are subject to further word splitting and
              pathname  expansion.   When  the  expansion occurs within double
              quotes, it expands to a single word with the value of  each  pa-
              rameter  separated  by  the  first  character of the IIFFSS special
              variable.  That is, "$$**" is equivalent to "$$11_c$$22_c......",  where  _c
              is the first character of the value of the IIFFSS variable.  If IIFFSS
              is unset, the parameters are separated by  spaces.   If  IIFFSS  is
              null, the parameters are joined without intervening separators.
       @@      Expands  to  the  positional  parameters, starting from one.  In
              contexts where word splitting is performed,  this  expands  each
              positional  parameter  to  a separate word; if not within double
              quotes, these words are subject to word splitting.  In  contexts
              where  word splitting is not performed, this expands to a single
              word with each positional parameter separated by a space.   When
              the  expansion  occurs  within double quotes, each parameter ex-
              pands to a separate word.  That is, "$$@@" is equivalent  to  "$$11"
              "$$22"  ...   If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word,
              the expansion of the first parameter is joined with  the  begin-
              ning  part  of  the original word, and the expansion of the last
              parameter is joined with the last part  of  the  original  word.
              When  there  are no positional parameters, "$$@@" and $$@@ expand to
              nothing (i.e., they are removed).
       ##      Expands to the number of positional parameters in decimal.
       ??      Expands to the exit status of the most recently  executed  fore-
              ground pipeline.
       --      Expands  to  the  current option flags as specified upon invoca-
              tion, by the sseett builtin command, or those set by the shell  it-
              self (such as the --ii option).
       $$      Expands  to  the  process ID of the shell. In a subshell, it ex-
              pands to the process ID of the current shell, not the subshell.
       !!      Expands to the process ID of the job most recently  placed  into
              the  background,  whether executed as an asynchronous command or
              using the bbgg builtin (see JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL below).
       00      Expands to the name of the shell or shell script.  This  is  set
              at shell initialization.  If bbaasshh is invoked with a file of com-
              mands, $$00 is set to the name of that file.  If bbaasshh  is  started
              with  the  --cc option, then $$00 is set to the first argument after
              the string to be executed, if one is present.  Otherwise, it  is
              set  to  the  filename used to invoke bbaasshh, as given by argument
              zero.

   SShheellll VVaarriiaabblleess
       The following variables are set by the shell:

       __      At shell startup, set to the pathname used to invoke  the  shell
              or  shell  script being executed as passed in the environment or
              argument list.  Subsequently, expands to the  last  argument  to
              the  previous  simple  command executed in the foreground, after
              expansion.  Also set to the full pathname used  to  invoke  each
              command  executed and placed in the environment exported to that
              command.  When checking mail, this parameter holds the  name  of
              the mail file currently being checked.
       BBAASSHH   Expands  to  the  full  filename used to invoke this instance of
              bbaasshh.
       BBAASSHHOOPPTTSS
              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each  word  in
              the  list  is  a  valid  argument for the --ss option to the sshhoopptt
              builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  The options
              appearing  in  BBAASSHHOOPPTTSS  are  those reported as _o_n by sshhoopptt.  If
              this variable is in the environment when bbaasshh  starts  up,  each
              shell  option  in  the  list  will be enabled before reading any
              startup files.  This variable is read-only.
       BBAASSHHPPIIDD
              Expands to the process ID of the  current  bbaasshh  process.   This
              differs  from  $$$$ under certain circumstances, such as subshells
              that do not require bbaasshh to be re-initialized.   Assignments  to
              BBAASSHHPPIIDD  have no effect.  If BBAASSHHPPIIDD is unset, it loses its spe-
              cial properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BBAASSHH__AALLIIAASSEESS
              An associative array variable whose members  correspond  to  the
              internal  list  of  aliases  as maintained by the aalliiaass builtin.
              Elements added to this array appear in the alias list;  however,
              unsetting  array elements currently does not cause aliases to be
              removed from the alias list.  If BBAASSHH__AALLIIAASSEESS is unset, it loses
              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BBAASSHH__AARRGGCC
              An  array  variable whose values are the number of parameters in
              each frame of the current bbaasshh execution call stack.  The number
              of  parameters  to  the  current  subroutine  (shell function or
              script executed with .. or ssoouurrccee) is at the top  of  the  stack.
              When  a  subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed
              is pushed onto BBAASSHH__AARRGGCC.  The shell sets BBAASSHH__AARRGGCC only when in
              extended debugging mode (see the description of the eexxttddeebbuugg op-
              tion to the sshhoopptt builtin below).  Setting  eexxttddeebbuugg  after  the
              shell has started to execute a script, or referencing this vari-
              able when eexxttddeebbuugg is not set, may result in  inconsistent  val-
              ues.
       BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV
              An  array  variable containing all of the parameters in the cur-
              rent bbaasshh execution call stack.  The final parameter of the last
              subroutine  call is at the top of the stack; the first parameter
              of the initial call is at the bottom.  When a subroutine is exe-
              cuted,  the  parameters supplied are pushed onto BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV.  The
              shell sets BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV only when in extended debugging  mode  (see
              the  description of the eexxttddeebbuugg option to the sshhoopptt builtin be-
              low).  Setting eexxttddeebbuugg after the shell has started to execute a
              script,  or  referencing this variable when eexxttddeebbuugg is not set,
              may result in inconsistent values.
       BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV00
              When referenced, this variable expands to the name of the  shell
              or shell script (identical to $$00; see the description of special
              parameter 0 above).  Assignment to BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV00 causes  the  value
              assigned  to also be assigned to $$00.  If BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV00 is unset, it
              loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BBAASSHH__CCMMDDSS
              An associative array variable whose members  correspond  to  the
              internal  hash  table  of  commands  as  maintained  by the hhaasshh
              builtin.  Elements added to this array appear in the hash table;
              however,  unsetting array elements currently does not cause com-
              mand names to be removed from the hash table.  If  BBAASSHH__CCMMDDSS  is
              unset,  it  loses  its  special properties, even if it is subse-
              quently reset.
       BBAASSHH__CCOOMMMMAANNDD
              The command currently being executed or about  to  be  executed,
              unless the shell is executing a command as the result of a trap,
              in which case it is the command executing at  the  time  of  the
              trap.   If  BBAASSHH__CCOOMMMMAANNDD  is unset, it loses its special proper-
              ties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BBAASSHH__EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN__SSTTRRIINNGG
              The command argument to the --cc invocation option.
       BBAASSHH__LLIINNEENNOO
              An array variable whose members are the line numbers  in  source
              files  where  each corresponding member of FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE was invoked.
              $${{BBAASSHH__LLIINNEENNOO[[_$_i]]}}  is  the  line  number  in  the  source  file
              ($${{BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE[[_$_i_+_1]]}})  where  $${{FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE[[_$_i]]}}  was  called  (or
              $${{BBAASSHH__LLIINNEENNOO[[_$_i_-_1]]}} if referenced within  another  shell  func-
              tion).  Use LLIINNEENNOO to obtain the current line number.
       BBAASSHH__LLOOAADDAABBLLEESS__PPAATTHH
              A  colon-separated  list of directories in which the shell looks
              for dynamically loadable builtins specified by the  eennaabbllee  com-
              mand.
       BBAASSHH__RREEMMAATTCCHH
              An  array  variable  whose members are assigned by the ==~~ binary
              operator to the [[[[ conditional command.  The element with  index
              0  is  the portion of the string matching the entire regular ex-
              pression.  The element with index _n is the portion of the string
              matching the _nth parenthesized subexpression.
       BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE
              An  array  variable whose members are the source filenames where
              the corresponding shell function names  in  the  FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE  array
              variable are defined.  The shell function $${{FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE[[_$_i]]}} is de-
              fined  in  the   file   $${{BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE[[_$_i]]}}   and   called   from
              $${{BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE[[_$_i_+_1]]}}.
       BBAASSHH__SSUUBBSSHHEELLLL
              Incremented  by one within each subshell or subshell environment
              when the shell begins executing in that environment.   The  ini-
              tial  value  is 0.  If BBAASSHH__SSUUBBSSHHEELLLL is unset, it loses its spe-
              cial properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO
              A readonly array variable whose members hold version information
              for  this  instance  of  bbaasshh.  The values assigned to the array
              members are as follows:
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[0]]        The major version number (the _r_e_l_e_a_s_e).
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[1]]        The minor version number (the _v_e_r_s_i_o_n).
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[2]]        The patch level.
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[3]]        The build version.
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[4]]        The release status (e.g., _b_e_t_a_1).
              BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIINNFFOO[[5]]        The value of MMAACCHHTTYYPPEE.
       BBAASSHH__VVEERRSSIIOONN
              Expands to a string describing the version of this  instance  of
              bbaasshh.
       CCOOMMPP__CCWWOORRDD
              An  index  into $${{CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDSS}} of the word containing the current
              cursor position.  This variable is available only in shell func-
              tions  invoked  by  the  programmable completion facilities (see
              PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).
       CCOOMMPP__KKEEYY
              The key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the cur-
              rent completion function.
       CCOOMMPP__LLIINNEE
              The  current  command  line.  This variable is available only in
              shell functions and external commands invoked  by  the  program-
              mable completion facilities (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).
       CCOOMMPP__PPOOIINNTT
              The  index of the current cursor position relative to the begin-
              ning of the current command.  If the current cursor position  is
              at the end of the current command, the value of this variable is
              equal to $${{##CCOOMMPP__LLIINNEE}}.  This  variable  is  available  only  in
              shell  functions  and  external commands invoked by the program-
              mable completion facilities (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).
       CCOOMMPP__TTYYPPEE
              Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of  completion
              attempted  that  caused a completion function to be called: _T_A_B,
              for normal completion, _?, for listing completions after  succes-
              sive  tabs,  _!, for listing alternatives on partial word comple-
              tion, _@, to list completions if the word is not  unmodified,  or
              _%,  for  menu  completion.   This  variable is available only in
              shell functions and external commands invoked  by  the  program-
              mable completion facilities (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).
       CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDBBRREEAAKKSS
              The  set  of characters that the rreeaaddlliinnee library treats as word
              separators when performing word completion.  If  CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDBBRREEAAKKSS
              is  unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subse-
              quently reset.
       CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDSS
              An array variable (see AArrrraayyss below) consisting of the  individ-
              ual  words  in the current command line.  The line is split into
              words as rreeaaddlliinnee would split it, using CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDBBRREEAAKKSS  as  de-
              scribed  above.   This variable is available only in shell func-
              tions invoked by the  programmable  completion  facilities  (see
              PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).
       CCOOPPRROOCC An  array  variable  (see AArrrraayyss below) created to hold the file
              descriptors for output from and input to  an  unnamed  coprocess
              (see CCoopprroocceesssseess above).
       DDIIRRSSTTAACCKK
              An array variable (see AArrrraayyss below) containing the current con-
              tents of the directory stack.  Directories appear in  the  stack
              in  the order they are displayed by the ddiirrss builtin.  Assigning
              to members of this array variable may be used to modify directo-
              ries  already in the stack, but the ppuusshhdd and ppooppdd builtins must
              be used to add and remove directories.  Assignment to this vari-
              able  will not change the current directory.  If DDIIRRSSTTAACCKK is un-
              set, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently
              reset.
       EEPPOOCCHHRREEAALLTTIIMMEE
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number
              of seconds since the Unix Epoch  (see  _t_i_m_e(3))  as  a  floating
              point  value  with  micro-second  granularity.   Assignments  to
              EEPPOOCCHHRREEAALLTTIIMMEE are ignored.  If EEPPOOCCHHRREEAALLTTIIMMEE is unset, it  loses
              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       EEPPOOCCHHSSEECCOONNDDSS
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number
              of seconds since the Unix Epoch (see _t_i_m_e(3)).   Assignments  to
              EEPPOOCCHHSSEECCOONNDDSS  are  ignored.   If EEPPOOCCHHSSEECCOONNDDSS is unset, it loses
              its special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       EEUUIIDD   Expands to the effective user ID of the current  user,  initial-
              ized at shell startup.  This variable is readonly.
       FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE
              An  array  variable  containing the names of all shell functions
              currently in the execution call stack.  The element with index 0
              is the name of any currently-executing shell function.  The bot-
              tom-most element (the one with the  highest  index)  is  "main".
              This  variable  exists  only when a shell function is executing.
              Assignments to FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE have no effect.  If FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE  is  unset,
              it  loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently re-
              set.

              This variable can be  used  with  BBAASSHH__LLIINNEENNOO  and  BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE.
              Each   element   of   FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE  has  corresponding  elements  in
              BBAASSHH__LLIINNEENNOO and BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE to describe the call stack.  For in-
              stance,    $${{FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE[[_$_i]]}}    was    called    from   the   file
              $${{BBAASSHH__SSOOUURRCCEE[[_$_i_+_1]]}} at  line  number  $${{BBAASSHH__LLIINNEENNOO[[_$_i]]}}.   The
              ccaalllleerr builtin displays the current call stack using this infor-
              mation.
       GGRROOUUPPSS An array variable containing the list of  groups  of  which  the
              current user is a member.  Assignments to GGRROOUUPPSS have no effect.
              If GGRROOUUPPSS is unset, it loses its special properties, even if  it
              is subsequently reset.
       HHIISSTTCCMMDD
              The history number, or index in the history list, of the current
              command.  Assignments to HHIISSTTCCMMDD are ignored.  If HHIISSTTCCMMDD is un-
              set, it loses its special properties, even if it is subsequently
              reset.
       HHOOSSTTNNAAMMEE
              Automatically set to the name of the current host.
       HHOOSSTTTTYYPPEE
              Automatically set to a string that uniquely describes  the  type
              of  machine  on which bbaasshh is executing.  The default is system-
              dependent.
       LLIINNEENNOO Each time this parameter is referenced, the shell substitutes  a
              decimal  number  representing the current sequential line number
              (starting with 1) within a script or function.  When  not  in  a
              script  or  function, the value substituted is not guaranteed to
              be meaningful.  If LLIINNEENNOO is unset, it loses its special proper-
              ties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       MMAACCHHTTYYPPEE
              Automatically  set  to  a string that fully describes the system
              type on which bbaasshh is executing, in the  standard  GNU  _c_p_u_-_c_o_m_-
              _p_a_n_y_-_s_y_s_t_e_m format.  The default is system-dependent.
       MMAAPPFFIILLEE
              An  array  variable  (see AArrrraayyss below) created to hold the text
              read by the mmaappffiillee builtin when no variable name is supplied.
       OOLLDDPPWWDD The previous working directory as set by the ccdd command.
       OOPPTTAARRGG The value of the last option argument processed by  the  ggeettooppttss
              builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).
       OOPPTTIINNDD The  index  of  the next argument to be processed by the ggeettooppttss
              builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).
       OOSSTTYYPPEE Automatically set to a string that describes the operating  sys-
              tem  on  which  bbaasshh is executing.  The default is system-depen-
              dent.
       PPIIPPEESSTTAATTUUSS
              An array variable (see AArrrraayyss below) containing a list  of  exit
              status  values  from the processes in the most-recently-executed
              foreground pipeline (which may contain only a single command).
       PPPPIIDD   The process ID of the shell's parent.  This  variable  is  read-
              only.
       PPWWDD    The current working directory as set by the ccdd command.
       RRAANNDDOOMM Each  time  this parameter is referenced, it expands to a random
              integer between 0 and 32767.  Assigning a value to  RRAANNDDOOMM  ini-
              tializes  (seeds)  the sequence of random numbers.  If RRAANNDDOOMM is
              unset, it loses its special properties, even  if  it  is  subse-
              quently reset.
       RREEAADDLLIINNEE__AARRGGUUMMEENNTT
              Any  numeric  argument  given to a readline command that was de-
              fined using "bind -x" (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below) when it
              was invoked.
       RREEAADDLLIINNEE__LLIINNEE
              The contents of the rreeaaddlliinnee line buffer, for use with "bind -x"
              (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).
       RREEAADDLLIINNEE__MMAARRKK
              The position of the mark (saved insertion point) in the rreeaaddlliinnee
              line  buffer, for use with "bind -x" (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS
              below).  The characters between the insertion point and the mark
              are often called the _r_e_g_i_o_n.
       RREEAADDLLIINNEE__PPOOIINNTT
              The position of the insertion point in the rreeaaddlliinnee line buffer,
              for use with "bind -x" (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).
       RREEPPLLYY  Set to the line of input read by the rreeaadd builtin  command  when
              no arguments are supplied.
       SSEECCOONNDDSS
              Each time this parameter is referenced, it expands to the number
              of seconds since shell invocation.  If a value  is  assigned  to
              SSEECCOONNDDSS,  the  value  returned upon subsequent references is the
              number of seconds since the assignment plus the value  assigned.
              The  number  of seconds at shell invocation and the current time
              are always determined by querying the system clock.  If  SSEECCOONNDDSS
              is  unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is subse-
              quently reset.
       SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS
              A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each  word  in
              the  list  is  a  valid  argument  for  the --oo option to the sseett
              builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  The options
              appearing  in  SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS are those reported as _o_n by sseett --oo.  If
              this variable is in the environment when bbaasshh  starts  up,  each
              shell  option  in  the  list  will be enabled before reading any
              startup files.  This variable is read-only.
       SSHHLLVVLL  Incremented by one each time an instance of bbaasshh is started.
       SSRRAANNDDOOMM
              This variable expands to a 32-bit pseudo-random number each time
              it  is  referenced. The random number generator is not linear on
              systems that support /dev/urandom or  _a_r_c_4_r_a_n_d_o_m,  so  each  re-
              turned  number  has no relationship to the numbers preceding it.
              The random number generator cannot be seeded, so assignments  to
              this variable have no effect.  If SSRRAANNDDOOMM is unset, it loses its
              special properties, even if it is subsequently reset.
       UUIIDD    Expands to the user ID of the current user, initialized at shell
              startup.  This variable is readonly.

       The following variables are used by the shell.  In some cases, bbaasshh as-
       signs a default value to a variable; these cases are noted below.

       BBAASSHH__CCOOMMPPAATT
              The value is used to set the shell's compatibility  level.   See
              SSHHEELLLL  CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY MMOODDEE below for a description of the various
              compatibility levels and their effects.  The value may be a dec-
              imal  number  (e.g., 4.2) or an integer (e.g., 42) corresponding
              to the desired compatibility level.  If BBAASSHH__CCOOMMPPAATT is unset  or
              set  to  the empty string, the compatibility level is set to the
              default for the current version.  If BBAASSHH__CCOOMMPPAATT  is  set  to  a
              value  that  is  not  one of the valid compatibility levels, the
              shell prints an error message and sets the  compatibility  level
              to the default for the current version.  The valid values corre-
              spond to the compatibility levels described  below  under  SSHHEELLLL
              CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY  MMOODDEE.   For  example, 4.2 and 42 are valid values
              that correspond to the ccoommppaatt4422 sshhoopptt option and set the compat-
              ibility level to 42.  The current version is also a valid value.
       BBAASSHH__EENNVV
              If  this parameter is set when bbaasshh is executing a shell script,
              its value is interpreted as a filename  containing  commands  to
              initialize the shell, as in _~_/_._b_a_s_h_r_c.  The value of BBAASSHH__EENNVV is
              subjected to  parameter  expansion,  command  substitution,  and
              arithmetic  expansion  before  being  interpreted as a filename.
              PPAATTHH is not used to search for the resultant filename.
       BBAASSHH__XXTTRRAACCEEFFDD
              If set to an integer corresponding to a valid  file  descriptor,
              bbaasshh  will  write  the trace output generated when _s_e_t _-_x is en-
              abled to that file descriptor.  The file  descriptor  is  closed
              when  BBAASSHH__XXTTRRAACCEEFFDD is unset or assigned a new value.  Unsetting
              BBAASSHH__XXTTRRAACCEEFFDD or assigning it the empty string causes the  trace
              output  to  be  sent  to  the standard error.  Note that setting
              BBAASSHH__XXTTRRAACCEEFFDD to 2 (the standard error file descriptor) and then
              unsetting it will result in the standard error being closed.
       CCDDPPAATTHH The  search  path for the ccdd command.  This is a colon-separated
              list of directories in which the shell looks for destination di-
              rectories  specified  by  the  ccdd  command.   A  sample value is
              ".:~:/usr".
       CCHHIILLDD__MMAAXX
              Set the number of exited child status values for  the  shell  to
              remember.   Bash will not allow this value to be decreased below
              a POSIX-mandated minimum, and there is  a  maximum  value  (cur-
              rently  8192)  that  this  may not exceed.  The minimum value is
              system-dependent.
       CCOOLLUUMMNNSS
              Used by the sseelleecctt compound command to  determine  the  terminal
              width  when  printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the
              cchheecckkwwiinnssiizzee option is enabled or in an interactive  shell  upon
              receipt of a SSIIGGWWIINNCCHH.
       CCOOMMPPRREEPPLLYY
              An array variable from which bbaasshh reads the possible completions
              generated by a shell function invoked by the  programmable  com-
              pletion  facility (see PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn below).  Each ar-
              ray element contains one possible completion.
       EEMMAACCSS  If bbaasshh finds this variable in the environment  when  the  shell
              starts  with  value "t", it assumes that the shell is running in
              an Emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.
       EENNVV    Expanded and executed  similarly  to  BBAASSHH__EENNVV  (see  IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN
              above) when an interactive shell is invoked in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e.
       EEXXEECCIIGGNNOORREE
              A  colon-separated list of shell patterns (see PPaatttteerrnn MMaattcchhiinngg)
              defining the list of filenames to be ignored by  command  search
              using  PPAATTHH.  Files whose full pathnames match one of these pat-
              terns are not considered executable files for  the  purposes  of
              completion and command execution via PPAATTHH lookup.  This does not
              affect the behavior of the [[, tteesstt, and [[[[ commands.  Full path-
              names  in  the command hash table are not subject to EEXXEECCIIGGNNOORREE.
              Use this variable to ignore shared library files that  have  the
              executable  bit  set, but are not executable files.  The pattern
              matching honors the setting of the eexxttgglloobb shell option.
       FFCCEEDDIITT The default editor for the ffcc builtin command.
       FFIIGGNNOORREE
              A colon-separated list of suffixes  to  ignore  when  performing
              filename completion (see RREEAADDLLIINNEE below).  A filename whose suf-
              fix matches one of the entries in FFIIGGNNOORREE is excluded  from  the
              list of matched filenames.  A sample value is ".o:~".
       FFUUNNCCNNEESSTT
              If  set  to  a  numeric  value greater than 0, defines a maximum
              function nesting level.  Function invocations that  exceed  this
              nesting level will cause the current command to abort.
       GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE
              A  colon-separated  list  of  patterns  defining the set of file
              names to be ignored by  pathname  expansion.   If  a  file  name
              matched  by a pathname expansion pattern also matches one of the
              patterns in GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE, it is removed from the list of matches.
       HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL
              A colon-separated list of values controlling  how  commands  are
              saved  on  the history list.  If the list of values includes _i_g_-
              _n_o_r_e_s_p_a_c_e, lines which begin with  a  ssppaaccee  character  are  not
              saved  in  the history list.  A value of _i_g_n_o_r_e_d_u_p_s causes lines
              matching the previous history entry to not be saved.  A value of
              _i_g_n_o_r_e_b_o_t_h is shorthand for _i_g_n_o_r_e_s_p_a_c_e and _i_g_n_o_r_e_d_u_p_s.  A value
              of _e_r_a_s_e_d_u_p_s causes all previous lines matching the current line
              to  be  removed from the history list before that line is saved.
              Any value not in the above list is ignored.  If  HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL  is
              unset,  or does not include a valid value, all lines read by the
              shell parser are saved on the history list, subject to the value
              of  HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE.  The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line
              compound command are not tested, and are added  to  the  history
              regardless of the value of HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL.
       HHIISSTTFFIILLEE
              The name of the file in which command history is saved (see HHIISS--
              TTOORRYY below).  The default value is _~_/_._b_a_s_h___h_i_s_t_o_r_y.   If  unset,
              the command history is not saved when a shell exits.
       HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE
              The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When
              this variable is assigned a value, the  history  file  is  trun-
              cated,  if  necessary,  to  contain  no more than that number of
              lines by removing the oldest entries.  The history file is  also
              truncated  to this size after writing it when a shell exits.  If
              the value is 0, the history file  is  truncated  to  zero  size.
              Non-numeric  values  and  numeric  values less than zero inhibit
              truncation.  The shell sets the default value to  the  value  of
              HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE after reading any startup files.
       HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE
              A  colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command
              lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is  an-
              chored  at the beginning of the line and must match the complete
              line (no implicit `**' is  appended).   Each  pattern  is  tested
              against  the  line after the checks specified by HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL are
              applied.  In addition to the normal shell pattern matching char-
              acters,  `&&'  matches the previous history line.  `&&' may be es-
              caped using a backslash; the backslash  is  removed  before  at-
              tempting  a  match.  The second and subsequent lines of a multi-
              line compound command are not tested, and are added to the  his-
              tory  regardless of the value of HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE.  The pattern match-
              ing honors the setting of the eexxttgglloobb shell option.
       HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE
              The number of commands to remember in the command  history  (see
              HHIISSTTOORRYY  below).   If  the value is 0, commands are not saved in
              the history list.  Numeric values less than zero result in every
              command  being  saved  on  the history list (there is no limit).
              The shell sets the  default  value  to  500  after  reading  any
              startup files.
       HHIISSTTTTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT
              If  this  variable  is  set and not null, its value is used as a
              format string for _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e(3) to print the time stamp associated
              with  each  history  entry displayed by the hhiissttoorryy builtin.  If
              this variable is set, time stamps are  written  to  the  history
              file  so they may be preserved across shell sessions.  This uses
              the history comment character  to  distinguish  timestamps  from
              other history lines.
       HHOOMMEE   The home directory of the current user; the default argument for
              the ccdd builtin command.  The value of this variable is also used
              when performing tilde expansion.
       HHOOSSTTFFIILLEE
              Contains  the  name  of  a file in the same format as _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s
              that should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname.
              The  list  of possible hostname completions may be changed while
              the shell is running; the next time hostname completion  is  at-
              tempted  after  the  value is changed, bbaasshh adds the contents of
              the new file to the existing list.  If HHOOSSTTFFIILLEE is set, but  has
              no  value,  or  does  not name a readable file, bbaasshh attempts to
              read _/_e_t_c_/_h_o_s_t_s to obtain the list of possible hostname  comple-
              tions.  When HHOOSSTTFFIILLEE is unset, the hostname list is cleared.
       IIFFSS    The _I_n_t_e_r_n_a_l _F_i_e_l_d _S_e_p_a_r_a_t_o_r that is used for word splitting af-
              ter expansion and to  split  lines  into  words  with  the  rreeaadd
              builtin  command.   The  default  value  is  ``<space><tab><new-
              line>''.
       IIGGNNOORREEEEOOFF
              Controls the action of an interactive shell on receipt of an EEOOFF
              character as the sole input.  If set, the value is the number of
              consecutive EEOOFF characters which must  be  typed  as  the  first
              characters  on an input line before bbaasshh exits.  If the variable
              exists but does not have a numeric value, or has no  value,  the
              default  value  is  10.  If it does not exist, EEOOFF signifies the
              end of input to the shell.
       IINNPPUUTTRRCC
              The filename for the rreeaaddlliinnee startup file, overriding  the  de-
              fault of _~_/_._i_n_p_u_t_r_c (see RREEAADDLLIINNEE below).
       IINNSSIIDDEE__EEMMAACCSS
              If  this  variable  appears  in  the  environment when the shell
              starts, bbaasshh assumes that it is running inside  an  Emacs  shell
              buffer  and  may disable line editing, depending on the value of
              TTEERRMM.
       LLAANNGG   Used to determine the  locale  category  for  any  category  not
              specifically selected with a variable starting with LLCC__.
       LLCC__AALLLL This  variable  overrides  the  value  of LLAANNGG and any other LLCC__
              variable specifying a locale category.
       LLCC__CCOOLLLLAATTEE
              This variable determines the collation order used  when  sorting
              the  results  of pathname expansion, and determines the behavior
              of range expressions, equivalence  classes,  and  collating  se-
              quences within pathname expansion and pattern matching.
       LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE
              This  variable  determines  the interpretation of characters and
              the behavior of character classes within pathname expansion  and
              pattern matching.
       LLCC__MMEESSSSAAGGEESS
              This  variable  determines  the locale used to translate double-
              quoted strings preceded by a $$.
       LLCC__NNUUMMEERRIICC
              This variable determines the locale  category  used  for  number
              formatting.
       LLCC__TTIIMMEE
              This  variable  determines the locale category used for data and
              time formatting.
       LLIINNEESS  Used by the sseelleecctt compound  command  to  determine  the  column
              length  for  printing selection lists.  Automatically set if the
              cchheecckkwwiinnssiizzee option is enabled or in an interactive  shell  upon
              receipt of a SSIIGGWWIINNCCHH.
       MMAAIILL   If  this  parameter  is  set to a file or directory name and the
              MMAAIILLPPAATTHH variable is not set, bbaasshh informs the user of  the  ar-
              rival of mail in the specified file or Maildir-format directory.
       MMAAIILLCCHHEECCKK
              Specifies  how often (in seconds) bbaasshh checks for mail.  The de-
              fault is 60 seconds.  When it is time to  check  for  mail,  the
              shell  does  so  before  displaying the primary prompt.  If this
              variable is unset, or set to  a  value  that  is  not  a  number
              greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.
       MMAAIILLPPAATTHH
              A colon-separated list of filenames to be checked for mail.  The
              message to be printed when mail arrives in a particular file may
              be  specified by separating the filename from the message with a
              `?'.  When used in the text of the message, $$__  expands  to  the
              name of the current mailfile.  Example:
              MMAAIILLPPAATTHH='/var/mail/bfox?"You  have  mail":~/shell-mail?"$_  has
              mail!"'
              BBaasshh can be configured to supply a default value for this  vari-
              able  (there  is  no  value by default), but the location of the
              user  mail  files  that  it  uses  is  system  dependent  (e.g.,
              /var/mail/$$UUSSEERR).
       OOPPTTEERRRR If set to the value 1, bbaasshh displays error messages generated by
              the ggeettooppttss builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS  below).
              OOPPTTEERRRR  is  initialized to 1 each time the shell is invoked or a
              shell script is executed.
       PPAATTHH   The search path for commands.  It is a colon-separated  list  of
              directories  in  which the shell looks for commands (see CCOOMMMMAANNDD
              EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN below).  A zero-length (null) directory  name  in  the
              value of PPAATTHH indicates the current directory.  A null directory
              name may appear as two adjacent colons,  or  as  an  initial  or
              trailing  colon.   The  default path is system-dependent, and is
              set by the administrator who installs bbaasshh.  A common value is
              ``/usr/local/bin:/usr/lo-
              cal/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin''.
       PPOOSSIIXXLLYY__CCOORRRREECCTT
              If this variable is in the environment  when  bbaasshh  starts,  the
              shell  enters _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e before reading the startup files, as if
              the ----ppoossiixx invocation option had been supplied.  If it  is  set
              while  the  shell is running, bbaasshh enables _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, as if the
              command _s_e_t _-_o _p_o_s_i_x had been executed.  When the  shell  enters
              _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, it sets this variable if it was not already set.
       PPRROOMMPPTT__CCOOMMMMAANNDD
              If  this variable is set, and is an array, the value of each set
              element is executed as a command prior to issuing  each  primary
              prompt.   If this is set but not an array variable, its value is
              used as a command to execute instead.
       PPRROOMMPPTT__DDIIRRTTRRIIMM
              If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used  as  the
              number of trailing directory components to retain when expanding
              the \\ww and \\WW  prompt  string  escapes  (see  PPRROOMMPPTTIINNGG  below).
              Characters removed are replaced with an ellipsis.
       PPSS00    The  value  of  this parameter is expanded (see PPRROOMMPPTTIINNGG below)
              and displayed by interactive shells after reading a command  and
              before the command is executed.
       PPSS11    The  value  of  this parameter is expanded (see PPRROOMMPPTTIINNGG below)
              and used as the primary prompt string.   The  default  value  is
              ``\\ss--\\vv\\$$ ''.
       PPSS22    The  value of this parameter is expanded as with PPSS11 and used as
              the secondary prompt string.  The default is ``>> ''.
       PPSS33    The value of this parameter is used as the prompt for the sseelleecctt
              command (see SSHHEELLLL GGRRAAMMMMAARR above).
       PPSS44    The  value  of  this  parameter  is expanded as with PPSS11 and the
              value is printed before each command bbaasshh displays during an ex-
              ecution trace.  The first character of the expanded value of PPSS44
              is replicated multiple times, as necessary, to indicate multiple
              levels of indirection.  The default is ``++ ''.
       SSHHEELLLL  This  variable expands to the full pathname to the shell.  If it
              is not set when the shell starts, bbaasshh assigns to  it  the  full
              pathname of the current user's login shell.
       TTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT
              The  value of this parameter is used as a format string specify-
              ing how the timing information for pipelines prefixed  with  the
              ttiimmee  reserved word should be displayed.  The %% character intro-
              duces an escape sequence that is expanded to  a  time  value  or
              other  information.  The escape sequences and their meanings are
              as follows; the braces denote optional portions.
              %%%%        A literal %%.
              %%[[_p]][[ll]]RR  The elapsed time in seconds.
              %%[[_p]][[ll]]UU  The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.
              %%[[_p]][[ll]]SS  The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.
              %%PP        The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R.

              The optional _p is a digit specifying the _p_r_e_c_i_s_i_o_n,  the  number
              of fractional digits after a decimal point.  A value of 0 causes
              no decimal point or fraction to be output.  At most three places
              after  the  decimal  point may be specified; values of _p greater
              than 3 are changed to 3.  If _p is not specified, the value 3  is
              used.

              The  optional ll specifies a longer format, including minutes, of
              the form _M_Mm_S_S._F_Fs.  The value of _p determines  whether  or  not
              the fraction is included.

              If  this  variable  is not set, bbaasshh acts as if it had the value
              $$''\\nnrreeaall\\tt%%33llRR\\nnuusseerr\\tt%%33llUU\\nnssyyss\\tt%%33llSS''.  If the value  is  null,
              no timing information is displayed.  A trailing newline is added
              when the format string is displayed.
       TTMMOOUUTT  If set to a value greater than zero, TTMMOOUUTT is treated as the de-
              fault  timeout  for the rreeaadd builtin.  The sseelleecctt command termi-
              nates if input does not arrive after TTMMOOUUTT seconds when input is
              coming  from  a terminal.  In an interactive shell, the value is
              interpreted as the number of seconds to wait for a line of input
              after issuing the primary prompt.  BBaasshh terminates after waiting
              for that number of seconds if a complete line of input does  not
              arrive.
       TTMMPPDDIIRR If  set, bbaasshh uses its value as the name of a directory in which
              bbaasshh creates temporary files for the shell's use.
       aauuttoo__rreessuummee
              This variable controls how the shell interacts with the user and
              job  control.   If this variable is set, single word simple com-
              mands without redirections are treated as candidates for resump-
              tion of an existing stopped job.  There is no ambiguity allowed;
              if there is more than one job beginning with the  string  typed,
              the  job  most  recently  accessed  is  selected.  The _n_a_m_e of a
              stopped job, in this context, is the command line used to  start
              it.   If  set to the value _e_x_a_c_t, the string supplied must match
              the name of a stopped job exactly;  if  set  to  _s_u_b_s_t_r_i_n_g,  the
              string  supplied  needs  to  match  a substring of the name of a
              stopped job.  The _s_u_b_s_t_r_i_n_g value provides functionality  analo-
              gous  to the %%??  job identifier (see JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL below).  If set
              to any other value, the supplied string must be a  prefix  of  a
              stopped job's name; this provides functionality analogous to the
              %%_s_t_r_i_n_g job identifier.
       hhiissttcchhaarrss
              The two or three characters which control history expansion  and
              tokenization (see HHIISSTTOORRYY EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN below).  The first character
              is the _h_i_s_t_o_r_y _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n character, the character which  signals
              the  start  of  a  history  expansion, normally `!!'.  The second
              character is the _q_u_i_c_k _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n character, which is used  as
              shorthand  for  re-running the previous command entered, substi-
              tuting one string for another in the command.   The  default  is
              `^^'.   The optional third character is the character which indi-
              cates that the remainder of the line is a comment when found  as
              the  first  character of a word, normally `##'.  The history com-
              ment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the
              remaining  words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the
              shell parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

   AArrrraayyss
       BBaasshh provides one-dimensional indexed and associative array  variables.
       Any  variable may be used as an indexed array; the ddeeccllaarree builtin will
       explicitly declare an array.  There is no maximum limit on the size  of
       an  array, nor any requirement that members be indexed or assigned con-
       tiguously.  Indexed arrays are  referenced  using  integers  (including
       arithmetic expressions) and are zero-based; associative arrays are ref-
       erenced using arbitrary strings.  Unless otherwise noted, indexed array
       indices must be non-negative integers.

       An  indexed  array is created automatically if any variable is assigned
       to using the syntax _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]=_v_a_l_u_e.  The _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is treated as
       an arithmetic expression that must evaluate to a number.  To explicitly
       declare an indexed array, use ddeeccllaarree --aa _n_a_m_e (see SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMM--
       MMAANNDDSS  below).   ddeeccllaarree  --aa _n_a_m_e[[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]] is also accepted; the _s_u_b_-
       _s_c_r_i_p_t is ignored.

       Associative arrays are created using ddeeccllaarree --AA _n_a_m_e.

       Attributes may be specified for an array variable using the ddeeccllaarree and
       rreeaaddoonnllyy builtins.  Each attribute applies to all members of an array.

       Arrays   are  assigned  to  using  compound  assignments  of  the  form
       _n_a_m_e=((value_1 ... value_n)), where each _v_a_l_u_e may be  of  the  form  [_s_u_b_-
       _s_c_r_i_p_t]=_s_t_r_i_n_g.   Indexed array assignments do not require anything but
       _s_t_r_i_n_g.  Each _v_a_l_u_e in the list is expanded using all the shell  expan-
       sions  described  below under EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN.  When assigning to indexed ar-
       rays, if the optional brackets and subscript are supplied,  that  index
       is assigned to; otherwise the index of the element assigned is the last
       index assigned to by the statement plus one.  Indexing starts at zero.

       When assigning to an associative array, the words in a compound assign-
       ment  may  be  either assignment statements, for which the subscript is
       required, or a list of words that is interpreted as a sequence  of  al-
       ternating  keys and values: _n_a_m_e=(( _k_e_y_1 _v_a_l_u_e_1 _k_e_y_2 _v_a_l_u_e_2 ...)).  These
       are treated identically to  _n_a_m_e=((  [_k_e_y_1]=_v_a_l_u_e_1  [_k_e_y_2]=_v_a_l_u_e_2  ...)).
       The  first  word in the list determines how the remaining words are in-
       terpreted; all assignments in a list must be of the  same  type.   When
       using  key/value  pairs,  the keys may not be missing or empty; a final
       missing value is treated like the empty string.

       This syntax is also accepted by the ddeeccllaarree builtin.  Individual  array
       elements  may be assigned to using the _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]=_v_a_l_u_e syntax in-
       troduced above.  When assigning to an indexed array, if  _n_a_m_e  is  sub-
       scripted  by  a negative number, that number is interpreted as relative
       to one greater than the maximum index  of  _n_a_m_e,  so  negative  indices
       count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the
       last element.

       The += operator will append to an array variable when  assigning  using
       the compound assignment syntax; see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS above.

       Any  element  of  an  array may be referenced using ${_n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]}.
       The braces are required to avoid conflicts with pathname expansion.  If
       _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t  is  @@  or **, the word expands to all members of _n_a_m_e.  These
       subscripts differ only when the word appears within double quotes.   If
       the word is double-quoted, ${_n_a_m_e[*]} expands to a single word with the
       value of each array member separated by the first character of the  IIFFSS
       special variable, and ${_n_a_m_e[@]} expands each element of _n_a_m_e to a sep-
       arate word.  When there are no array  members,  ${_n_a_m_e[@]}  expands  to
       nothing.   If the double-quoted expansion occurs within a word, the ex-
       pansion of the first parameter is joined with the beginning part of the
       original  word,  and the expansion of the last parameter is joined with
       the last part of the original word.  This is analogous to the expansion
       of  the  special  parameters  **  and  @@ (see SSppeecciiaall PPaarraammeetteerrss above).
       ${#_n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]} expands to the length  of  ${_n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t]}.   If
       _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is ** or @@, the expansion is the number of elements in the ar-
       ray.  If the _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t used to reference an element of an indexed array
       evaluates  to a number less than zero, it is interpreted as relative to
       one greater than the maximum index of the array,  so  negative  indices
       count back from the end of the array, and an index of -1 references the
       last element.

       Referencing an array variable without a subscript is equivalent to ref-
       erencing  the array with a subscript of 0.  Any reference to a variable
       using a valid subscript is legal, and bbaasshh will create an array if nec-
       essary.

       An  array variable is considered set if a subscript has been assigned a
       value.  The null string is a valid value.

       It is possible to obtain the keys (indices) of an array as well as  the
       values.   ${!!_n_a_m_e[_@]} and ${!!_n_a_m_e[_*]} expand to the indices assigned in
       array variable _n_a_m_e.  The treatment when in double quotes is similar to
       the expansion of the special parameters _@ and _* within double quotes.

       The uunnsseett builtin is used to destroy arrays.  uunnsseett _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t] de-
       stroys the array element at index _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t, for both indexed and asso-
       ciative  arrays.  Negative subscripts to indexed arrays are interpreted
       as described above.  Unsetting the last element of  an  array  variable
       does  not  unset the variable.  uunnsseett _n_a_m_e, where _n_a_m_e is an array, re-
       moves the entire array.  uunnsseett _n_a_m_e[_s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t], where _s_u_b_s_c_r_i_p_t is ** or
       @@, behaves differently depending on whether _n_a_m_e is an indexed or asso-
       ciative array.  If _n_a_m_e is an associative array, this unsets  the  ele-
       ment with subscript ** or @@.  If _n_a_m_e is an indexed array, unset removes
       all of the elements but does not remove the array itself.

       When using a variable name with a subscript as an argument  to  a  com-
       mand,  such  as with uunnsseett, without using the word expansion syntax de-
       scribed above, the argument is subject to pathname expansion.  If path-
       name expansion is not desired, the argument should be quoted.

       The  ddeeccllaarree,  llooccaall,  and rreeaaddoonnllyy builtins each accept a --aa option to
       specify an indexed array and a --AA option to specify an associative  ar-
       ray.   If  both  options  are  supplied, --AA takes precedence.  The rreeaadd
       builtin accepts a --aa option to assign a list of  words  read  from  the
       standard input to an array.  The sseett and ddeeccllaarree builtins display array
       values in a way that allows them to be reused as assignments.

EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       Expansion is performed on the command line after it has been split into
       words.   There are seven kinds of expansion performed: _b_r_a_c_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n,
       _t_i_l_d_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r _a_n_d _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e  _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n,  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_-
       _t_i_o_n, _a_r_i_t_h_m_e_t_i_c _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, _w_o_r_d _s_p_l_i_t_t_i_n_g, and _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.

       The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter
       and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command  substitution
       (done  in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and pathname expan-
       sion.

       On systems that can support it, there is an additional expansion avail-
       able:  _p_r_o_c_e_s_s  _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n.   This  is  performed at the same time as
       tilde, parameter, variable, and arithmetic expansion and  command  sub-
       stitution.

       After  these  expansions are performed, quote characters present in the
       original word are removed  unless  they  have  been  quoted  themselves
       (_q_u_o_t_e _r_e_m_o_v_a_l).

       Only  brace  expansion,  word splitting, and pathname expansion can in-
       crease the number of words of the expansion; other expansions expand  a
       single  word to a single word.  The only exceptions to this are the ex-
       pansions  of  "$$@@"  and  "$${{_n_a_m_e[[@@]]}}",  and,  in  most  cases,  $$**  and
       $${{_n_a_m_e[[**]]}} as explained above (see PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS).

   BBrraaccee EExxppaannssiioonn
       _B_r_a_c_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be gener-
       ated.  This mechanism is similar to _p_a_t_h_n_a_m_e _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n, but  the  file-
       names generated need not exist.  Patterns to be brace expanded take the
       form of an optional _p_r_e_a_m_b_l_e, followed by either a series of comma-sep-
       arated  strings or a sequence expression between a pair of braces, fol-
       lowed by an optional _p_o_s_t_s_c_r_i_p_t.  The  preamble  is  prefixed  to  each
       string contained within the braces, and the postscript is then appended
       to each resulting string, expanding left to right.

       Brace expansions may be nested.  The results of  each  expanded  string
       are  not  sorted;  left  to  right  order  is  preserved.  For example,
       a{{d,c,b}}e expands into `ade ace abe'.

       A sequence expression takes the form {{_x...._y[[...._i_n_c_r]]}}, where _x and _y  are
       either  integers or single letters, and _i_n_c_r, an optional increment, is
       an integer.  When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each
       number  between  _x and _y, inclusive.  Supplied integers may be prefixed
       with _0 to force each term to have the same width.  When either _x  or  _y
       begins  with a zero, the shell attempts to force all generated terms to
       contain the same number of digits, zero-padding where necessary.   When
       letters  are supplied, the expression expands to each character lexico-
       graphically between _x and _y, inclusive, using  the  default  C  locale.
       Note  that  both  _x and _y must be of the same type (integer or letter).
       When the increment is supplied, it is used as  the  difference  between
       each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

       Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any char-
       acters special to other expansions are preserved in the result.  It  is
       strictly  textual.  BBaasshh does not apply any syntactic interpretation to
       the context of the expansion or the text between the braces.

       A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain  unquoted  opening  and
       closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid sequence ex-
       pression.  Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.  A
       {{  or  ,, may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its being considered
       part of a brace expression.  To avoid conflicts with  parameter  expan-
       sion, the string $${{ is not considered eligible for brace expansion, and
       inhibits brace expansion until the closing }}.

       This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common prefix of
       the strings to be generated is longer than in the above example:

              mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
       or
              chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}

       Brace  expansion  introduces  a  slight incompatibility with historical
       versions of sshh.  sshh does not treat opening or closing braces  specially
       when  they  appear as part of a word, and preserves them in the output.
       BBaasshh removes braces from words as a  consequence  of  brace  expansion.
       For  example,  a word entered to sshh as _f_i_l_e_{_1_,_2_} appears identically in
       the output.  The same word is output as _f_i_l_e_1 _f_i_l_e_2 after expansion  by
       bbaasshh.   If strict compatibility with sshh is desired, start bbaasshh with the
       ++BB option or disable brace expansion with the ++BB option to the sseett com-

       If  a  word  begins  with an unquoted tilde character (`~~'), all of the
       characters preceding the first unquoted slash (or  all  characters,  if
       there  is no unquoted slash) are considered a _t_i_l_d_e_-_p_r_e_f_i_x.  If none of
       the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the  characters  in  the
       tilde-prefix  following the tilde are treated as a possible _l_o_g_i_n _n_a_m_e.
       If this login name is the null string, the tilde is replaced  with  the
       value  of  the shell parameter HHOOMMEE.  If HHOOMMEE is unset, the home direc-
       tory of the user executing the shell is  substituted  instead.   Other-
       wise,  the  tilde-prefix is replaced with the home directory associated
       with the specified login name.

       If the tilde-prefix is a `~+', the value of the shell variable PPWWDD  re-
       places  the  tilde-prefix.  If the tilde-prefix is a `~-', the value of
       the shell variable OOLLDDPPWWDD, if it is set, is substituted.  If the  char-
       acters  following  the tilde in the tilde-prefix consist of a number _N,
       optionally prefixed by a `+' or a `-',  the  tilde-prefix  is  replaced
       with the corresponding element from the directory stack, as it would be
       displayed by the ddiirrss builtin invoked with the tilde-prefix as an argu-
       ment.   If  the characters following the tilde in the tilde-prefix con-
       sist of a number without a leading `+' or `-', `+' is assumed.

       If the login name is invalid, or the tilde expansion fails, the word is
       unchanged.

       Each variable assignment is checked for unquoted tilde-prefixes immedi-
       ately following a :: or the first ==.  In these cases, tilde expansion is
       also performed.  Consequently, one may use filenames with tildes in as-
       signments to PPAATTHH, MMAAIILLPPAATTHH, and CCDDPPAATTHH, and the shell assigns the  ex-
       panded value.

       Bash  also  performs tilde expansion on words satisfying the conditions
       of variable assignments (as described above under PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS) when they
       appear  as arguments to simple commands.  Bash does not do this, except
       for the _d_e_c_l_a_r_a_t_i_o_n commands listed above, when in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e.

       The `$$' character introduces parameter expansion, command substitution,
       or  arithmetic  expansion.  The parameter name or symbol to be expanded
       may be enclosed in braces, which are optional but serve to protect  the
       variable  to be expanded from characters immediately following it which
       could be interpreted as part of the name.

       When braces are used, the matching ending brace is the  first  `}}'  not
       escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and not within an em-
       bedded arithmetic expansion, command substitution, or parameter  expan-
       sion.

       ${_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r}
              The  value of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is substituted.  The braces are required
              when _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is a positional  parameter  with  more  than  one
              digit, or when _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is followed by a character which is not
              to be interpreted as part of its name.  The _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is a shell
              parameter  as  described above PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS) or an array reference
              (AArrrraayyss).

       If the first character of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an exclamation  point  (!!),  and
       _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is not a _n_a_m_e_r_e_f, it introduces a level of indirection.  BBaasshh
       uses the value formed by expanding the rest of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r as the new _p_a_-
       _r_a_m_e_t_e_r;  this  is  then expanded and that value is used in the rest of
       the expansion, rather than the expansion  of  the  original  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r.
       This is known as _i_n_d_i_r_e_c_t _e_x_p_a_n_s_i_o_n.  The value is subject to tilde ex-
       pansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic  ex-
       pansion.   If  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r  is a nameref, this expands to the name of the
       parameter referenced by _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r instead of  performing  the  complete
       indirect  expansion.   The  exceptions  to  this  are the expansions of
       ${!!_p_r_e_f_i_x**} and ${!!_n_a_m_e[_@]} described  below.   The  exclamation  point
       must  immediately  follow the left brace in order to introduce indirec-
       tion.

       In each of the cases below, _w_o_r_d is subject to tilde expansion, parame-
       ter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion.

       When not performing substring expansion, using the forms documented be-
       low (e.g., ::--), bbaasshh tests for a  parameter  that  is  unset  or  null.
       Omitting  the  colon results in a test only for a parameter that is un-
       set.

              _s_e_t.  If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is @@ or **, an indexed array subscripted by  @@
              or  **,  or  an associative array name, the results differ as de-
              scribed below.  If _l_e_n_g_t_h is omitted, expands to  the  substring
              of the value of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r starting at the character specified by
              _o_f_f_s_e_t and extending to the end of the value.  _l_e_n_g_t_h and _o_f_f_s_e_t
              are arithmetic expressions (see AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN below).

              If  _o_f_f_s_e_t  evaluates  to  a number less than zero, the value is
              used as an offset in characters from the end of the value of _p_a_-
              _r_a_m_e_t_e_r.   If _l_e_n_g_t_h evaluates to a number less than zero, it is
              interpreted as an offset in characters from the end of the value
              of  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r rather than a number of characters, and the expan-
              sion is the characters between _o_f_f_s_e_t  and  that  result.   Note
              that  a  negative  offset must be separated from the colon by at
              least one space to avoid being confused with the ::-- expansion.

              If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is @@ or **, the result is _l_e_n_g_t_h positional  parame-
              ters  beginning  at _o_f_f_s_e_t.  A negative _o_f_f_s_e_t is taken relative
              to one greater than the greatest  positional  parameter,  so  an
              offset  of -1 evaluates to the last positional parameter.  It is
              an expansion error if _l_e_n_g_t_h evaluates to  a  number  less  than
              zero.

              If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the
              result is the _l_e_n_g_t_h members of the array beginning  with  ${_p_a_-
              _r_a_m_e_t_e_r[_o_f_f_s_e_t]}.   A  negative  _o_f_f_s_e_t is taken relative to one
              greater than the maximum index of the specified array.  It is an
              expansion error if _l_e_n_g_t_h evaluates to a number less than zero.

              Substring expansion applied to an associative array produces un-
              defined results.

              Substring indexing is zero-based unless the  positional  parame-
              ters  are  used,  in  which case the indexing starts at 1 by de-
              fault.  If _o_f_f_s_e_t is 0, and the positional parameters are  used,
              $$00 is prefixed to the list.

              the list of array indices (keys) assigned in _n_a_m_e.  If  _n_a_m_e  is
              not  an  array,  expands to 0 if _n_a_m_e is set and null otherwise.
              When _@ is used and the expansion appears within  double  quotes,
              each key expands to a separate word.

              rules described under PPaatttteerrnn MMaattcchhiinngg below.  In the first form
              above, only the first match  is  replaced.   If  there  are  two
              slashes  separating  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r  and  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  (the  second  form
              above), all matches of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n are  replaced  with  _s_t_r_i_n_g.   If
              _p_a_t_t_e_r_n  is  preceded by ## (the third form above), it must match
              at the beginning of the expanded value of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r.  If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              is  preceded  by %% (the fourth form above), it must match at the
              end of the expanded value of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r.   If  the  expansion  of
              _s_t_r_i_n_g  is  null,  matches of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n are deleted.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is
              null, matches of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n are deleted and the // following _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              may be omitted.

              If  the  ppaattssuubb__rreeppllaacceemmeenntt shell option is enabled using sshhoopptt,
              any unquoted instances of && in  _s_t_r_i_n_g  are  replaced  with  the
              matching portion of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

              Quoting any part of _s_t_r_i_n_g inhibits replacement in the expansion
              of the quoted portion, including replacement strings  stored  in
              shell  variables.   Backslash will escape && in _s_t_r_i_n_g; the back-
              slash is removed in order to permit a literal && in the  replace-
              ment  string.  Backslash can also be used to escape a backslash;
              \\\\ results in a literal backslash  in  the  replacement.   Users
              should  take  care  if _s_t_r_i_n_g is double-quoted to avoid unwanted
              interactions between the  backslash  and  double-quoting,  since
              backslash  has  special  meaning  within double quotes.  Pattern
              substitution performs the check for unquoted &&  after  expanding
              _s_t_r_i_n_g; shell programmers should quote any occurrences of && they
              want to be taken literally in the replacement and ensure any in-
              stances of && they want to be replaced are unquoted.

              If  the  nnooccaasseemmaattcchh  shell option is enabled, the match is per-
              formed without regard to the case of alphabetic characters.   If
              _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r  is  @@  or **, the substitution operation is applied to
              each positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the  re-
              sultant  list.   If  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r  is an array variable subscripted
              with @@ or **, the substitution operation is applied to each  mem-
              ber  of  the  array  in turn, and the expansion is the resultant
              list.

              betic  characters in _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r.  The _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is expanded to pro-
              duce a pattern just as in pathname expansion.  Each character in
              the  expanded value of _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is tested against _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, and,
              if it matches the pattern, its case is converted.   The  pattern
              should  not attempt to match more than one character.  The ^^ op-
              erator converts lowercase letters matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n to uppercase;
              the ,, operator converts matching uppercase letters to lowercase.
              The ^^^^ and ,,,, expansions convert each matched character  in  the
              expanded  value;  the  ^^ and ,, expansions match and convert only
              the first character in the expanded value.  If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n is  omit-
              ted,  it is treated like a ??, which matches every character.  If
              _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is @@ or **, the case modification operation is  applied
              to  each  positional parameter in turn, and the expansion is the
              resultant list.  If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an array  variable  subscripted
              with  @@ or **, the case modification operation is applied to each
              member of the array in turn, and the expansion is the  resultant
              list.

                     recreate _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r with its attributes and value.

                     _e_t_e_r, except that it prints the values of indexed and as-
                     sociative  arrays as a sequence of quoted key-value pairs
                     (see AArrrraayyss above).
              aa      The expansion is a string consisting of flag values  rep-

                     ues of indexed and associative arrays to  separate  words
                     after word splitting.

              If  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r  is @@ or **, the operation is applied to each posi-
              tional parameter in turn, and the  expansion  is  the  resultant
              list.   If  _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r is an array variable subscripted with @@ or
              **, the operation is applied to each member of the array in turn,
              and the expansion is the resultant list.

              The  result  of  the  expansion is subject to word splitting and
              pathname expansion as described below.

       _C_o_m_m_a_n_d _s_u_b_s_t_i_t_u_t_i_o_n allows the output of a command to replace the com-
       mand name.  There are two forms:

              $$((_c_o_m_m_a_n_d))
       or
              ``_c_o_m_m_a_n_d``

       BBaasshh performs the expansion by executing _c_o_m_m_a_n_d in a subshell environ-
       ment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output of
       the command, with any trailing newlines deleted.  Embedded newlines are
       not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting.   The  com-
       mand  substitution  $$((ccaatt  _f_i_l_e))  can be replaced by the equivalent but
       faster $$((<< _f_i_l_e)).

       When the old-style backquote form of substitution  is  used,  backslash
       retains  its  literal  meaning except when followed by $$, ``, or \\.  The
       first backquote not preceded by a backslash terminates the command sub-
       stitution.   When using the $(_c_o_m_m_a_n_d) form, all characters between the
       parentheses make up the command; none are treated specially.

       Command substitutions may be nested.  To nest when using the backquoted
       form, escape the inner backquotes with backslashes.

       If  the  substitution  appears within double quotes, word splitting and
       pathname expansion are not performed on the results.

       Arithmetic expansion allows the evaluation of an arithmetic  expression
       and  the  substitution of the result.  The format for arithmetic expan-
       sion is:

              $$((((_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n))))

       The _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n undergoes the same expansions as if it were within  dou-
       ble  quotes,  but double quote characters in _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n are not treated
       specially and are removed.  All tokens in the expression undergo param-
       eter  and  variable expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.
       The result is treated as the arithmetic  expression  to  be  evaluated.
       Arithmetic expansions may be nested.

       The  evaluation  is performed according to the rules listed below under
       AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN.  If _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n is invalid, bbaasshh prints a message
       indicating failure and no substitution occurs.

       to using a filename.  It takes the form of  <<((_l_i_s_t))  or  >>((_l_i_s_t)).   The
       process  _l_i_s_t is run asynchronously, and its input or output appears as
       a filename.  This filename is passed as an argument to the current com-
       mand  as  the  result  of  the expansion.  If the >>((_l_i_s_t)) form is used,
       writing to the file will provide input for _l_i_s_t.  If the  <<((_l_i_s_t))  form
       is  used,  the  file passed as an argument should be read to obtain the
       output of _l_i_s_t.  Process substitution is supported on systems that sup-
       port named pipes (_F_I_F_O_s) or the //ddeevv//ffdd method of naming open files.

       When  available,  process substitution is performed simultaneously with
       parameter and variable expansion, command substitution, and  arithmetic
       expansion.

       The  shell  scans the results of parameter expansion, command substitu-
       tion, and arithmetic expansion that did not occur within double  quotes
       for _w_o_r_d _s_p_l_i_t_t_i_n_g.

       The  shell  treats each character of IIFFSS as a delimiter, and splits the
       results of the other expansions into words using  these  characters  as
       field   terminators.   If  IIFFSS  is  unset,  or  its  value  is  exactly
       <<ssppaaccee>><<ttaabb>><<nneewwlliinnee>>, the default, then sequences of  <<ssppaaccee>>,  <<ttaabb>>,
       and  <<nneewwlliinnee>>  at the beginning and end of the results of the previous
       expansions are ignored, and any sequence of IIFFSS characters not  at  the
       beginning  or  end  serves  to delimit words.  If IIFFSS has a value other
       than the default, then sequences of the  whitespace  characters  ssppaaccee,
       ttaabb,  and  nneewwlliinnee are ignored at the beginning and end of the word, as
       long as the whitespace character is in the value of IIFFSS (an IIFFSS  white-
       space  character).   Any  character  in IIFFSS that is not IIFFSS whitespace,
       along with any adjacent IIFFSS whitespace characters, delimits a field.  A
       sequence  of  IIFFSS whitespace characters is also treated as a delimiter.
       If the value of IIFFSS is null, no word splitting occurs.

       Explicit null arguments ("""" or '''') are retained and passed to  commands
       as empty strings.  Unquoted implicit null arguments, resulting from the
       expansion of parameters that have no values, are removed.  If a parame-
       ter with no value is expanded within double quotes, a null argument re-
       sults and is retained and passed to a command as an empty string.  When
       a  quoted  null  argument  appears as part of a word whose expansion is
       non-null, the null argument is removed.  That is, the word -d'' becomes
       -d after word splitting and null argument removal.

       Note that if no expansion occurs, no splitting is performed.

       After  word  splitting,  unless  the --ff option has been set, bbaasshh scans
       each word for the characters **, ??, and [[.  If one of  these  characters
       appears, and is not quoted, then the word is regarded as a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n, and
       replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of filenames  matching  the
       pattern  (see  PPaatttteerrnn  MMaattcchhiinngg  below).  If no matching filenames are
       found, and the shell option nnuullllgglloobb is not enabled, the word  is  left
       unchanged.   If  the  nnuullllgglloobb option is set, and no matches are found,
       the word is removed.  If the ffaaiillgglloobb  shell  option  is  set,  and  no
       matches  are  found, an error message is printed and the command is not
       executed.  If the shell option nnooccaasseegglloobb is enabled, the match is per-
       formed  without  regard  to  the case of alphabetic characters.  When a
       pattern is used for pathname expansion, the  character  ````..''''   at  the
       start  of  a  name or immediately following a slash must be matched ex-
       plicitly, unless the shell option ddoottgglloobb is set.  In  order  to  match
       the filenames ````..''''  and ````....'''', the pattern must begin with ``.'' (for
       example, ``.?''), even if ddoottgglloobb is set.  If  the  gglloobbsskkiippddoottss  shell
       option  is enabled, the filenames ````..''''  and ````....''''  are never matched,
       even if the pattern begins with a ````..''''.  When not matching  pathnames,
       the  ````..''''   character is not treated specially.  When matching a path-
       name, the slash character must always be matched explicitly by a  slash
       in  the  pattern, but in other matching contexts it can be matched by a
       special pattern character as described below  under  PPaatttteerrnn  MMaattcchhiinngg.

       name  that  also  matches  one of the patterns in GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE is removed
       from the list of matches.  If the nnooccaasseegglloobb option is set, the  match-
       ing  against  the patterns in GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE is performed without regard to
       case.  The filenames ````..''''  and ````....''''  are always ignored when GGLLOOBBIIGG--
       NNOORREE  is  set  and not null.  However, setting GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE to a non-null
       value has the effect of enabling the ddoottgglloobb shell option, so all other
       filenames  beginning with a ````..''''  will match.  To get the old behavior
       of ignoring filenames beginning with a ````..'''', make ````..**''''  one  of  the
       patterns in GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE.  The ddoottgglloobb option is disabled when GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE
       is unset.  The pattern matching honors the setting of the eexxttgglloobb shell
       option.

       Any character that appears in a pattern, other than the special pattern
       characters described below, matches itself.  The NUL character may  not
       occur  in  a pattern.  A backslash escapes the following character; the
       escaping backslash is discarded when  matching.   The  special  pattern
       characters must be quoted if they are to be matched literally.

       The special pattern characters have the following meanings:

              **      Matches  any string, including the null string.  When the
                     gglloobbssttaarr shell option is enabled, and  **  is  used  in  a
                     pathname  expansion  context,  two  adjacent **s used as a
                     single pattern will match all files and zero or more  di-
                     rectories  and  subdirectories.   If followed by a //, two
                     adjacent **s will match only directories  and  subdirecto-
                     ries.
              ??      Matches any single character.
              [[......]]  Matches  any  one  of the enclosed characters.  A pair of
                     characters separated by a hyphen denotes a _r_a_n_g_e  _e_x_p_r_e_s_-
                     _s_i_o_n;  any character that falls between those two charac-
                     ters, inclusive, using the current locale's collating se-
                     quence and character set, is matched.  If the first char-
                     acter following the [[ is a !!  or a ^^ then  any  character
                     not enclosed is matched.  The sorting order of characters
                     in range expressions, and the characters included in  the
                     range,  are determined by the current locale and the val-
                     ues of the LLCC__CCOOLLLLAATTEE or LLCC__AALLLL shell variables, if  set.
                     To obtain the traditional interpretation of range expres-
                     sions, where [[aa--dd]] is equivalent to [[aabbccdd]], set value  of
                     the  LLCC__AALLLL  shell variable to CC, or enable the gglloobbaassccii--
                     iirraannggeess shell option.  A -- may be matched by including it
                     as  the  first  or last character in the set.  A ]] may be
                     matched by including it as the  first  character  in  the
                     set.

                     Within  [[ and ]], _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r _c_l_a_s_s_e_s can be specified using
                     the syntax [[::_c_l_a_s_s::]], where _c_l_a_s_s is one of the following
                     classes defined in the POSIX standard:
                     aallnnuumm  aallpphhaa  aasscciiii  bbllaannkk  ccnnttrrll ddiiggiitt ggrraapphh lloowweerr pprriinntt

                     A character class matches any character belonging to that
                     class.  The wwoorrdd character class matches letters, digits,
                     and the character _.

                     Within [[ and ]], an _e_q_u_i_v_a_l_e_n_c_e _c_l_a_s_s can be specified us-
                     ing  the  syntax [[==_c==]], which matches all characters with
                     the same collation weight (as defined by the current  lo-
                     cale) as the character _c.

                     Within [[ and ]], the syntax [[.._s_y_m_b_o_l..]] matches the collat-
                     ing symbol _s_y_m_b_o_l.

       If the eexxttgglloobb shell option is enabled using  the  sshhoopptt  builtin,  the
       shell  recognizes  several extended pattern matching operators.  In the
       following description, a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t is a list of one or more patterns
       separated  by  a ||.  Composite patterns may be formed using one or more
       of the following sub-patterns:

              ??((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))
                     Matches zero or one occurrence of the given patterns
              **((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))
                     Matches zero or more occurrences of the given patterns
              ++((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))
                     Matches one or more occurrences of the given patterns
              @@((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))
                     Matches one of the given patterns
              !!((_p_a_t_t_e_r_n_-_l_i_s_t))
                     Matches anything except one of the given patterns

       Theeexxttgglloobb option changes the behavior of the parser, since the  paren-
       theses  are  normally  treated as operators with syntactic meaning.  To
       ensure that extended matching patterns are parsed correctly, make  sure
       that  eexxttgglloobb  is enabled before parsing constructs containing the pat-
       terns, including shell functions and command substitutions.

       When matching filenames, the ddoottgglloobb shell option determines the set of
       filenames  that  are  tested: when ddoottgglloobb is enabled, the set of file-
       names includes all files beginning with ``.'',  but  ``.''  and  ``..''
       must  be  matched  by  a pattern or sub-pattern that begins with a dot;
       when it is disabled, the set does not include any  filenames  beginning
       with  ``.''  unless the pattern or sub-pattern begins with a ``.''.  As
       above, ``.'' only has a special meaning when matching filenames.

       Complicated extended pattern matching against long strings is slow, es-
       pecially when the patterns contain alternations and the strings contain
       multiple matches.  Using separate matches against shorter  strings,  or
       using arrays of strings instead of a single long string, may be faster.

   QQuuoottee RReemmoovvaall
       After the preceding expansions, all unquoted occurrences of the charac-
       ters \\, '', and "" that did not result from one of the  above  expansions
       are removed.

RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN
       Before  a  command  is executed, its input and output may be _r_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_e_d
       using a special notation interpreted by the shell.  _R_e_d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n  allows
       commands'  file handles to be duplicated, opened, closed, made to refer
       to different files, and can change the files the command reads from and
       writes  to.  Redirection may also be used to modify file handles in the
       current shell execution environment.  The following redirection  opera-
       tors may precede or appear anywhere within a _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d or may fol-
       low a _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  Redirections are processed in the  order  they  appear,
       from left to right.

       Each  redirection  that may be preceded by a file descriptor number may
       instead be preceded by a word of the form {_v_a_r_n_a_m_e}.  In this case, for
       each redirection operator except >&- and <&-, the shell will allocate a
       file descriptor greater than or equal to 10 and assign it  to  _v_a_r_n_a_m_e.
       If  >&-  or  <&- is preceded by {_v_a_r_n_a_m_e}, the value of _v_a_r_n_a_m_e defines
       the file descriptor to close.  If {_v_a_r_n_a_m_e} is supplied, the  redirect-
       ion  persists  beyond the scope of the command, allowing the shell pro-
       grammer  to  manage  the  file  descriptor's  lifetime  manually.   The
       vvaarrrreeddiirr__cclloossee shell option manages this behavior.

       In  the  following descriptions, if the file descriptor number is omit-
       ted, and the first character of the redirection operator is <<, the  re-
       direction  refers  to  the  standard input (file descriptor 0).  If the
       first character of the  redirection  operator  is  >>,  the  redirection
       refers to the standard output (file descriptor 1).

       The  word  following the redirection operator in the following descrip-
       tions, unless otherwise noted, is subjected to brace  expansion,  tilde
       expansion,  parameter  and  variable  expansion,  command substitution,
       arithmetic expansion,  quote  removal,  pathname  expansion,  and  word
       splitting.  If it expands to more than one word, bbaasshh reports an error.

       Note  that  the order of redirections is significant.  For example, the
       command

              ls >> dirlist 2>>&&1

       directs both standard output and standard error to  the  file  _d_i_r_l_i_s_t,
       while the command

              ls 2>>&&1 >> dirlist

       directs  only the standard output to file _d_i_r_l_i_s_t, because the standard
       error was duplicated from the standard output before the standard  out-
       put was redirected to _d_i_r_l_i_s_t.

       BBaasshh handles several filenames specially when they are used in redirec-
       tions, as described in the following table.  If the operating system on
       which bbaasshh is running provides these special files, bash will use them;
       otherwise it will emulate them internally with the  behavior  described
       below.

              //ddeevv//ffdd//_f_d
                     If  _f_d  is  a valid integer, file descriptor _f_d is dupli-
                     cated.
              //ddeevv//ssttddiinn
                     File descriptor 0 is duplicated.
              //ddeevv//ssttddoouutt
                     File descriptor 1 is duplicated.
              //ddeevv//ssttddeerrrr
                     File descriptor 2 is duplicated.
              //ddeevv//ttccpp//_h_o_s_t//_p_o_r_t
                     If _h_o_s_t is a valid hostname or Internet address, and _p_o_r_t
                     is  an integer port number or service name, bbaasshh attempts
                     to open the corresponding TCP socket.
              //ddeevv//uuddpp//_h_o_s_t//_p_o_r_t
                     If _h_o_s_t is a valid hostname or Internet address, and _p_o_r_t
                     is  an integer port number or service name, bbaasshh attempts
                     to open the corresponding UDP socket.

       A failure to open or create a file causes the redirection to fail.

       Redirections using file descriptors greater than 9 should be used  with
       care,  as they may conflict with file descriptors the shell uses inter-
       nally.

   RReeddiirreeccttiinngg IInnppuutt
       Redirection of input causes the file whose name results from the expan-
       sion  of  _w_o_r_d  to  be  opened for reading on file descriptor _n, or the
       standard input (file descriptor 0) if _n is not specified.

       The general format for redirecting input is:

              [_n]<<_w_o_r_d

   RReeddiirreeccttiinngg OOuuttppuutt
       Redirection of output causes the file whose name results from  the  ex-
       pansion  of  _w_o_r_d to be opened for writing on file descriptor _n, or the
       standard output (file descriptor 1) if _n is not specified.  If the file
       does  not exist it is created; if it does exist it is truncated to zero
       size.

       The general format for redirecting output is:

              [_n]>>_w_o_r_d

       If the redirection operator is >>, and the nnoocclloobbbbeerr option to  the  sseett
       builtin  has  been enabled, the redirection will fail if the file whose
       name results from the expansion of _w_o_r_d exists and is a  regular  file.
       If the redirection operator is >>||, or the redirection operator is >> and
       the nnoocclloobbbbeerr option to the sseett builtin command is not enabled, the re-
       direction is attempted even if the file named by _w_o_r_d exists.

       Redirection  of  output  in this fashion causes the file whose name re-
       sults from the expansion of _w_o_r_d to be opened for appending on file de-
       scriptor  _n,  or  the  standard  output (file descriptor 1) if _n is not
       specified.  If the file does not exist it is created.

       The general format for appending output is:

              [_n]>>>>_w_o_r_d

       This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1)  and
       the  standard  error output (file descriptor 2) to be redirected to the
       file whose name is the expansion of _w_o_r_d.

       There are two formats for redirecting standard output and standard  er-
       ror:

              &&>>_w_o_r_d
       and
              >>&&_w_o_r_d

       Of the two forms, the first is preferred.  This is semantically equiva-
       lent to

              >>_w_o_r_d 2>>&&1

       When using the second form, _w_o_r_d may not expand to a number or  --.   If
       it  does,  other  redirection operators apply (see DDuupplliiccaattiinngg FFiillee DDee--
       ssccrriippttoorrss below) for compatibility reasons.

       This construct allows both the standard output (file descriptor 1)  and
       the  standard  error  output  (file descriptor 2) to be appended to the
       file whose name is the expansion of _w_o_r_d.

       The format for appending standard output and standard error is:

              &&>>>>_w_o_r_d

       This is semantically equivalent to

              >>>>_w_o_r_d 2>>&&1

       (see DDuupplliiccaattiinngg FFiillee DDeessccrriippttoorrss below).

       This type of redirection instructs the shell to  read  input  from  the
       current source until a line containing only _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r (with no trailing
       blanks) is seen.  All of the lines read up to that point are then  used
       as  the  standard  input (or file descriptor _n if _n is specified) for a
       command.

       The format of here-documents is:

              [_n]<<<<[--]_w_o_r_d
                      _h_e_r_e_-_d_o_c_u_m_e_n_t
              _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r

       No parameter and variable expansion, command  substitution,  arithmetic
       expansion,  or pathname expansion is performed on _w_o_r_d.  If any part of
       _w_o_r_d is quoted, the _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r is the result of quote removal  on  _w_o_r_d,
       and  the  lines  in the here-document are not expanded.  If _w_o_r_d is un-
       quoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to  parameter  ex-
       pansion,  command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, the character
       sequence \\<<nneewwlliinnee>> is ignored, and \\ must be used to quote the charac-
       ters \\, $$, and ``.

       If the redirection operator is <<<<--, then all leading tab characters are
       stripped from input lines and the line containing _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r.  This  al-
       lows  here-documents  within  shell scripts to be indented in a natural
       fashion.

   HHeerree SSttrriinnggss
       A variant of here documents, the format is:

              [_n]<<<<<<_w_o_r_d

       The _w_o_r_d undergoes tilde expansion, parameter and  variable  expansion,
       command  substitution,  arithmetic expansion, and quote removal.  Path-
       name expansion and word splitting are not  performed.   The  result  is
       supplied as a single string, with a newline appended, to the command on
       its standard input (or file descriptor _n if _n is specified).

       The redirection operator

              [_n]<<&&_w_o_r_d

       is used to duplicate input file descriptors.  If _w_o_r_d expands to one or
       more  digits,  the file descriptor denoted by _n is made to be a copy of
       that file descriptor.  If the digits in _w_o_r_d do not specify a file  de-
       scriptor open for input, a redirection error occurs.  If _w_o_r_d evaluates
       to --, file descriptor _n is closed.  If _n is not specified, the standard
       input (file descriptor 0) is used.

       The operator

              [_n]>>&&_w_o_r_d

       is  used  similarly  to duplicate output file descriptors.  If _n is not
       specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1)  is  used.   If  the
       digits  in _w_o_r_d do not specify a file descriptor open for output, a re-
       direction error occurs.  If _w_o_r_d evaluates to --, file descriptor  _n  is
       closed.   As  a special case, if _n is omitted, and _w_o_r_d does not expand
       to one or more digits or --, the standard output and standard error  are
       redirected as described previously.

       The redirection operator

              [_n]<<&&_d_i_g_i_t--

       moves  the  file descriptor _d_i_g_i_t to file descriptor _n, or the standard
       input (file descriptor 0) if _n is not specified.  _d_i_g_i_t is closed after
       being duplicated to _n.

       Similarly, the redirection operator

              [_n]>>&&_d_i_g_i_t--

       moves  the  file descriptor _d_i_g_i_t to file descriptor _n, or the standard
       output (file descriptor 1) if _n is not specified.

       The redirection operator

              [_n]<<>>_w_o_r_d

       causes the file whose name is the expansion of _w_o_r_d to  be  opened  for
       both  reading and writing on file descriptor _n, or on file descriptor 0
       if _n is not specified.  If the file does not exist, it is created.

AALLIIAASSEESS
       _A_l_i_a_s_e_s allow a string to be substituted for a word when it is used  as
       the  first  word  of  a  simple command.  The shell maintains a list of
       aliases that may be set and unset with the aalliiaass  and  uunnaalliiaass  builtin
       commands  (see  SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  The first word of each
       simple command, if unquoted, is checked to see if it has an alias.   If
       so,  that word is replaced by the text of the alias.  The characters //,
       $$, ``, and == and any of the shell _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s or  quoting  characters
       listed above may not appear in an alias name.  The replacement text may
       contain any valid shell input,  including  shell  metacharacters.   The
       first  word  of  the replacement text is tested for aliases, but a word
       that is identical to an alias being expanded is not expanded  a  second
       time.   This  means  that  one may alias llss to llss --FF, for instance, and
       bbaasshh does not try to recursively expand the replacement text.   If  the
       last  character  of  the  alias value is a _b_l_a_n_k, then the next command
       word following the alias is also checked for alias expansion.

       Aliases are created and listed with the aalliiaass command, and removed with
       the uunnaalliiaass command.

       There  is no mechanism for using arguments in the replacement text.  If
       arguments are needed, use a shell function (see FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS below).

       Aliases are not expanded when the shell is not interactive, unless  the
       eexxppaanndd__aalliiaasseess  shell option is set using sshhoopptt (see the description of
       sshhoopptt under SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       The rules concerning the definition and use  of  aliases  are  somewhat
       confusing.   BBaasshh always reads at least one complete line of input, and
       all lines that make up a compound command, before executing any of  the
       commands  on  that  line or the compound command.  Aliases are expanded
       when a command is read, not when it is executed.  Therefore,  an  alias
       definition  appearing on the same line as another command does not take
       effect until the next line of input is read.   The  commands  following
       the  alias  definition  on that line are not affected by the new alias.
       This behavior is also an issue when functions  are  executed.   Aliases
       are  expanded when a function definition is read, not when the function
       is executed, because a function definition is itself a command.   As  a
       consequence,  aliases defined in a function are not available until af-
       ter that function is executed.  To be safe, always  put  alias  defini-
       tions on a separate line, and do not use aalliiaass in compound commands.

       For almost every purpose, aliases are superseded by shell functions.

FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS
       A  shell  function,  defined  as  described  above under SSHHEELLLL GGRRAAMMMMAARR,
       stores a series of commands for later execution.  When the  name  of  a
       shell  function  is used as a simple command name, the list of commands
       associated with that function name is executed.  Functions are executed
       in  the  context of the current shell; no new process is created to in-
       terpret them (contrast this with the  execution  of  a  shell  script).
       When  a  function is executed, the arguments to the function become the
       positional parameters during its execution.  The special parameter ## is
       updated  to reflect the change.  Special parameter 00 is unchanged.  The
       first element of the FFUUNNCCNNAAMMEE variable is set to the name of the  func-
       tion while the function is executing.

       All  other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical be-
       tween a function and its caller with these exceptions:  the  DDEEBBUUGG  and
       RREETTUURRNN  traps  (see  the  description  of  the ttrraapp builtin under SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below) are not inherited unless the function has  been
       given  the  ttrraaccee attribute (see the description of the ddeeccllaarree builtin
       below) or the --oo ffuunnccttrraaccee shell option has been enabled with  the  sseett
       builtin  (in  which  case  all  functions  inherit the DDEEBBUUGG and RREETTUURRNN
       traps), and the EERRRR trap is not inherited unless the --oo eerrrrttrraaccee  shell
       option has been enabled.

       Variables  local to the function may be declared with the llooccaall builtin
       command (_l_o_c_a_l _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_s).  Ordinarily, variables and their values  are
       shared  between the function and its caller.  If a variable is declared
       llooccaall, the variable's visible scope is restricted to that function  and
       its children (including the functions it calls).

       In the following description, the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _s_c_o_p_e is a currently- execut-
       ing function.  Previous scopes consist of that function's caller and so
       on,  back  to  the "global" scope, where the shell is not executing any
       shell function.  Consequently, a local variable at the current scope is
       a variable declared using the llooccaall or ddeeccllaarree builtins in the function
       that is currently executing.

       Local variables "shadow" variables with the same name declared at  pre-
       vious  scopes.   For  instance, a local variable declared in a function
       hides a global variable of the same name:  references  and  assignments
       refer  to  the  local variable, leaving the global variable unmodified.
       When the function returns, the global variable is once again visible.

       The shell uses _d_y_n_a_m_i_c  _s_c_o_p_i_n_g  to  control  a  variable's  visibility
       within  functions.   With  dynamic scoping, visible variables and their
       values are a result of the sequence of function calls that caused  exe-
       cution  to  reach the current function.  The value of a variable that a
       function sees depends on its value within its caller, if  any,  whether
       that  caller  is the "global" scope or another shell function.  This is
       also the value that a local variable  declaration  "shadows",  and  the
       value that is restored when the function returns.

       For  example, if a variable _v_a_r is declared as local in function _f_u_n_c_1,
       and _f_u_n_c_1 calls another function _f_u_n_c_2, references  to  _v_a_r  made  from
       within _f_u_n_c_2 will resolve to the local variable _v_a_r from _f_u_n_c_1, shadow-
       ing any global variable named _v_a_r.

       The uunnsseett builtin also acts using the same dynamic scope: if a variable
       is local to the current scope, uunnsseett will unset it; otherwise the unset
       will refer to the variable found in  any  calling  scope  as  described
       above.   If a variable at the current local scope is unset, it will re-
       main so (appearing as unset) until it is reset in that scope  or  until
       the  function  returns.  Once the function returns, any instance of the
       variable at a previous scope will become visible.  If the unset acts on
       a  variable  at  a previous scope, any instance of a variable with that
       name that had been shadowed will become visible (see below how the  lloo--
       ccaallvvaarr__uunnsseett shell option changes this behavior).

       The  FFUUNNCCNNEESSTT  variable,  if set to a numeric value greater than 0, de-
       fines a maximum function nesting level.  Function invocations that  ex-
       ceed the limit cause the entire command to abort.

       If  the  builtin command rreettuurrnn is executed in a function, the function
       completes and execution resumes with the next command after  the  func-
       tion call.  Any command associated with the RREETTUURRNN trap is executed be-
       fore execution resumes.  When a function completes, the values  of  the
       positional  parameters  and the special parameter ## are restored to the
       values they had prior to the function's execution.

       Function names and definitions may be listed with the --ff option to  the
       ddeeccllaarree or ttyyppeesseett builtin commands.  The --FF option to ddeeccllaarree or ttyyppee--
       sseett will list the function names only (and optionally the  source  file
       and  line  number, if the eexxttddeebbuugg shell option is enabled).  Functions
       may be exported so that child shell processes (those created when  exe-
       cuting  a  separate  shell  invocation) automatically have them defined
       with the --ff option to the eexxppoorrtt builtin.  A function definition may be
       deleted using the --ff option to the uunnsseett builtin.

       Functions may be recursive.  The FFUUNNCCNNEESSTT variable may be used to limit
       the depth of the function call stack and restrict the number  of  func-
       tion invocations.  By default, no limit is imposed on the number of re-
       cursive calls.

       The shell allows arithmetic expressions to be evaluated, under  certain
       circumstances  (see  the  lleett and ddeeccllaarree builtin commands, the (((( com-
       pound command, and AArriitthhmmeettiicc EExxppaannssiioonn).  Evaluation is done in fixed-
       width  integers  with  no  check  for overflow, though division by 0 is
       trapped and flagged as an error.  The operators and  their  precedence,
       associativity,  and values are the same as in the C language.  The fol-
       lowing list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence op-
       erators.  The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence.

       Shell  variables  are  allowed as operands; parameter expansion is per-
       formed before the expression is evaluated.  Within an expression, shell
       variables  may  also  be referenced by name without using the parameter
       expansion syntax.  A shell variable that is null or unset evaluates  to
       0 when referenced by name without using the parameter expansion syntax.
       The value of a variable is evaluated as an arithmetic  expression  when
       it  is  referenced, or when a variable which has been given the _i_n_t_e_g_e_r
       attribute using ddeeccllaarree --ii is assigned a value.  A null value evaluates
       to  0.   A shell variable need not have its _i_n_t_e_g_e_r attribute turned on
       to be used in an expression.

       Integer constants follow the C language definition, without suffixes or
       character constants.  Constants with a leading 0 are interpreted as oc-
       tal numbers.  A leading 0x or 0X denotes hexadecimal.  Otherwise,  num-
       bers  take the form [_b_a_s_e_#]n, where the optional _b_a_s_e is a decimal num-
       ber between 2 and 64 representing the arithmetic base, and _n is a  num-
       ber  in  that  base.   If _b_a_s_e_# is omitted, then base 10 is used.  When
       specifying _n, if a non-digit is required, the digits greater than 9 are
       represented  by the lowercase letters, the uppercase letters, @, and _,
       in that order.  If _b_a_s_e is less than or equal to 36, lowercase and  up-
       percase  letters  may  be used interchangeably to represent numbers be-
       tween 10 and 35.

       Operators are evaluated in order  of  precedence.   Sub-expressions  in
       parentheses  are  evaluated first and may override the precedence rules
       above.

CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS
       Conditional expressions are used by the [[[[  compound  command  and  the
       tteesstt  and [[ builtin commands to test file attributes and perform string
       and arithmetic comparisons.  The tteesstt and [[  commands  determine  their
       behavior  based  on  the  number  of arguments; see the descriptions of
       those commands for any other command-specific actions.

       Expressions are formed from the following unary  or  binary  primaries.
       BBaasshh  handles several filenames specially when they are used in expres-
       sions.  If the operating system on which bbaasshh is running provides these
       special  files,  bash will use them; otherwise it will emulate them in-
       ternally with this behavior: If any _f_i_l_e argument to one  of  the  pri-
       maries is of the form _/_d_e_v_/_f_d_/_n, then file descriptor _n is checked.  If
       the _f_i_l_e argument to  one  of  the  primaries  is  one  of  _/_d_e_v_/_s_t_d_i_n,
       _/_d_e_v_/_s_t_d_o_u_t,  or _/_d_e_v_/_s_t_d_e_r_r, file descriptor 0, 1, or 2, respectively,
       is checked.

       Unless otherwise specified, primaries that operate on files follow sym-
       bolic links and operate on the target of the link, rather than the link
       itself.

       When used with [[[[, the << and >> operators sort  lexicographically  using
       the current locale.  The tteesstt command sorts using ASCII ordering.

       _a_r_g_1 OOPP _a_r_g_2

              binary  operators return true if _a_r_g_1 is equal to, not equal to,
              less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater  than
              or  equal  to _a_r_g_2, respectively.  _A_r_g_1 and _a_r_g_2 may be positive
              or negative integers.  When used with the [[[[ command,  _A_r_g_1  and
              _A_r_g_2  are  evaluated  as  arithmetic expressions (see AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC
              EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN above).

SSIIMMPPLLEE CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       When a simple command is executed, the shell performs the following ex-
       pansions,  assignments,  and  redirections,  from left to right, in the
       following order.

       1.     The words that the parser has  marked  as  variable  assignments
              (those  preceding  the  command name) and redirections are saved
              for later processing.

       2.     The words that are not variable assignments or redirections  are
              expanded.   If  any words remain after expansion, the first word
              is taken to be the name of the command and the  remaining  words
              are the arguments.

       3.     Redirections are performed as described above under RREEDDIIRREECCTTIIOONN.

       4.     The text after the == in each variable assignment undergoes tilde
              expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic
              expansion,  and quote removal before being assigned to the vari-
              able.

       If no command name results, the variable assignments affect the current
       shell  environment.   In  the case of such a command (one that consists
       only of assignment statements and redirections), assignment  statements
       are  performed before redirections.  Otherwise, the variables are added
       to the environment of the executed command and do not affect  the  cur-
       rent shell environment.  If any of the assignments attempts to assign a
       value to a readonly variable, an error occurs, and  the  command  exits
       with a non-zero status.

       If  no command name results, redirections are performed, but do not af-
       fect the current shell environment.  A  redirection  error  causes  the
       command to exit with a non-zero status.

       If  there is a command name left after expansion, execution proceeds as
       described below.  Otherwise, the command exits.  If one of  the  expan-
       sions  contained a command substitution, the exit status of the command
       is the exit status of the  last  command  substitution  performed.   If
       there were no command substitutions, the command exits with a status of
       zero.

CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN
       After a command has been split into words, if it results  in  a  simple
       command  and  an  optional list of arguments, the following actions are
       taken.

       If the command name contains no slashes, the shell attempts  to  locate
       it.   If  there  exists a shell function by that name, that function is
       invoked as described above in FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS.  If the name does not match  a
       function,  the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.  If
       a match is found, that builtin is invoked.

       If the name is neither a shell function nor a builtin, and contains  no
       slashes,  bbaasshh  searches  each element of the PPAATTHH for a directory con-
       taining an executable file by that name.  BBaasshh uses a hash table to re-
       member  the  full  pathnames  of executable files (see hhaasshh under SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  A full search of the directories in  PPAATTHH  is
       performed  only  if the command is not found in the hash table.  If the
       search is unsuccessful, the shell searches for a defined shell function
       named ccoommmmaanndd__nnoott__ffoouunndd__hhaannddllee.  If that function exists, it is invoked
       in a separate execution environment with the original command  and  the
       original  command's arguments as its arguments, and the function's exit
       status becomes the exit status of that subshell.  If that  function  is
       not defined, the shell prints an error message and returns an exit sta-
       tus of 127.

       If the search is successful, or if the command  name  contains  one  or
       more slashes, the shell executes the named program in a separate execu-
       tion environment.  Argument 0 is set to the name given, and the remain-
       ing arguments to the command are set to the arguments given, if any.

       If  this  execution fails because the file is not in executable format,
       and the file is not a directory, it is assumed to be a _s_h_e_l_l _s_c_r_i_p_t,  a
       file containing shell commands, and the shell creates a new instance of
       itself to execute it.  This subshell reinitializes itself, so that  the
       effect is as if a new shell had been invoked to handle the script, with
       the exception that the locations of commands remembered by  the  parent
       (see  hhaasshh  below  under  SSHHEELLLL  BBUUIILLTTIINN  CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS) are retained by the
       child.

       If the program is a file beginning with ##!!, the remainder of the  first
       line  specifies an interpreter for the program.  The shell executes the
       specified interpreter on operating systems that do not handle this exe-
       cutable format themselves.  The arguments to the interpreter consist of
       a single optional argument following the interpreter name on the  first
       line  of  the program, followed by the name of the program, followed by
       the command arguments, if any.

       The shell has an _e_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, which consists of  the  follow-
       ing:

       +o      open  files inherited by the shell at invocation, as modified by
              redirections supplied to the eexxeecc builtin

       +o      the current working directory as set by ccdd, ppuusshhdd, or  ppooppdd,  or
              inherited by the shell at invocation

       +o      the  file  creation  mode mask as set by uummaasskk or inherited from
              the shell's parent

       +o      current traps set by ttrraapp

       +o      shell parameters that are set by variable assignment or with sseett
              or inherited from the shell's parent in the environment

       +o      shell  functions  defined during execution or inherited from the
              shell's parent in the environment

       +o      options enabled at invocation (either by default  or  with  com-
              mand-line arguments) or by sseett

       +o      options enabled by sshhoopptt

       +o      shell aliases defined with aalliiaass

       +o      various  process  IDs,  including  those of background jobs, the
              value of $$$$, and the value of PPPPIIDD

       When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is  to  be
       executed,  it  is invoked in a separate execution environment that con-
       sists of the following.  Unless otherwise noted, the values are  inher-
       ited from the shell.


       +o      the  shell's  open  files,  plus any modifications and additions
              specified by redirections to the command

       +o      the current working directory

       +o      the file creation mode mask

       +o      shell variables and functions  marked  for  export,  along  with
              variables exported for the command, passed in the environment

       +o      traps caught by the shell are reset to the values inherited from
              the shell's parent, and traps ignored by the shell are ignored

       A command invoked  in  this  separate  environment  cannot  affect  the
       shell's execution environment.

       A _s_u_b_s_h_e_l_l is a copy of the shell process.

       Command  substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchro-
       nous commands are invoked in a subshell environment that is a duplicate
       of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell are re-
       set to the values that the shell inherited from its parent  at  invoca-
       tion.  Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also
       executed in a subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell envi-
       ronment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.

       Subshells spawned to execute command substitutions inherit the value of
       the --ee option from the parent shell.  When  not  in  _p_o_s_i_x  _m_o_d_e,  bbaasshh
       clears the --ee option in such subshells.

       If  a command is followed by a && and job control is not active, the de-
       fault standard input for the command is the empty file _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.  Oth-
       erwise,  the invoked command inherits the file descriptors of the call-
       ing shell as modified by redirections.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       When a program is invoked it is given an array of  strings  called  the
       _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t.   This  is  a  list  of  _n_a_m_e-_v_a_l_u_e  pairs,  of  the  form
       _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e.

       The shell provides several ways to manipulate the environment.  On  in-
       vocation,  the  shell scans its own environment and creates a parameter
       for each name found, automatically marking it for _e_x_p_o_r_t to child  pro-
       cesses.  Executed commands inherit the environment.  The eexxppoorrtt and ddee--
       ccllaarree --xx commands allow parameters and functions to  be  added  to  and
       deleted from the environment.  If the value of a parameter in the envi-
       ronment is modified, the new value becomes part of the environment, re-
       placing  the  old.   The  environment inherited by any executed command
       consists of the shell's initial environment, whose values may be  modi-
       fied  in  the  shell, less any pairs removed by the uunnsseett command, plus
       any additions via the eexxppoorrtt and ddeeccllaarree --xx commands.

       The environment for any _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d or  function  may  be  augmented
       temporarily  by  prefixing  it with parameter assignments, as described
       above in PPAARRAAMMEETTEERRSS.  These assignment statements affect only the envi-
       ronment seen by that command.

       If  the  --kk option is set (see the sseett builtin command below), then _a_l_l
       parameter assignments are placed in the environment for a command,  not
       just those that precede the command name.

       When  bbaasshh  invokes  an  external command, the variable __ is set to the
       full filename of the command and passed to that command in its environ-
       ment.

EEXXIITT SSTTAATTUUSS
       The  exit  status  of  an executed command is the value returned by the
       _w_a_i_t_p_i_d system call or equivalent function.  Exit statuses fall between
       0  and  255, though, as explained below, the shell may use values above
       125 specially.  Exit statuses from shell builtins and compound commands
       are also limited to this range.  Under certain circumstances, the shell
       will use special values to indicate specific failure modes.

       For the shell's purposes, a command which exits with a zero exit status
       has  succeeded.   An exit status of zero indicates success.  A non-zero
       exit status indicates failure.  When a command terminates  on  a  fatal
       signal _N, bbaasshh uses the value of 128+_N as the exit status.

       If  a command is not found, the child process created to execute it re-
       turns a status of 127.  If a command is found but  is  not  executable,
       the return status is 126.

       If a command fails because of an error during expansion or redirection,
       the exit status is greater than zero.

       Shell builtin commands return a status of 0 (_t_r_u_e) if  successful,  and
       non-zero  (_f_a_l_s_e)  if an error occurs while they execute.  All builtins
       return an exit status of 2 to indicate incorrect usage,  generally  in-
       valid options or missing arguments.

       The exit status of the last command is available in the special parame-
       ter $?.

       BBaasshh itself returns the exit status of the last command  executed,  un-
       less  a  syntax  error  occurs,  in which case it exits with a non-zero
       value.  See also the eexxiitt builtin command below.

SSIIGGNNAALLSS
       When bbaasshh is interactive, in the  absence  of  any  traps,  it  ignores
       SSIIGGTTEERRMM (so that kkiillll 00 does not kill an interactive shell), and SSIIGGIINNTT
       is caught and handled (so that the wwaaiitt builtin is interruptible).   In
       all cases, bbaasshh ignores SSIIGGQQUUIITT.  If job control is in effect, bbaasshh ig-
       nores SSIIGGTTTTIINN, SSIIGGTTTTOOUU, and SSIIGGTTSSTTPP.

       Non-builtin commands run by bbaasshh have signal handlers set to the values
       inherited by the shell from its parent.  When job control is not in ef-
       fect, asynchronous commands ignore SSIIGGIINNTT and SSIIGGQQUUIITT  in  addition  to
       these  inherited handlers.  Commands run as a result of command substi-
       tution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals SSIIGGTTTTIINN, SSIIGGTT--
       TTOOUU, and SSIIGGTTSSTTPP.

       The  shell  exits by default upon receipt of a SSIIGGHHUUPP.  Before exiting,
       an interactive shell  resends  the  SSIIGGHHUUPP  to  all  jobs,  running  or
       stopped.  Stopped jobs are sent SSIIGGCCOONNTT to ensure that they receive the
       SSIIGGHHUUPP.  To prevent the shell from sending the signal to  a  particular
       job,  it  should be removed from the jobs table with the ddiissoowwnn builtin
       (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below) or marked to not receive SSIIGGHHUUPP  us-
       ing ddiissoowwnn --hh.

       If  the  hhuuppoonneexxiitt  shell  option has been set with sshhoopptt, bbaasshh sends a
       SSIIGGHHUUPP to all jobs when an interactive login shell exits.

       If bbaasshh is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal  for
       which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until the com-
       mand completes.  When bbaasshh is waiting for an asynchronous  command  via
       the  wwaaiitt  builtin, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been
       set will cause the wwaaiitt builtin to return immediately with an exit sta-
       tus greater than 128, immediately after which the trap is executed.

       When  job  control is not enabled, and bbaasshh is waiting for a foreground
       command to complete, the shell receives keyboard-generated signals such
       as  SSIIGGIINNTT (usually generated by ^^CC) that users commonly intend to send
       to that command.  This happens because the shell and the command are in
       the same process group as the terminal, and ^^CC sends SSIIGGIINNTT to all pro-
       cesses in that process group.

       When bbaasshh is running without job control enabled  and  receives  SSIIGGIINNTT
       while  waiting for a foreground command, it waits until that foreground
       command terminates and then decides what to do about the SSIIGGIINNTT:

       1.     If the command terminates due to the SSIIGGIINNTT, bbaasshh concludes that
              the  user meant to end the entire script, and acts on the SSIIGGIINNTT
              (e.g., by running a SSIIGGIINNTT trap or exiting itself);

       2.     If the command does not terminate due  to  SSIIGGIINNTT,  the  program
              handled  the  SSIIGGIINNTT itself and did not treat it as a fatal sig-
              nal.  In that case, bbaasshh does not treat SSIIGGIINNTT as a  fatal  sig-
              nal,  either,  instead assuming that the SSIIGGIINNTT was used as part
              of the program's normal operation (e.g., emacs uses it to  abort
              editing commands) or deliberately discarded.  However, bbaasshh will
              run any trap set on SSIIGGIINNTT, as it does with  any  other  trapped
              signal  it  receives while it is waiting for the foreground com-
              mand to complete, for compatibility.

JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL
       _J_o_b _c_o_n_t_r_o_l refers to the ability to selectively stop (_s_u_s_p_e_n_d) the ex-
       ecution  of  processes and continue (_r_e_s_u_m_e) their execution at a later
       point.  A user typically employs this facility via an  interactive  in-
       terface  supplied  jointly  by  the  operating system kernel's terminal
       driver and bbaasshh.

       The shell associates a _j_o_b with each pipeline.  It  keeps  a  table  of
       currently  executing  jobs,  which may be listed with the jjoobbss command.
       When bbaasshh starts a job asynchronously (in the _b_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d), it prints  a
       line that looks like:

              [1] 25647

       indicating that this job is job number 1 and that the process ID of the
       last process in the pipeline associated with this job is 25647.  All of
       the  processes  in a single pipeline are members of the same job.  BBaasshh
       uses the _j_o_b abstraction as the basis for job control.

       To facilitate the implementation of the user interface to job  control,
       the operating system maintains the notion of a _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_l _p_r_o_c_e_s_s
       _g_r_o_u_p _I_D.  Members of this process group (processes whose process group
       ID is equal to the current terminal process group ID) receive keyboard-
       generated signals such as SSIIGGIINNTT.  These processes are said  to  be  in
       the  _f_o_r_e_g_r_o_u_n_d.  _B_a_c_k_g_r_o_u_n_d processes are those whose process group ID
       differs from the terminal's; such processes are immune to keyboard-gen-
       erated signals.  Only foreground processes are allowed to read from or,
       if the user so specifies with  stty  tostop,  write  to  the  terminal.
       Background  processes  which  attempt  to read from (write to when stty
       tostop is in effect) the terminal are sent a SSIIGGTTTTIINN  ((SSIIGGTTTTOOUU))  signal
       by  the  kernel's  terminal  driver, which, unless caught, suspends the
       process.

       If the operating system on which bbaasshh is running supports job  control,
       bbaasshh contains facilities to use it.  Typing the _s_u_s_p_e_n_d character (typ-
       ically ^^ZZ, Control-Z) while a process is running causes that process to
       be  stopped  and  returns  control to bbaasshh.  Typing the _d_e_l_a_y_e_d _s_u_s_p_e_n_d
       character (typically ^^YY, Control-Y) causes the process  to  be  stopped
       when it attempts to read input from the terminal, and control to be re-
       turned to bbaasshh.  The user may then manipulate the state  of  this  job,
       using  the  bbgg command to continue it in the background, the ffgg command
       to continue it in the foreground, or the kkiillll command to kill it.  A ^^ZZ
       takes effect immediately, and has the additional side effect of causing
       pending output and typeahead to be discarded.

       There are a number of ways to refer to a job in the shell.  The charac-
       ter  %%  introduces  a job specification (_j_o_b_s_p_e_c).  Job number _n may be
       referred to as %%nn.  A job may also be referred to using a prefix of the
       name used to start it, or using a substring that appears in its command
       line.  For example, %%ccee refers to a stopped job whose command name  be-
       gins  with  ccee.  If a prefix matches more than one job, bbaasshh reports an
       error.  Using %%??ccee, on the other hand, refers to any job containing the
       string  ccee in its command line.  If the substring matches more than one
       job, bbaasshh reports an error.  The symbols %%%% and %%++ refer to the shell's
       notion  of  the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b, which is the last job stopped while it was
       in the foreground or started in the background.  The _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s  _j_o_b  may
       be  referenced  using %%--.  If there is only a single job, %%++ and %%-- can
       both be used to refer to that job.  In output pertaining to jobs (e.g.,
       the output of the jjoobbss command), the current job is always flagged with
       a ++, and the previous job with a --.  A single % (with  no  accompanying
       job specification) also refers to the current job.

       Simply  naming a job can be used to bring it into the foreground: %%11 is
       a synonym for ````ffgg %%11'''', bringing job 1 from the  background  into  the
       foreground.   Similarly,  ````%%11  &&''''  resumes  job  1 in the background,
       equivalent to ````bbgg %%11''''.

       The shell learns immediately whenever a job changes  state.   Normally,
       bbaasshh waits until it is about to print a prompt before reporting changes
       in a job's status so as to not interrupt any other output.  If  the  --bb
       option to the sseett builtin command is enabled, bbaasshh reports such changes
       immediately.  Any trap on SSIIGGCCHHLLDD is executed for each child  that  ex-
       its.

       If  an  attempt to exit bbaasshh is made while jobs are stopped (or, if the
       cchheecckkjjoobbss shell option has been enabled using the sshhoopptt  builtin,  run-
       ning), the shell prints a warning message, and, if the cchheecckkjjoobbss option
       is enabled, lists the jobs and their statuses.  The  jjoobbss  command  may
       then  be  used to inspect their status.  If a second attempt to exit is
       made without an intervening command, the shell does not  print  another
       warning, and any stopped jobs are terminated.

       When  the shell is waiting for a job or process using the wwaaiitt builtin,
       and job control is enabled, wwaaiitt  will  return  when  the  job  changes
       state.  The --ff option causes wwaaiitt to wait until the job or process ter-
       minates before returning.

PPRROOMMPPTTIINNGG
       When executing interactively, bbaasshh displays the primary prompt PPSS11 when
       it  is  ready  to  read a command, and the secondary prompt PPSS22 when it
       needs more input to complete a command.  BBaasshh  displays  PPSS00  after  it
       reads  a  command  but  before  executing it.  BBaasshh displays PPSS44 as de-
       scribed above before tracing each command when the  --xx  option  is  en-
       abled.   BBaasshh allows these prompt strings to be customized by inserting
       a number of backslash-escaped special characters that  are  decoded  as
       follows:
              \\aa     an ASCII bell character (07)
              \\dd     the  date  in "Weekday Month Date" format (e.g., "Tue May
                     26")
              \\DD{{_f_o_r_m_a_t}}
                     the _f_o_r_m_a_t is passed to _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e(3) and the result is in-
                     serted into the prompt string; an empty _f_o_r_m_a_t results in
                     a locale-specific time representation.   The  braces  are
                     required
              \\ee     an ASCII escape character (033)
              \\hh     the hostname up to the first `.'
              \\HH     the hostname
              \\jj     the number of jobs currently managed by the shell
              \\ll     the basename of the shell's terminal device name
              \\nn     newline
              \\rr     carriage return
              \\ss     the  name  of  the shell, the basename of $$00 (the portion
                     following the final slash)
              \\tt     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
              \\TT     the current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
              \\@@     the current time in 12-hour am/pm format
              \\AA     the current time in 24-hour HH:MM format
              \\uu     the username of the current user
              \\vv     the version of bbaasshh (e.g., 2.00)
              \\VV     the release of bbaasshh, version + patch level (e.g., 2.00.0)
              \\ww     the value of the PPWWDD shell variable  ($$PPWWDD),  with  $$HHOOMMEE
                     abbreviated   with   a  tilde  (uses  the  value  of  the
                     PPRROOMMPPTT__DDIIRRTTRRIIMM variable)
              \\WW     the basename of $$PPWWDD, with $$HHOOMMEE abbreviated with a tilde
              \\!!     the history number of this command
              \\##     the command number of this command
              \\$$     if the effective UID is 0, a ##, otherwise a $$
              \\_n_n_n   the character corresponding to the octal number _n_n_n
              \\\\     a backslash
              \\[[     begin a sequence of non-printing characters, which  could
                     be  used  to  embed  a terminal control sequence into the
                     prompt
              \\]]     end a sequence of non-printing characters

       The command number and the history number are  usually  different:  the
       history  number of a command is its position in the history list, which
       may include commands restored from the history file  (see  HHIISSTTOORRYY  be-
       low),  while the command number is the position in the sequence of com-
       mands executed during the current shell session.  After the  string  is
       decoded,  it is expanded via parameter expansion, command substitution,
       arithmetic expansion, and quote removal, subject to the  value  of  the
       pprroommppttvvaarrss shell option (see the description of the sshhoopptt command under
       SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  This can have unwanted side effects  if
       escaped  portions  of  the string appear within command substitution or
       contain characters special to word expansion.

RREEAADDLLIINNEE
       This is the library that handles reading input when using  an  interac-
       tive shell, unless the ----nnooeeddiittiinngg option is given at shell invocation.
       Line editing is also used when using the --ee option to the rreeaadd builtin.
       By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of Emacs.  A
       vi-style line editing interface is also available.  Line editing can be
       enabled  at  any  time  using  the --oo eemmaaccss or --oo vvii options to the sseett
       builtin (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  To turn off  line  editing
       after  the  shell  is running, use the ++oo eemmaaccss or ++oo vvii options to the
       sseett builtin.

   RReeaaddlliinnee NNoottaattiioonn
       In this section, the Emacs-style notation is used to denote keystrokes.
       Control  keys  are  denoted by C-_k_e_y, e.g., C-n means Control-N.  Simi-
       larly, _m_e_t_a keys are denoted by M-_k_e_y, so M-x means Meta-X.   (On  key-
       boards  without a _m_e_t_a key, M-_x means ESC _x, i.e., press the Escape key
       then the _x key.  This makes ESC the _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_f_i_x.  The combination M-C-_x
       means  ESC-Control-_x, or press the Escape key then hold the Control key
       while pressing the _x key.)

       Readline commands may be given numeric _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, which normally act as
       a  repeat  count.   Sometimes,  however, it is the sign of the argument
       that is significant.  Passing a negative argument  to  a  command  that
       acts  in the forward direction (e.g., kkiillll--lliinnee) causes that command to
       act in a backward direction.  Commands whose  behavior  with  arguments
       deviates from this are noted below.

       When  a command is described as _k_i_l_l_i_n_g text, the text deleted is saved
       for possible future retrieval (_y_a_n_k_i_n_g).  The killed text is saved in a
       _k_i_l_l _r_i_n_g.  Consecutive kills cause the text to be accumulated into one
       unit, which can be yanked all at once.  Commands which do not kill text
       separate the chunks of text on the kill ring.

   RReeaaddlliinnee IInniittiiaalliizzaattiioonn
       Readline  is  customized  by putting commands in an initialization file
       (the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file).  The name of this file is taken from the  value  of
       the IINNPPUUTTRRCC variable.  If that variable is unset, the default is _~_/_._i_n_-
       _p_u_t_r_c.  If that file  does not exist or cannot be  read,  the  ultimate
       default  is  _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c.   When a program which uses the readline li-
       brary starts up, the initialization file is read, and the key  bindings
       and  variables  are set.  There are only a few basic constructs allowed
       in the readline initialization file.  Blank lines are  ignored.   Lines
       beginning  with  a  ##  are comments.  Lines beginning with a $$ indicate
       conditional constructs.  Other lines denote key bindings  and  variable
       settings.

       The  default  key-bindings  may be changed with an _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file.  Other
       programs that use this library may add their own commands and bindings.

       For example, placing

              M-Control-u: universal-argument
       or
              C-Meta-u: universal-argument
       into the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c would make M-C-u execute the readline command  _u_n_i_v_e_r_-
       _s_a_l_-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.

       The  following  symbolic  character  names are recognized: _R_U_B_O_U_T, _D_E_L,
       _E_S_C, _L_F_D, _N_E_W_L_I_N_E, _R_E_T, _R_E_T_U_R_N, _S_P_C, _S_P_A_C_E, and _T_A_B.

       In addition to command names, readline allows keys to  be  bound  to  a
       string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a _m_a_c_r_o).

   RReeaaddlliinnee KKeeyy BBiinnddiinnggss
       The  syntax for controlling key bindings in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file is simple.
       All that is required is the name of the command or the text of a  macro
       and a key sequence to which it should be bound.  The name may be speci-
       fied in one of two ways: as a symbolic key name, possibly with _M_e_t_a_- or
       _C_o_n_t_r_o_l_- prefixes, or as a key sequence.

       When using the form kkeeyynnaammee:_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e or _m_a_c_r_o, _k_e_y_n_a_m_e is the name
       of a key spelled out in English.  For example:

              Control-u: universal-argument
              Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
              Control-o: "> output"

       In the above example, _C_-_u is bound to the function  uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt,
       _M_-_D_E_L  is bound to the function bbaacckkwwaarrdd--kkiillll--wwoorrdd, and _C_-_o is bound to
       run the macro expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert  the
       text ``> output'' into the line).

       In  the  second  form,  ""kkeeyysseeqq"":_f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e or _m_a_c_r_o, kkeeyysseeqq differs
       from kkeeyynnaammee above in that strings denoting an entire key sequence  may
       be  specified  by  placing the sequence within double quotes.  Some GNU
       Emacs style key escapes can be used, as in the following  example,  but
       the symbolic character names are not recognized.

              "\C-u": universal-argument
              "\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file
              "\e[11~": "Function Key 1"

       In this example, _C_-_u is again bound to the function uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt.
       _C_-_x _C_-_r is bound to the function rree--rreeaadd--iinniitt--ffiillee, and _E_S_C _[ _1 _1 _~  is
       bound to insert the text ``Function Key 1''.

       The full set of GNU Emacs style escape sequences is
              \\CC--    control prefix
              \\MM--    meta prefix
              \\ee     an escape character
              \\\\     backslash
              \\""     literal "
              \\''     literal '

       In  addition  to  the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of
       backslash escapes is available:
              \\aa     alert (bell)
              \\bb     backspace
              \\dd     delete
              \\ff     form feed
              \\nn     newline
              \\rr     carriage return
              \\tt     horizontal tab
              \\vv     vertical tab
              \\_n_n_n   the eight-bit character whose value is  the  octal  value
                     _n_n_n (one to three digits)
              \\xx_H_H   the  eight-bit  character  whose value is the hexadecimal
                     value _H_H (one or two hex digits)

       When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must be used
       to indicate a macro definition.  Unquoted text is assumed to be a func-
       tion name.  In the macro body, the backslash  escapes  described  above
       are  expanded.   Backslash  will quote any other character in the macro
       text, including " and '.

       BBaasshh allows the current readline key bindings to be displayed or  modi-
       fied  with  the bbiinndd builtin command.  The editing mode may be switched
       during interactive use by using the --oo option to the sseett  builtin  com-
       mand (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

   RReeaaddlliinnee VVaarriiaabblleess
       Readline has variables that can be used to further customize its behav-
       ior.  A variable may be set in the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file with a statement of the
       form

              sseett _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e_-_n_a_m_e _v_a_l_u_e
       or using the bbiinndd builtin command (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).

       Except  where  noted,  readline variables can take the values OOnn or OOffff
       (without regard to case).  Unrecognized  variable  names  are  ignored.
       When  a variable value is read, empty or null values, "on" (case-insen-
       sitive), and "1" are equivalent to OOnn.  All other values are equivalent
       to OOffff.  The variables and their default values are:

       aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr
              A  string  variable  that controls the text color and background
              when displaying the text in the active region (see the  descrip-
              tion  of eennaabbllee--aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn below).  This string must not take
              up any physical character positions on the display, so it should
              consist  only of terminal escape sequences.  It is output to the
              terminal before displaying the text in the active region.   This
              variable  is  reset  to  the default value whenever the terminal
              type changes.  The default value is the  string  that  puts  the
              terminal  in standout mode, as obtained from the terminal's ter-
              minfo description.  A sample value might be "\e[01;33m".
       aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--eenndd--ccoolloorr
              A string  variable  that  "undoes"  the  effects  of  aaccttiivvee--rree--
              ggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr  and restores "normal" terminal display appear-
              ance after displaying text in the active  region.   This  string
              must  not  take  up any physical character positions on the dis-
              play, so it should consist only of  terminal  escape  sequences.
              It  is  output  to the terminal after displaying the text in the
              active region.  This variable is  reset  to  the  default  value
              whenever  the  terminal  type changes.  The default value is the
              string that restores the terminal from  standout  mode,  as  ob-
              tained from the terminal's terminfo description.  A sample value
              might be "\e[0m".
       bbeellll--ssttyyllee ((aauuddiibbllee))
              Controls what happens when readline wants to ring  the  terminal
              bell.  If set to nnoonnee, readline never rings the bell.  If set to
              vviissiibbllee, readline uses a visible bell if one is  available.   If
              set to aauuddiibbllee, readline attempts to ring the terminal's bell.
       bbiinndd--ttttyy--ssppeecciiaall--cchhaarrss ((OOnn))
              If  set  to OOnn, readline attempts to bind the control characters
              treated specially by the kernel's terminal driver to their read-
              line equivalents.
       bblliinnkk--mmaattcchhiinngg--ppaarreenn ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to an
              opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.
       ccoolloorreedd--ccoommpplleettiioonn--pprreeffiixx ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, when listing completions,  readline  displays  the
              common prefix of the set of possible completions using a differ-
              ent color.  The color definitions are taken from  the  value  of
              the LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS environment variable.  If there is a color defini-
              tion in $$LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS for the custom suffix  "readline-colored-com-
              pletion-prefix",  readline uses this color for the common prefix
              instead of its default.
       ccoolloorreedd--ssttaattss ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline displays possible completions using  dif-
              ferent  colors  to  indicate their file type.  The color defini-
              tions are taken from the  value  of  the  LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS  environment
              variable.
       ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn ((````##''''))
              The  string  that  is  inserted when the readline iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmeenntt
              command is executed.  This command is bound to MM--## in emacs mode
              and to ## in vi command mode.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--ddiissppllaayy--wwiiddtthh ((--11))
              The  number  of  screen columns used to display possible matches
              when performing completion.  The value is ignored if it is  less
              than  0 or greater than the terminal screen width.  A value of 0
              will cause matches to be displayed one per  line.   The  default
              value is -1.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--iiggnnoorree--ccaassee ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline performs filename matching and completion
              in a case-insensitive fashion.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--mmaapp--ccaassee ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, and ccoommpplleettiioonn--iiggnnoorree--ccaassee  is  enabled,  readline
              treats  hyphens  (_-) and underscores (__) as equivalent when per-
              forming case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--pprreeffiixx--ddiissppllaayy--lleennggtthh ((00))
              The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of  pos-
              sible  completions that is displayed without modification.  When
              set to a value greater than zero, common  prefixes  longer  than
              this  value are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possi-
              ble completions.
       ccoommpplleettiioonn--qquueerryy--iitteemmss ((110000))
              This determines when the user is queried about viewing the  num-
              ber  of  possible  completions generated by the ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommppllee--
              ttiioonnss command.  It may be set to any integer value greater  than
              or  equal  to  zero.   If  the number of possible completions is
              greater than or equal to the value of  this  variable,  readline
              will  ask whether or not the user wishes to view them; otherwise
              they are simply listed on the  terminal.   A  zero  value  means
              readline should never ask; negative values are treated as zero.
       ccoonnvveerrtt--mmeettaa ((OOnn))
              If  set  to OOnn, readline will convert characters with the eighth
              bit set to an ASCII key sequence by stripping the eighth bit and
              prefixing  an  escape  character (in effect, using escape as the
              _m_e_t_a _p_r_e_f_i_x).  The default is _O_n, but readline will  set  it  to
              _O_f_f  if the locale contains eight-bit characters.  This variable
              is dependent on the LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE locale category, and may change  if
              the locale is changed.
       ddiissaabbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonn ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline will inhibit word completion.  Completion
              characters will be inserted into the line as if  they  had  been
              mapped to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt.
       eecchhoo--ccoonnttrrooll--cchhaarraacctteerrss ((OOnn))
              When  set to OOnn, on operating systems that indicate they support
              it, readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal gener-
              ated from the keyboard.
       eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee ((eemmaaccss))
              Controls whether readline begins with a set of key bindings sim-
              ilar to _E_m_a_c_s or _v_i.  eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee can be set to either eemmaaccss or
              vvii.
       eemmaaccss--mmooddee--ssttrriinngg ((@@))
              If  the  _s_h_o_w_-_m_o_d_e_-_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t variable is enabled, this string is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt
              when emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded like a
              key binding, so the standard set of meta- and  control  prefixes
              and  backslash escape sequences is available.  Use the \1 and \2
              escapes to begin and end sequences of  non-printing  characters,
              which  can be used to embed a terminal control sequence into the
              mode string.
       eennaabbllee--aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn ((OOnn))
              The _p_o_i_n_t is the current cursor position, and _m_a_r_k refers  to  a
              saved  cursor  position.  The text between the point and mark is
              referred to as the _r_e_g_i_o_n.  When this variable  is  set  to  _O_n,
              readline  allows certain commands to designate the region as _a_c_-
              _t_i_v_e.  When the region is active, readline highlights  the  text
              in  the region using the value of the aaccttiivvee--rreeggiioonn--ssttaarrtt--ccoolloorr,
              which defaults to the string that enables the terminal's  stand-
              out  mode.   The active region shows the text inserted by brack-
              eted-paste and any matching text found by incremental  and  non-
              incremental history searches.
       eennaabbllee--bbrraacckkeetteedd--ppaassttee ((OOnn))
              When  set to OOnn, readline configures the terminal to insert each
              paste into the editing buffer as a single string of  characters,
              instead  of  treating each character as if it had been read from
              the keyboard.  This prevents readline from executing any editing
              commands bound to key sequences appearing in the pasted text.
       eennaabbllee--kkeeyyppaadd ((OOffff))
              When set to OOnn, readline will try to enable the application key-
              pad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the ar-
              row keys.
       eennaabbllee--mmeettaa--kkeeyy ((OOnn))
              When  set  to  OOnn, readline will try to enable any meta modifier
              key the terminal claims to support when it is called.   On  many
              terminals, the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.
       eexxppaanndd--ttiillddee ((OOffff))
              If  set  to  OOnn,  tilde expansion is performed when readline at-
              tempts word completion.
       hhiissttoorryy--pprreesseerrvvee--ppooiinntt ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, the history code attempts to place  point  at  the
              same  location on each history line retrieved with pprreevviioouuss--hhiiss--
              ttoorryy or nneexxtt--hhiissttoorryy.
       hhiissttoorryy--ssiizzee ((uunnsseett))
              Set the maximum number of history entries saved in  the  history
              list.   If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted
              and no new entries are saved.  If set to a value less than zero,
              the  number  of history entries is not limited.  By default, the
              number of history entries is set to the value  of  the  HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE
              shell  variable.  If an attempt is made to set _h_i_s_t_o_r_y_-_s_i_z_e to a
              non-numeric value, the maximum number of history entries will be
              set to 500.

              When  set  to  OOnn, makes readline use a single line for display,
              scrolling the input horizontally on a single screen line when it
              becomes  longer  than the screen width rather than wrapping to a
              new line.  This setting is automatically enabled  for  terminals
              of height 1.
       iinnppuutt--mmeettaa ((OOffff))
              If  set to OOnn, readline will enable eight-bit input (that is, it
              will not strip the eighth bit from the characters it reads), re-
              gardless  of  what the terminal claims it can support.  The name
              mmeettaa--ffllaagg is a synonym for this variable.  The default  is  _O_f_f,
              but  readline will set it to _O_n if the locale contains eight-bit
              characters.  This variable is dependent on the  LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE  locale
              category, and may change if the locale is changed.
       iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss ((````CC--[[CC--JJ''''))
              The  string  of  characters that should terminate an incremental
              search without subsequently executing the character  as  a  com-
              mand.   If this variable has not been given a value, the charac-
              ters _E_S_C and _C_-_J will terminate an incremental search.
       kkeeyymmaapp ((eemmaaccss))
              Set the current readline keymap.  The set of valid keymap  names
              is  _e_m_a_c_s_,  _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d_,  _e_m_a_c_s_-_m_e_t_a_, _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x_, _v_i_, _v_i_-_c_o_m_-
              _m_a_n_d, and _v_i_-_i_n_s_e_r_t.  _v_i is equivalent to _v_i_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d;  _e_m_a_c_s  is
              equivalent  to  _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d.  The default value is _e_m_a_c_s; the
              value of eeddiittiinngg--mmooddee also affects the default keymap.
       kkeeyysseeqq--ttiimmeeoouutt ((550000))
              Specifies the duration _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e will wait for a  character  when
              reading  an ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete
              key sequence using the input read so far, or can take additional
              input  to  complete  a longer key sequence).  If no input is re-
              ceived within the timeout, _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e will  use  the  shorter  but
              complete  key sequence.  The value is specified in milliseconds,
              so a value of 1000 means that _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e will wait one second  for
              additional  input.  If this variable is set to a value less than
              or equal to zero, or to a non-numeric value, _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e will  wait
              until  another  key  is  pressed to decide which key sequence to
              complete.

              If set to OOnn, completed names which are symbolic links to direc-
              tories have a slash appended (subject to the value  of  mmaarrkk--ddii--

       mmaattcchh--hhiiddddeenn--ffiilleess ((OOnn))
              This  variable,  when  set to OOnn, causes readline to match files
              whose names begin with a  `.'  (hidden  files)  when  performing
              filename  completion.   If  set  to OOffff, the leading `.' must be
              supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.

              If set to OOnn, menu completion displays the common prefix of  the
              list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling
              through the list.
       oouuttppuutt--mmeettaa ((OOffff))
              If set to OOnn, readline will display characters with  the  eighth
              bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence.
              The default is _O_f_f, but readline will set it to _O_n if the locale
              contains  eight-bit  characters.   This variable is dependent on
              the LLCC__CCTTYYPPEE locale category, and may change if  the  locale  is
              changed.

              If  set to OOnn, readline uses an internal _m_o_r_e-like pager to dis-
              play a screenful of possible completions at a time.

              If set to OOnn, readline will  display  completions  with  matches
              sorted  horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the
              screen.

              If set to OOnn, readline will undo all changes  to  history  lines
              before returning when aacccceepptt--lliinnee is executed.  By default, his-
              tory lines may be modified  and  retain  individual  undo  lists
              across calls to rreeaaddlliinnee.

              This  alters  the  default behavior of the completion functions.
              If set to OOnn, words which have more than one possible completion
              cause  the  matches  to be listed immediately instead of ringing
              the bell.

              This alters the default behavior of the completion functions  in
              a fashion similar to sshhooww--aallll--iiff--aammbbiigguuoouuss.  If set to OOnn, words
              which have more than one possible completion without any  possi-
              ble  partial  completion (the possible completions don't share a
              common prefix) cause the matches to be  listed  immediately  in-
              stead of ringing the bell.

              If  set to OOnn, add a string to the beginning of the prompt indi-
              cating the editing mode: emacs, vi  command,  or  vi  insertion.
              The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., _e_m_a_c_s_-_m_o_d_e_-_s_t_r_i_n_g).
       sskkiipp--ccoommpplleetteedd--tteexxtt ((OOffff))
              If  set  to OOnn, this alters the default completion behavior when
              inserting a single match into the line.  It's only  active  when
              performing  completion  in  the  middle  of a word.  If enabled,
              readline does not insert characters  from  the  completion  that
              match  characters  after  point  in the word being completed, so
              portions of the word following the cursor are not duplicated.

              If the _s_h_o_w_-_m_o_d_e_-_i_n_-_p_r_o_m_p_t variable is enabled, this  string  is
              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt
              when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.   The  value
              is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and
              control prefixes and backslash escape  sequences  is  available.
              Use  the  \1  and  \2 escapes to begin and end sequences of non-
              printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal  con-
              trol sequence into the mode string.

              displayed immediately before the last line of the primary prompt
              when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode.  The value
              is expanded like a key binding, so the standard set of meta- and

              _s_t_a_t(2)  is  appended to the filename when listing possible com-
              pletions.

   RReeaaddlliinnee CCoonnddiittiioonnaall CCoonnssttrruuccttss
       Readline implements a facility similar in  spirit  to  the  conditional
       compilation  features  of  the C preprocessor which allows key bindings
       and variable settings to be performed as the result  of  tests.   There
       are four parser directives used.

       $$iiff    The  $$iiff construct allows bindings to be made based on the edit-
              ing mode, the terminal being  used,  or  the  application  using
              readline.  The text of the test, after any comparison operator,
               extends  to  the  end  of  the line; unless otherwise noted, no
              characters are required to isolate it.

              mmooddee   The mmooddee== form of the  $$iiff  directive  is  used  to  test
                     whether  readline  is  in  emacs or vi mode.  This may be
                     used in conjunction with the sseett kkeeyymmaapp command, for  in-
                     stance,   to  set  bindings  in  the  _e_m_a_c_s_-_s_t_a_n_d_a_r_d  and
                     _e_m_a_c_s_-_c_t_l_x keymaps only if readline is  starting  out  in
                     emacs mode.

              tteerrmm   The  tteerrmm==  form may be used to include terminal-specific
                     key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by
                     the terminal's function keys.  The word on the right side
                     of the == is tested against both the full name of the ter-
                     minal  and  the  portion  of the terminal name before the
                     first --.  This allows _s_u_n to match both _s_u_n and  _s_u_n_-_c_m_d,
                     for instance.

              vveerrssiioonn
                     The  vveerrssiioonn  test  may  be  used  to perform comparisons
                     against specific readline versions.  The vveerrssiioonn  expands
                     to  the  current readline version.  The set of comparison
                     operators includes ==, (and ====), !!==, <<==,  >>==,  <<,  and  >>.
                     The  version number supplied on the right side of the op-
                     erator consists of a major version  number,  an  optional
                     decimal point, and an optional minor version (e.g., 77..11).
                     If the minor version is omitted, it is assumed to  be  00.
                     The operator may be separated from the string vveerrssiioonn and
                     from the version number argument by whitespace.

              aapppplliiccaattiioonn
                     The aapppplliiccaattiioonn construct is used to include application-
                     specific  settings.   Each program using the readline li-
                     brary sets the _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _n_a_m_e,  and  an  initialization
                     file can test for a particular value.  This could be used
                     to bind key sequences to functions useful for a  specific
                     program.   For instance, the following command adds a key
                     sequence that quotes the  current  or  previous  word  in
                     bbaasshh:

                     $$iiff Bash
                     # Quote the current or previous word
                     "\C-xq": "\eb\"\ef\""
                     $$eennddiiff

              _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e
                     The _v_a_r_i_a_b_l_e construct provides simple equality tests for
                     readline variables and values.  The permitted  comparison
                     operators  are  _=, _=_=, and _!_=.  The variable name must be
                     separated from the comparison operator by whitespace; the
                     operator  may  be  separated  from the value on the right
                     hand side by whitespace.  Both string and  boolean  vari-
                     ables  may  be  tested.  Boolean variables must be tested
                     against the values _o_n and _o_f_f.

       $$eennddiiff This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an $$iiff
              command.

       $$eellssee  Commands in this branch of the $$iiff directive are executed if the
              test fails.

       $$iinncclluuddee
              This directive takes a single filename as an argument and  reads
              commands  and bindings from that file.  For example, the follow-
              ing directive would read _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c:

              $$iinncclluuddee  _/_e_t_c_/_i_n_p_u_t_r_c

   SSeeaarrcchhiinngg
       Readline provides commands for searching through  the  command  history
       (see HHIISSTTOORRYY below) for lines containing a specified string.  There are
       two search modes: _i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l and _n_o_n_-_i_n_c_r_e_m_e_n_t_a_l.

       Incremental searches begin before the  user  has  finished  typing  the
       search  string.  As each character of the search string is typed, read-
       line displays the next entry from the history matching the string typed
       so  far.   An  incremental  search  requires only as many characters as
       needed to find the desired history entry.  The  characters  present  in
       the  value of the iisseeaarrcchh--tteerrmmiinnaattoorrss variable are used to terminate an
       incremental search.  If that variable has not been assigned a value the
       Escape  and  Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search.
       Control-G will abort an incremental search  and  restore  the  original
       line.   When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the
       search string becomes the current line.

       To find other matching entries in the history list, type  Control-S  or
       Control-R  as appropriate.  This will search backward or forward in the
       history for the next entry matching the search  string  typed  so  far.
       Any  other  key sequence bound to a readline command will terminate the
       search and execute that command.  For instance, a _n_e_w_l_i_n_e  will  termi-
       nate the search and accept the line, thereby executing the command from
       the history list.

       Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two Control-
       Rs  are  typed without any intervening characters defining a new search
       string, any remembered search string is used.

       Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before  starting
       to  search  for matching history lines.  The search string may be typed
       by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

       The following is a list of the names of the commands  and  the  default
       key sequences to which they are bound.  Command names without an accom-
       panying key sequence are unbound by default.  In the following descrip-
       tions,  _p_o_i_n_t refers to the current cursor position, and _m_a_r_k refers to
       a cursor position saved by the sseett--mmaarrkk command.  The text between  the

       yyaannkk--nntthh--aarrgg ((MM--CC--yy))
              Insert  the  first argument to the previous command (usually the
              second word on the previous line) at point.  With an argument _n,
              insert  the _nth word from the previous command (the words in the
              previous command begin with word 0).  A  negative  argument  in-
              serts  the  _nth word from the end of the previous command.  Once
              the argument _n is computed, the argument is extracted as if  the
              "!_n" history expansion had been specified.
       yyaannkk--llaasstt--aarrgg ((MM--..,, MM--__))
              Insert  the last argument to the previous command (the last word
              of the previous history entry).  With a numeric argument, behave
              exactly  like  yyaannkk--nntthh--aarrgg.   Successive calls to yyaannkk--llaasstt--aarrgg
              move back through the history list, inserting the last word  (or
              the  word  specified  by the argument to the first call) of each
              line in turn.  Any numeric argument supplied to these successive
              calls  determines  the direction to move through the history.  A
              negative argument switches the  direction  through  the  history
              (back or forward).  The history expansion facilities are used to
              extract the last word, as if the "!$" history expansion had been
              specified.

              The  character  indicating  end-of-file  as set, for example, by
              ``stty''.  If this character is read when there are  no  charac-
              ters  on  the  line,  and point is at the beginning of the line,
              readline interprets it as the end of input and returns EEOOFF.
       ddeelleettee--cchhaarr ((CC--dd))
              Delete the character at point.  If this function is bound to the
              same character as the tty EEOOFF character, as CC--dd commonly is, see

              Delete  the  character under the cursor, unless the cursor is at
              the end of the line, in which case the character behind the cur-
              sor is deleted.

       ttrraannssppoossee--cchhaarrss ((CC--tt))
              Drag the character before point forward over  the  character  at
              point,  moving point forward as well.  If point is at the end of
              the line, then this transposes the two characters before  point.
              Negative arguments have no effect.
       ttrraannssppoossee--wwoorrddss ((MM--tt))
              Drag  the  word  before  point past the word after point, moving
              point over that word as well.  If point is at  the  end  of  the
              line, this transposes the last two words on the line.
       uuppccaassee--wwoorrdd ((MM--uu))
              Uppercase  the current (or following) word.  With a negative ar-
              gument, uppercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       ddoowwnnccaassee--wwoorrdd ((MM--ll))
              Lowercase the current (or following) word.  With a negative  ar-
              gument, lowercase the previous word, but do not move point.
       ccaappiittaalliizzee--wwoorrdd ((MM--cc))
              Capitalize the current (or following) word.  With a negative ar-
              gument, capitalize the previous word, but do not move point.
       oovveerrwwrriittee--mmooddee
              Toggle overwrite mode.  With an explicit positive numeric  argu-
              ment, switches to overwrite mode.  With an explicit non-positive
              numeric argument, switches to insert mode.  This command affects
              only  eemmaaccss mode; vvii mode does overwrite differently.  Each call
              to _r_e_a_d_l_i_n_e_(_) starts in insert mode.  In overwrite mode, charac-
              ters  bound to sseellff--iinnsseerrtt replace the text at point rather than
              pushing the text  to  the  right.   Characters  bound  to  bbaacckk--
              wwaarrdd--ddeelleettee--cchhaarr  replace  the  character  before  point  with a

       uunniixx--wwoorrdd--rruubboouutt ((CC--ww))
              Kill the word behind point, using white space as a  word  bound-
              ary.  The killed text is saved on the kill-ring.
       uunniixx--ffiilleennaammee--rruubboouutt
              Kill  the  word  behind  point,  using white space and the slash
              character as the word boundaries.  The killed text is  saved  on
              the kill-ring.

              Delete all spaces and tabs around point.
       kkiillll--rreeggiioonn
              Kill the text in the current region.
       ccooppyy--rreeggiioonn--aass--kkiillll
              Copy the text in the region to the kill buffer.
       ccooppyy--bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd
              Copy  the word before point to the kill buffer.  The word bound-
              aries are the same as bbaacckkwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       ccooppyy--ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd
              Copy the word following point to  the  kill  buffer.   The  word
              boundaries are the same as ffoorrwwaarrdd--wwoorrdd.
       yyaannkk ((CC--yy))
              Yank the top of the kill ring into the buffer at point.
       yyaannkk--ppoopp ((MM--yy))
              Rotate  the kill ring, and yank the new top.  Only works follow-
              ing yyaannkk or yyaannkk--ppoopp.

   NNuummeerriicc AArrgguummeennttss
       ddiiggiitt--aarrgguummeenntt ((MM--00,, MM--11,, ......,, MM----))
              Add this digit to the argument already accumulating, or start  a
              new argument.  M-- starts a negative argument.
       uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt
              This  is another way to specify an argument.  If this command is
              followed by one or more digits, optionally with a leading  minus
              sign,  those digits define the argument.  If the command is fol-
              lowed by digits, executing uunniivveerrssaall--aarrgguummeenntt again ends the nu-
              meric argument, but is otherwise ignored.  As a special case, if
              this command is immediately followed by a character that is nei-
              ther  a  digit  nor  minus sign, the argument count for the next
              command is multiplied by four.  The argument count is  initially
              one,  so  executing this function the first time makes the argu-
              ment count four, a second time makes the argument count sixteen,
              and so on.

   CCoommpplleettiinngg
       ccoommpplleettee ((TTAABB))
              Attempt  to  perform  completion on the text before point.  BBaasshh
              attempts completion treating the text as a variable (if the text
              begins  with  $$), username (if the text begins with ~~), hostname
              (if the text begins with @@), or command (including  aliases  and
              functions) in turn.  If none of these produces a match, filename
              completion is attempted.
       ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((MM--??))
              List the possible completions of the text before point.
       iinnsseerrtt--ccoommpplleettiioonnss ((MM--**))
              Insert all completions of the text before point that would  have
              been generated by ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss.
       mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee
              Similar  to ccoommpplleettee, but replaces the word to be completed with
              a single match from the list of possible completions.   Repeated
              execution  of  mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee  steps through the list of possible
              completions, inserting each match in turn.  At the  end  of  the
              list of completions, the bell is rung (subject to the setting of
              bbeellll--ssttyyllee) and the original text is restored.  An argument of _n
              moves _n positions forward in the list of matches; a negative ar-
              gument may be used to move backward through the list.  This com-
              mand is intended to be bound to TTAABB, but is unbound by default.
       mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee--bbaacckkwwaarrdd
              Identical  to mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee, but moves backward through the list
              of possible completions, as if mmeennuu--ccoommpplleettee had  been  given  a
              negative argument.  This command is unbound by default.
       ddeelleettee--cchhaarr--oorr--lliisstt
              Deletes  the  character under the cursor if not at the beginning
              or end of the line (like ddeelleettee--cchhaarr).  If at  the  end  of  the
              line, behaves identically to ppoossssiibbllee--ccoommpplleettiioonnss.  This command
              is unbound by default.

       ccoommpplleettee--ccoommmmaanndd ((MM--!!))
              Attempt  completion  on  the text before point, treating it as a

              against   aliases,   reserved   words,  shell  functions,  shell
              builtins, and finally executable filenames, in that order.

              Re-execute  the last keyboard macro defined, by making the char-
              acters in the macro appear as if typed at the keyboard.
       pprriinntt--llaasstt--kkbbdd--mmaaccrroo (())
              Print the last keyboard macro defined in a format  suitable  for

              Read  in  the  contents of the _i_n_p_u_t_r_c file, and incorporate any
              bindings or variable assignments found there.
       aabboorrtt ((CC--gg))
              Abort the current editing command and ring the  terminal's  bell
              (subject to the setting of bbeellll--ssttyyllee).

              If  the  metafied character _x is uppercase, run the command that
              is bound to the corresponding metafied lowercase character.  The
              behavior is undefined if _x is already lowercase.
       pprreeffiixx--mmeettaa ((EESSCC))
              Metafy the next character typed.  EESSCC ff is equivalent to MMeettaa--ff.
       uunnddoo ((CC--__,, CC--xx CC--uu))

       rreevveerrtt--lliinnee ((MM--rr))
              Undo  all changes made to this line.  This is like executing the
              uunnddoo command enough times to return  the  line  to  its  initial
              state.
       ttiillddee--eexxppaanndd ((MM--&&))

       sseett--mmaarrkk ((CC--@@,, MM--<<ssppaaccee>>))
              Set  the  mark to the point.  If a numeric argument is supplied,
              the mark is set to that position.

              Swap the point with the mark.  The current  cursor  position  is
              set  to the saved position, and the old cursor position is saved
              as the mark.
       cchhaarraacctteerr--sseeaarrcchh ((CC--]]))
              A character is read and point is moved to the next occurrence of
              that  character.   A negative argument searches for previous oc-
              currences.

              A character is read and point is moved to  the  previous  occur-
              rence  of that character.  A negative argument searches for sub-
              sequent occurrences.
       sskkiipp--ccssii--sseeqquueennccee
              Read enough characters to consume a multi-key sequence  such  as
              those  defined for keys like Home and End.  Such sequences begin
              with a Control Sequence Indicator (CSI), usually ESC-[.  If this
              sequence  is  bound  to "\[", keys producing such sequences will
              have no effect unless explicitly bound to  a  readline  command,
              instead  of  inserting stray characters into the editing buffer.
              This is unbound by default, but usually bound to ESC-[.
       iinnsseerrtt--ccoommmmeenntt ((MM--##))
              Without a numeric argument,  the  value  of  the  readline  ccoomm--
              mmeenntt--bbeeggiinn  variable is inserted at the beginning of the current
              line.  If a numeric argument is supplied, this command acts as a
              toggle:  if  the  characters at the beginning of the line do not
              match the value of ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn, the value is inserted,  other-
              wise the characters in ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn are deleted from the begin-
              ning of the line.  In either case, the line is accepted as if  a
              newline  had  been  typed.   The  default value of ccoommmmeenntt--bbeeggiinn
              causes this command to make the current line  a  shell  comment.
              If  a  numeric  argument  causes the comment character to be re-
              moved, the line will be executed by the shell.

              Perform spelling correction on the current word, treating it  as
              a  directory  or  filename, in the same way as the ccddssppeellll shell

              The  word  before point is treated as a pattern for pathname ex-
              pansion, with an asterisk implicitly appended.  This pattern  is
              used  to generate a list of matching filenames for possible com-
              pletions.
       gglloobb--eexxppaanndd--wwoorrdd ((CC--xx **))
              The word before point is treated as a pattern for  pathname  ex-
              pansion, and the list of matching filenames is inserted, replac-
              ing the word.  If a numeric argument is supplied, an asterisk is
              appended before pathname expansion.

              The  list  of  expansions  that  would  have  been  generated by
              gglloobb--eexxppaanndd--wwoorrdd is displayed, and the line is  redrawn.   If  a

   PPrrooggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn
       When  word  completion  is  attempted  for an argument to a command for
       which a completion specification (a _c_o_m_p_s_p_e_c) has  been  defined  using
       the  ccoommpplleettee  builtin (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below), the program-
       mable completion facilities are invoked.

       First, the command name is identified.  If  the  command  word  is  the
       empty  string (completion attempted at the beginning of an empty line),
       any compspec defined with the --EE option to  ccoommpplleettee  is  used.   If  a
       compspec  has  been  defined  for that command, the compspec is used to
       generate the list of possible completions for the word.  If the command
       word  is  a full pathname, a compspec for the full pathname is searched
       for first.  If no compspec is found for the full pathname,  an  attempt
       is  made  to find a compspec for the portion following the final slash.
       If those searches do not result in a  compspec,  any  compspec  defined
       with  the --DD option to ccoommpplleettee is used as the default.  If there is no
       default compspec, bbaasshh attempts alias expansion on the command word  as
       a  final  resort,  and attempts to find a compspec for the command word
       from any successful expansion.

       Once a compspec has been found, it is used  to  generate  the  list  of
       matching  words.   If a compspec is not found, the default bbaasshh comple-
       tion as described above under CCoommpplleettiinngg is performed.

       First, the actions specified by the compspec are  used.   Only  matches
       which  are prefixed by the word being completed are returned.  When the
       --ff or --dd option is used for filename or directory name completion,  the
       shell variable FFIIGGNNOORREE is used to filter the matches.

       Any completions specified by a pathname expansion pattern to the --GG op-
       tion are generated next.  The words generated by the pattern  need  not
       match  the  word being completed.  The GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE shell variable is not
       used to filter the matches, but the FFIIGGNNOORREE variable is used.

       Next, the string specified as the argument to the --WW option is  consid-
       ered.   The  string is first split using the characters in the IIFFSS spe-
       cial variable as delimiters.  Shell quoting is honored.  Each  word  is
       then  expanded  using  brace  expansion, tilde expansion, parameter and
       variable expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion,  as
       described above under EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN.  The results are split using the rules
       described above under WWoorrdd SSpplliittttiinngg.  The results of the expansion are
       prefix-matched against the word being completed, and the matching words
       become the possible completions.

       After these matches have been generated, any shell function or  command
       specified  with  the --FF and --CC options is invoked.  When the command or
       function is invoked, the CCOOMMPP__LLIINNEE, CCOOMMPP__PPOOIINNTT, CCOOMMPP__KKEEYY, and CCOOMMPP__TTYYPPEE
       variables are assigned values as described above under SShheellll VVaarriiaabblleess.
       If a shell function is being invoked,  the  CCOOMMPP__WWOORRDDSS  and  CCOOMMPP__CCWWOORRDD
       variables  are  also set.  When the function or command is invoked, the
       first argument ($$11) is the name of the command whose arguments are  be-
       ing  completed,  the  second argument ($$22) is the word being completed,
       and the third argument ($$33) is the word preceding the word  being  com-
       pleted on the current command line.  No filtering of the generated com-
       pletions against the word being completed is performed; the function or
       command has complete freedom in generating the matches.

       Any  function specified with --FF is invoked first.  The function may use
       any of the shell facilities, including the  ccoommppggeenn  builtin  described
       below,  to  generate the matches.  It must put the possible completions
       in the CCOOMMPPRREEPPLLYY array variable, one per array element.

       Next, any command specified with the --CC option is invoked in  an  envi-
       ronment  equivalent to command substitution.  It should print a list of
       completions, one per line, to the standard output.   Backslash  may  be
       used to escape a newline, if necessary.

       After  all of the possible completions are generated, any filter speci-
       fied with the --XX option is applied to the list.  The filter is  a  pat-
       tern  as  used  for  pathname expansion; a && in the pattern is replaced
       with the text of the word being completed.  A literal && may be  escaped
       with  a  backslash; the backslash is removed before attempting a match.
       Any completion that matches the pattern will be removed from the  list.
       A leading !! negates the pattern; in this case any completion not match-
       ing the pattern will be removed.  If the nnooccaasseemmaattcchh  shell  option  is
       enabled,  the  match  is performed without regard to the case of alpha-
       betic characters.

       Finally, any prefix and suffix specified with the --PP and --SS options are
       added to each member of the completion list, and the result is returned
       to the readline completion code as the list of possible completions.

       If the previously-applied actions do not generate any matches, and  the
       --oo  ddiirrnnaammeess  option was supplied to ccoommpplleettee when the compspec was de-
       fined, directory name completion is attempted.

       If the --oo pplluussddiirrss option was supplied to ccoommpplleettee  when  the  compspec
       was defined, directory name completion is attempted and any matches are
       added to the results of the other actions.

       By default, if a compspec is found, whatever it generates  is  returned
       to  the  completion  code as the full set of possible completions.  The
       default bbaasshh completions are not attempted, and the readline default of
       filename completion is disabled.  If the --oo bbaasshhddeeffaauulltt option was sup-
       plied to ccoommpplleettee when the compspec was defined, the bbaasshh default  com-
       pletions are attempted if the compspec generates no matches.  If the --oo
       ddeeffaauulltt option was supplied to ccoommpplleettee when the compspec was  defined,
       readline's  default  completion will be performed if the compspec (and,
       if attempted, the default bbaasshh completions) generate no matches.

       When a compspec indicates that directory name  completion  is  desired,
       the  programmable completion functions force readline to append a slash
       to completed names which are symbolic links to directories, subject  to
       the  value of the mmaarrkk--ddiirreeccttoorriieess readline variable, regardless of the
       setting of the mmaarrkk--ssyymmlliinnkkeedd--ddiirreeccttoorriieess readline variable.

       There is some support for dynamically modifying completions.   This  is
       most  useful  when used in combination with a default completion speci-
       fied with ccoommpplleettee --DD.  It's possible for shell functions  executed  as
       completion  handlers  to  indicate that completion should be retried by
       returning an exit status of 124.  If a shell function returns 124,  and
       changes the compspec associated with the command on which completion is
       being attempted (supplied as the first argument when  the  function  is
       executed), programmable completion restarts from the beginning, with an
       attempt to find a new compspec for that command.  This allows a set  of
       completions  to be built dynamically as completion is attempted, rather
       than being loaded all at once.

       For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each  kept
       in  a  file corresponding to the name of the command, the following de-
       fault completion function would load completions dynamically:

       _completion_loader()
       {
            . "/etc/bash_completion.d/$1.sh" >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124
       }
       complete -D -F _completion_loader -o bashdefault -o default


HHIISSTTOORRYY
       When the --oo hhiissttoorryy option to the sseett builtin  is  enabled,  the  shell
       provides access to the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d _h_i_s_t_o_r_y, the list of commands previously
       typed.  The value of the HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE variable is used  as  the  number  of
       commands to save in a history list.  The text of the last HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE com-
       mands (default 500) is saved.  The shell stores  each  command  in  the
       history  list  prior to parameter and variable expansion (see EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       above) but after history expansion is performed, subject to the  values
       of the shell variables HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE and HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL.

       On startup, the history is initialized from the file named by the vari-
       able HHIISSTTFFIILLEE (default _~_/_._b_a_s_h___h_i_s_t_o_r_y).  The file named by  the  value
       of  HHIISSTTFFIILLEE  is  truncated,  if necessary, to contain no more than the
       number of lines specified by the value of HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE.   If  HHIISSTTFFIILLEE--
       SSIIZZEE  is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value
       less than zero, the history file is not truncated.   When  the  history
       file  is  read, lines beginning with the history comment character fol-
       lowed immediately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the fol-
       lowing history line.  These timestamps are optionally displayed depend-
       ing on the value of the HHIISSTTTTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT variable.   When  a  shell  with
       history  enabled  exits,  the  last $$HHIISSTTSSIIZZEE lines are copied from the
       history list to $$HHIISSTTFFIILLEE.  If the hhiissttaappppeenndd shell option  is  enabled
       (see  the description of sshhoopptt under SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below), the
       lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history  file  is
       overwritten.   If  HHIISSTTFFIILLEE  is  unset,  or  if the history file is un-
       writable, the history is not saved.  If the HHIISSTTTTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT variable  is
       set,  time stamps are written to the history file, marked with the his-
       tory comment character, so they may be preserved across shell sessions.
       This  uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from
       other history lines.  After saving the history,  the  history  file  is
       truncated  to contain no more than HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE lines.  If HHIISSTTFFIILLEESSIIZZEE
       is unset, or set to null, a non-numeric value, or a numeric value  less
       than zero, the history file is not truncated.

       The  builtin  command ffcc (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below) may be used
       to list or edit and re-execute a portion of the history list.  The hhiiss--
       ttoorryy  builtin may be used to display or modify the history list and ma-
       nipulate the history file.  When  using  command-line  editing,  search
       commands  are available in each editing mode that provide access to the
       history list.

       The shell allows control over which commands are saved on  the  history
       list.  The HHIISSTTCCOONNTTRROOLL and HHIISSTTIIGGNNOORREE variables may be set to cause the
       shell to save only a subset of the commands entered.  The ccmmddhhiisstt shell
       option,  if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each line of a
       multi-line command in the same history entry, adding  semicolons  where
       necessary  to preserve syntactic correctness.  The lliitthhiisstt shell option
       causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines instead  of
       semicolons.  See the description of the sshhoopptt builtin below under SSHHEELLLL
       BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS for information on setting  and  unsetting  shell  op-
       tions.

HHIISSTTOORRYY EEXXPPAANNSSIIOONN
       The  shell  supports a history expansion feature that is similar to the
       history expansion in ccsshh.  This section describes what syntax  features
       are  available.   This  feature  is  enabled by default for interactive
       shells, and can be disabled using the ++HH option to the sseett builtin com-
       mand (see SSHHEELLLL BBUUIILLTTIINN CCOOMMMMAANNDDSS below).  Non-interactive shells do not
       perform history expansion by default.

       History expansions introduce words from the history list into the input
       stream,  making  it  easy to repeat commands, insert the arguments to a
       previous command into the current input line, or fix errors in previous
       commands quickly.

       History  expansion  is  performed  immediately after a complete line is
       read, before the shell breaks it into words, and is performed  on  each
       line  individually  without  taking  quoting on previous lines into ac-
       count.  It takes place in two parts.  The first is to  determine  which
       line  from  the history list to use during substitution.  The second is
       to select portions of that line for inclusion  into  the  current  one.
       The  line  selected  from the history is the _e_v_e_n_t, and the portions of
       that line that are acted upon are _w_o_r_d_s.  Various _m_o_d_i_f_i_e_r_s are  avail-
       able  to  manipulate the selected words.  The line is broken into words
       in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several  _m_e_t_a_c_h_a_r_a_c_-
       _t_e_r-separated words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  His-
       tory expansions are introduced by the appearance of the history  expan-
       sion  character,  which is !! by default.  Only backslash (\\) and single
       quotes can quote the history expansion character, but the  history  ex-
       pansion  character is also treated as quoted if it immediately precedes
       the closing double quote in a double-quoted string.

       Several characters inhibit history expansion if found immediately  fol-
       lowing  the history expansion character, even if it is unquoted: space,
       tab, newline, carriage return, and ==.  If the eexxttgglloobb shell  option  is
       enabled, (( will also inhibit expansion.

       Several  shell  options  settable with the sshhoopptt builtin may be used to
       tailor the behavior of history expansion.  If the hhiissttvveerriiffyy shell  op-
       tion  is  enabled (see the description of the sshhoopptt builtin below), and
       rreeaaddlliinnee is being  used,  history  substitutions  are  not  immediately
       passed  to  the  shell  parser.  Instead, the expanded line is reloaded
       into the rreeaaddlliinnee editing buffer for further modification.  If rreeaaddlliinnee
       is  being  used,  and  the hhiissttrreeeeddiitt shell option is enabled, a failed
       history substitution will be reloaded into the rreeaaddlliinnee editing  buffer
       for  correction.   The  --pp option to the hhiissttoorryy builtin command may be
       used to see what a history expansion will do before using it.   The  --ss
       option to the hhiissttoorryy builtin may be used to add commands to the end of
       the history list without actually executing  them,  so  that  they  are
       available for subsequent recall.

       The  shell allows control of the various characters used by the history
       expansion mechanism (see the description of hhiissttcchhaarrss above under SShheellll
       VVaarriiaabblleess).   The shell uses the history comment character to mark his-
       tory timestamps when writing the history file.

       An event designator is a reference to a command line entry in the  his-

       Word  designators are used to select desired words from the event.  A ::
       separates the event specification from the word designator.  It may  be
       omitted  if  the word designator begins with a ^^, $$, **, --, or %%.  Words
       are numbered from the beginning of the line, with the first word  being
       denoted  by  0  (zero).  Words are inserted into the current line sepa-
       rated by single spaces.

       00 ((zzeerroo))
              The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
       _n      The _nth word.
       ^^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
       $$      The last word.  This is usually the last argument, but will  ex-
              pand to the zeroth word if there is only one word in the line.
       %%      The  first word matched by the most recent `?_s_t_r_i_n_g?' search, if
              the search string begins with a character  that  is  part  of  a
              word.
       _x--_y    A range of words; `-_y' abbreviates `0-_y'.
       **      All  of  the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `_1_-_$'.
              It is not an error to use ** if there is just  one  word  in  the
              event; the empty string is returned in that case.
       xx**     Abbreviates _x_-_$.
       xx--     Abbreviates _x_-_$ like xx**, but omits the last word.  If xx is miss-
              ing, it defaults to 0.

       If a word designator is supplied without an  event  specification,  the
       previous command is used as the event.

   MMooddiiffiieerrss
       After  the optional word designator, there may appear a sequence of one
       or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `:'.  These mod-
       ify, or edit, the word or words selected from the history event.

       hh      Remove a trailing filename component, leaving only the head.
       tt      Remove all leading filename components, leaving the tail.
       rr      Remove a trailing suffix of the form _._x_x_x, leaving the basename.
       ee      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
       pp      Print the new command but do not execute it.
       qq      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
       xx      Quote  the  substituted words as with qq, but break into words at
              bbllaannkkss and newlines.  The qq and xx modifiers are mutually  exclu-
              sive; the last one supplied is used.
       ss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//
              Substitute  _n_e_w  for  the  first  occurrence of _o_l_d in the event
              line.  Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of /.
              The  final  delimiter is optional if it is the last character of
              the event line.  The delimiter may be quoted in _o_l_d and _n_e_w with
              a single backslash.  If & appears in _n_e_w, it is replaced by _o_l_d.
              A single backslash will quote the &.  If _o_l_d is null, it is  set
              to  the last _o_l_d substituted, or, if no previous history substi-
              tutions took place, the last _s_t_r_i_n_g in  a  !!??_s_t_r_i_n_g[[??]]   search.
              If _n_e_w is null, each matching _o_l_d is deleted.
       &&      Repeat the previous substitution.
       gg      Cause changes to be applied over the entire event line.  This is
              used in conjunction with `::ss' (e.g.,  `::ggss//_o_l_d//_n_e_w//')  or  `::&&'.
              If  used with `::ss', any delimiter can be used in place of /, and
              the final delimiter is optional if it is the last  character  of
              the event line.  An aa may be used as a synonym for gg.
       GG      Apply the following `ss' or `&&' modifier once to each word in the
              event line.

       Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section
       as accepting options preceded by -- accepts ---- to signify the end of the
       options.  The ::, ttrruuee, ffaallssee, and tteesstt/[[ builtins do not accept options
       and  do  not treat ---- specially.  The eexxiitt, llooggoouutt, rreettuurrnn, bbrreeaakk, ccoonn--
       ttiinnuuee, lleett, and sshhiifftt builtins accept and process  arguments  beginning
       with  -- without requiring ----.  Other builtins that accept arguments but
       are not specified as accepting options  interpret  arguments  beginning
       with  --  as  invalid options and require ---- to prevent this interpreta-
       tion.
       :: [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]
              No effect; the command does nothing beyond  expanding  _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s
              and performing any specified redirections.  The return status is
              zero.

              Read and execute commands from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e in the current shell en-
              vironment  and  return  the exit status of the last command exe-
              cuted from _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  does  not  contain  a  slash,
              filenames  in  PPAATTHH  are  used  to find the directory containing
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, but _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e does not need to be executable.  The file
              searched  for  in PPAATTHH need not be executable.  When bbaasshh is not
              in _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, it searches the current directory if no  file  is
              found  in  PPAATTHH.   If the ssoouurrcceeppaatthh option to the sshhoopptt builtin
              command is turned off, the PPAATTHH is not searched.  If  any  _a_r_g_u_-
              _m_e_n_t_s  are  supplied, they become the positional parameters when
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is executed.  Otherwise the positional  parameters  are
              unchanged.   If the --TT option is enabled, .. inherits any trap on
              DDEEBBUUGG; if it is not, any DDEEBBUUGG trap string is saved and restored
              around  the call to .., and .. unsets the DDEEBBUUGG trap while it exe-
              cutes.  If --TT is not set, and the sourced file changes the DDEEBBUUGG
              trap,  the  new  value is retained when .. completes.  The return
              status is the status of  the  last  command  exited  within  the
              script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is
              not found or cannot be read.

       aalliiaass [--pp] [_n_a_m_e[=_v_a_l_u_e] ...]
              AAlliiaass with no arguments or with the --pp option prints the list of
              aliases  in  the form aalliiaass _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e on standard output.  When
              arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each _n_a_m_e  whose
              _v_a_l_u_e  is given.  A trailing space in _v_a_l_u_e causes the next word
              to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.
              For  each  _n_a_m_e  in the argument list for which no _v_a_l_u_e is sup-
              plied, the name and value of the alias is  printed.   AAlliiaass  re-
              turns  true  unless  a _n_a_m_e is given for which no alias has been
              defined.

       bbgg [_j_o_b_s_p_e_c ...]
              Resume each suspended job _j_o_b_s_p_e_c in the background,  as  if  it
              had been started with &&.  If _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is not present, the shell's
              notion of the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b is used.  bbgg _j_o_b_s_p_e_c returns 0  unless
              run  when  job control is disabled or, when run with job control
              enabled, any specified _j_o_b_s_p_e_c was  not  found  or  was  started
              without job control.

              each  binding  or command must be passed as a separate argument;

              Execute  the  specified shell builtin, passing it _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s, and
              return its exit status.  This is useful when defining a function
              whose  name  is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the func-
              tionality of the builtin within the function.  The ccdd builtin is
              commonly  redefined  this  way.   The  return status is false if

              tion or a script executed with the .. or ssoouurrccee builtins).  With-
              out _e_x_p_r, ccaalllleerr displays the line number and source filename of
              the  current subroutine call.  If a non-negative integer is sup-
              plied as _e_x_p_r, ccaalllleerr displays the line number, subroutine name,
              and  source  file  corresponding to that position in the current
              execution call stack.  This extra information may be  used,  for
              example,  to print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.
              The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing  a  sub-
              routine  call or _e_x_p_r does not correspond to a valid position in
              the call stack.

       ccdd [--LL|[--PP [--ee]] [-@]] [_d_i_r]
              Change the current directory to _d_i_r.  if _d_i_r  is  not  supplied,
              the  value of the HHOOMMEE shell variable is the default.  The vari-
              able CCDDPPAATTHH defines the search path for the directory containing
              _d_i_r:  each directory name in CCDDPPAATTHH is searched for _d_i_r.  Alter-
              native directory names in CCDDPPAATTHH are separated by a  colon  (:).
              A  null  directory name in CCDDPPAATTHH is the same as the current di-
              rectory, i.e., ``..''.  If _d_i_r begins with a slash (/), then  CCDD--
              PPAATTHH  is  not used.  The --PP option causes ccdd to use the physical
              directory structure by resolving symbolic links while traversing
              _d_i_r  and  before processing instances of _._. in _d_i_r (see also the
              --PP option to the sseett builtin command); the --LL option forces sym-
              bolic  links to be followed by resolving the link after process-
              ing instances of _._. in _d_i_r.  If _._. appears in _d_i_r,  it  is  pro-
              cessed  by  removing the immediately previous pathname component
              from _d_i_r, back to a slash or the beginning of _d_i_r.   If  the  --ee
              option  is  supplied  with --PP, and the current working directory
              cannot be successfully determined after a  successful  directory
              change,  ccdd will return an unsuccessful status.  On systems that
              support it, the --@@ option presents the extended attributes asso-
              ciated  with  a  file  as a directory.  An argument of -- is con-
              verted to $$OOLLDDPPWWDD before the directory change is attempted.   If
              a  non-empty  directory name from CCDDPPAATTHH is used, or if -- is the
              first argument, and the directory change is successful, the  ab-
              solute  pathname  of the new working directory is written to the
              standard output.  If the directory change is successful, ccdd sets
              the  value  of the PPWWDD environment variable to the new directory
              name, and sets the OOLLDDPPWWDD environment variable to the  value  of
              the  current  working  directory  before the change.  The return
              value is true if the directory was successfully  changed;  false
              otherwise.

       ccoommmmaanndd [--ppVVvv] _c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g ...]
              Run  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  with  _a_r_g_s  suppressing  the normal shell function
              lookup.  Only builtin commands or commands found in the PPAATTHH are
              executed.   If the --pp option is given, the search for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is
              performed using a default value for PPAATTHH that is  guaranteed  to
              find  all of the standard utilities.  If either the --VV or --vv op-
              tion is supplied, a description of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is printed.   The  --vv
              option  causes  a single word indicating the command or filename
              used to invoke _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be displayed; the --VV option produces a
              more  verbose  description.  If the --VV or --vv option is supplied,
              the exit status is 0 if _c_o_m_m_a_n_d was found, and  1  if  not.   If
              neither option is supplied and an error occurred or _c_o_m_m_a_n_d can-
              not be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit  sta-
              tus of the ccoommmmaanndd builtin is the exit status of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.

       ccoommppggeenn [_o_p_t_i_o_n] [_w_o_r_d]
              Generate  possible  completion matches for _w_o_r_d according to the
              _o_p_t_i_o_ns, which may  be  any  option  accepted  by  the  ccoommpplleettee
              builtin  with  the exception of --pp and --rr, and write the matches
              to the standard output.  When using the --FF or  --CC  options,  the
              various  shell  variables set by the programmable completion fa-
              cilities, while available, will not have useful values.

              The matches will be generated in the same way as if the program-
              mable completion code had generated them directly from a comple-
              tion specification with the same flags.  If _w_o_r_d  is  specified,
              only those completions matching _w_o_r_d will be displayed.

              The  return  value is true unless an invalid option is supplied,
              or no matches were generated.

       ccoommpplleettee --pprr [--DDEEII] [_n_a_m_e ...]
              Specify how arguments to each _n_a_m_e should be completed.  If  the
              --pp  option  is supplied, or if no options are supplied, existing
              completion specifications are printed in a way that allows  them
              to be reused as input.  The --rr option removes a completion spec-
              ification for each _n_a_m_e, or, if no _n_a_m_es are supplied, all  com-
              pletion specifications.  The --DD option indicates that other sup-
              plied options and actions should apply to the  ``default''  com-
              mand  completion; that is, completion attempted on a command for
              which no completion has previously been defined.  The --EE  option
              indicates  that  other supplied options and actions should apply
              to ``empty'' command completion; that is,  completion  attempted
              on  a  blank  line.  The --II option indicates that other supplied
              options and actions should apply to completion  on  the  initial
              non-assignment  word  on  the line, or after a command delimiter
              such as ;; or ||, which is usually command  name  completion.   If
              multiple  options  are  supplied, the --DD option takes precedence
              over --EE, and both take precedence over --II.  If any of --DD, --EE, or
              --II  are  supplied,  any  other _n_a_m_e arguments are ignored; these
              completions only apply to the case specified by the option.

              The process of applying  these  completion  specifications  when
              word  completion  is attempted is described above under PPrrooggrraamm--
              mmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn.

              Other options, if specified, have the following  meanings.   The
              arguments  to the --GG, --WW, and --XX options (and, if necessary, the
              --PP and --SS options) should be quoted to protect them from  expan-
              sion before the ccoommpplleettee builtin is invoked.

                      The  _c_o_m_p_-_o_p_t_i_o_n  controls  several aspects of the comp-
                      spec's behavior beyond the simple generation of  comple-
                      tions.  _c_o_m_p_-_o_p_t_i_o_n may be one of:

                      ffiilleennaammeess
                              Tell readline that the compspec generates  file-
                              names,  so  it can perform any filename-specific
                              processing (like adding  a  slash  to  directory
                              names,  quoting special characters, or suppress-
                              ing trailing spaces).  Intended to be used  with
                              shell functions.
                      nnooqquuoottee Tell  readline  not to quote the completed words
                              if they are filenames (quoting filenames is  the
                              default).
                      nnoossoorrtt  Tell  readline  not to sort the list of possible

                      nnoossppaaccee Tell readline not to append  a  space  (the  de-

                              line.
                      pplluussddiirrss
                              After any matches defined by  the  compspec  are
                              generated,  directory  name  completion  is  at-

                      _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is executed in a subshell environment,  and  its
                      output  is  used as the possible completions.  Arguments
                      are passed as with the --FF option.
              --FF _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
                      The shell function _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n is executed in  the  current
                      shell  environment.   When the function is executed, the
                      first argument ($$11) is the name of the command whose ar-
                      guments are being completed, the second argument ($$22) is
                      the word being completed, and the third argument ($$33) is
                      the  word preceding the word being completed on the cur-
                      rent command line.  When it finishes, the possible  com-

                      The pathname expansion pattern _g_l_o_b_p_a_t  is  expanded  to
                      generate the possible completions.
              --PP _p_r_e_f_i_x
                      _p_r_e_f_i_x  is  added at the beginning of each possible com-
                      pletion after all other options have been applied.
              --SS _s_u_f_f_i_x
                      _s_u_f_f_i_x is appended to each possible completion after all
                      other options have been applied.
              --WW _w_o_r_d_l_i_s_t
                      The  _w_o_r_d_l_i_s_t  is  split using the characters in the IIFFSS
                      special variable as delimiters, and each resultant  word
                      is  expanded.  Shell quoting is honored within _w_o_r_d_l_i_s_t,
                      in order to provide a mechanism for the words to contain
                      shell  metacharacters or characters in the value of IIFFSS.
                      The possible completions are the members of  the  resul-
                      tant list which match the word being completed.
              --XX _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t
                      _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t  is  a pattern as used for pathname expansion.
                      It is applied to the list of possible completions gener-
                      ated  by  the  preceding options and arguments, and each
                      completion matching _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is removed from the  list.
                      A  leading  !!  in _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t negates the pattern; in this
                      case, any completion not matching _f_i_l_t_e_r_p_a_t is removed.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option  is  supplied,
              an  option  other than --pp or --rr is supplied without a _n_a_m_e argu-
              ment, an attempt is made to remove  a  completion  specification
              for a _n_a_m_e for which no specification exists, or an error occurs
              adding a completion specification.

              tions  for  each  _n_a_m_e  or the current completion.  The possible
              values of _o_p_t_i_o_n are those valid for the  ccoommpplleettee  builtin  de-
              scribed  above.  The --DD option indicates that other supplied op-
              tions should apply to the ``default'' command  completion;  that
              is,  completion  attempted  on a command for which no completion
              has previously been defined.  The --EE option indicates that other
              supplied  options  should apply to ``empty'' command completion;
              that is, completion attempted on a blank line.   The  --II  option
              indicates that other supplied options should apply to completion
              on the initial non-assignment word on the line, or after a  com-
              mand  delimiter  such  as  ;; or ||, which is usually command name
              completion.

              The return value is true unless an invalid option  is  supplied,
              an attempt is made to modify the options for a _n_a_m_e for which no

              Declare  variables and/or give them attributes.  If no _n_a_m_es are
              given then display the values of variables.  The --pp option  will
              display the attributes and values of each _n_a_m_e.  When --pp is used
              with _n_a_m_e arguments, additional options, other than --ff  and  --FF,
              are  ignored.   When  --pp  is supplied without _n_a_m_e arguments, it
              will display the attributes and values of all  variables  having
              the attributes specified by the additional options.  If no other
              options are supplied with  --pp,  ddeeccllaarree  will  display  the  at-
              tributes  and values of all shell variables.  The --ff option will
              restrict the display to shell functions.  The --FF option inhibits
              the  display of function definitions; only the function name and
              attributes are printed.  If the eexxttddeebbuugg shell option is enabled
              using  sshhoopptt,  the  source  file name and line number where each
              _n_a_m_e is defined are displayed as well.  The  --FF  option  implies
              --ff.  The --gg option forces variables to be created or modified at
              the global scope, even when ddeeccllaarree is executed in a shell func-
              tion.   It  is ignored in all other cases.  The --II option causes
              local variables to inherit the attributes  (except  the  _n_a_m_e_r_e_f
              attribute) and value of any existing variable with the same _n_a_m_e
              at a surrounding scope.  If there is no existing  variable,  the
              local variable is initially unset.  The following options can be
              used to restrict output to variables with the  specified  attri-
              bute or to give variables attributes:
              --aa     Each  _n_a_m_e  is  an  indexed  array  variable  (see AArrrraayyss
                     above).
              --AA     Each _n_a_m_e is an associative array  variable  (see  AArrrraayyss
                     above).
              --ff     Use function names only.
              --ii     The variable is treated as an integer; arithmetic evalua-
                     tion (see AARRIITTHHMMEETTIICC EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN above) is performed  when
                     the variable is assigned a value.
              --ll     When  the  variable  is  assigned a value, all upper-case
                     characters are converted to lower-case.   The  upper-case
                     attribute is disabled.
              --nn     Give  each  _n_a_m_e  the _n_a_m_e_r_e_f attribute, making it a name
                     reference to another variable.  That  other  variable  is
                     defined  by  the  value of _n_a_m_e.  All references, assign-
                     ments, and attribute modifications to _n_a_m_e, except  those
                     using  or changing the --nn attribute itself, are performed
                     on the variable referenced by _n_a_m_e's value.  The  nameref
                     attribute cannot be applied to array variables.
              --rr     Make _n_a_m_es readonly.  These names cannot then be assigned
                     values by subsequent assignment statements or unset.
              --tt     Give each _n_a_m_e the _t_r_a_c_e attribute.  Traced functions in-
                     herit  the DDEEBBUUGG and RREETTUURRNN traps from the calling shell.
                     The trace attribute has no special meaning for variables.
              --uu     When the variable is assigned  a  value,  all  lower-case
                     characters  are  converted to upper-case.  The lower-case
                     attribute is disabled.
              --xx     Mark _n_a_m_es for export to subsequent commands via the  en-
                     vironment.

              Using  `+'  instead of `-' turns off the attribute instead, with
              the exceptions that ++aa and ++AA may not be used to  destroy  array
              variables  and  ++rr will not remove the readonly attribute.  When
              used in a function, ddeeccllaarree and ttyyppeesseett make each _n_a_m_e local, as
              with  the llooccaall command, unless the --gg option is supplied.  If a
              variable name is followed by =_v_a_l_u_e, the value of  the  variable
              is  set  to _v_a_l_u_e.  When using --aa or --AA and the compound assign-
              ment syntax to create array variables, additional attributes  do
              not  take effect until subsequent assignments.  The return value
              is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an attempt is made
              to define a function using ``-f foo=bar'', an attempt is made to
              assign a value to a readonly variable, an attempt is made to as-
              sign a value to an array variable without using the compound as-
              signment syntax (see AArrrraayyss above), one of the _n_a_m_e_s  is  not  a
              valid  shell variable name, an attempt is made to turn off read-
              only status for a readonly variable, an attempt is made to  turn
              off array status for an array variable, or an attempt is made to
              display a non-existent function with --ff.

       ddiirrss [[--ccllppvv]] [[++_n]] [[--_n]]
              Without options, displays the list of currently  remembered  di-
              rectories.   The default display is on a single line with direc-
              tory names separated by spaces.  Directories are  added  to  the
              list  with  the  ppuusshhdd command; the ppooppdd command removes entries
              from the list.  The current directory is always the first direc-
              tory in the stack.
              --cc     Clears  the  directory  stack  by deleting all of the en-
                     tries.
              --ll     Produces a listing  using  full  pathnames;  the  default
                     listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.
              --pp     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
              --vv     Print  the  directory stack with one entry per line, pre-
                     fixing each entry with its index in the stack.
              ++_n     Displays the _nth entry counting from the left of the list
                     shown by ddiirrss when invoked without options, starting with
                     zero.
              --_n     Displays the _nth entry counting from  the  right  of  the
                     list shown by ddiirrss when invoked without options, starting
                     with zero.

              The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or  _n
              indexes beyond the end of the directory stack.

       ddiissoowwnn [--aarr] [--hh] [_j_o_b_s_p_e_c ... | _p_i_d ... ]
              Without  options,  remove  each _j_o_b_s_p_e_c from the table of active
              jobs.  If _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is not present, and neither the --aa nor the  --rr
              option  is  supplied, the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b is used.  If the --hh option
              is given, each _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is not removed from  the  table,  but  is
              marked  so  that  SSIIGGHHUUPP is not sent to the job if the shell re-
              ceives a SSIIGGHHUUPP.  If no _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is supplied, the --aa option means
              to  remove or mark all jobs; the --rr option without a _j_o_b_s_p_e_c ar-
              gument restricts operation to running jobs.  The return value is
              0 unless a _j_o_b_s_p_e_c does not specify a valid job.

              Output  the  _a_r_gs,  separated  by spaces, followed by a newline.
              The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs.   If  --nn  is
              specified, the trailing newline is suppressed.  If the --ee option
              is given,  interpretation  of  the  following  backslash-escaped

              tion of these escape characters, even on systems where they  are
              interpreted  by  default.  The xxppgg__eecchhoo shell option may be used
              to dynamically determine whether or not eecchhoo expands  these  es-
              cape  characters by default.  eecchhoo does not interpret ---- to mean
              the end of options.  eecchhoo interprets the  following  escape  se-
              quences:

              Enable  and disable builtin shell commands.  Disabling a builtin
              allows a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin
              to  be  executed without specifying a full pathname, even though
              the shell normally searches for builtins before  disk  commands.
              If  --nn  is used, each _n_a_m_e is disabled; otherwise, _n_a_m_e_s are en-
              abled.  For example, to use the tteesstt binary found via  the  PPAATTHH
              instead  of  the  shell builtin version, run ``enable -n test''.
              The --ff option means to load the new builtin  command  _n_a_m_e  from
              shared object _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e, on systems that support dynamic loading.

              colon-separated list of directories in which to search for _f_i_l_e_-
              _n_a_m_e.  The default is  system-dependent.   The  --dd  option  will
              delete  a  builtin  previously loaded with --ff.  If no _n_a_m_e argu-
              ments are given, or if the --pp option  is  supplied,  a  list  of
              shell  builtins is printed.  With no other option arguments, the
              list consists of all enabled shell builtins.  If --nn is supplied,
              only disabled builtins are printed.  If --aa is supplied, the list
              printed includes all builtins, with an indication of whether  or
              not  each  is  enabled.   If  --ss  is supplied, the output is re-
              stricted to the POSIX _s_p_e_c_i_a_l builtins.  If no options are  sup-
              plied  and a _n_a_m_e is not a shell builtin, eennaabbllee will attempt to
              load _n_a_m_e from a shared object named _n_a_m_e,  as  if  the  command
              were  ``enable  -f  _n_a_m_e  _n_a_m_e .  The return value is 0 unless a
              _n_a_m_e is not a shell builtin or there is an error loading  a  new
              builtin from a shared object.

       eevvaall [_a_r_g ...]
              The  _a_r_gs  are read and concatenated together into a single com-
              mand.  This command is then read and executed by the shell,  and
              its  exit status is returned as the value of eevvaall.  If there are
              no _a_r_g_s, or only null arguments, eevvaall returns 0.

       eexxeecc [--ccll] [--aa _n_a_m_e] [_c_o_m_m_a_n_d [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]]
              If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new  process
              is  created.  The _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s become the arguments to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  If
              the --ll option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the begin-
              ning of the zeroth argument passed to _c_o_m_m_a_n_d.  This is what _l_o_-
              _g_i_n(1) does.  The --cc option causes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d to be  executed  with
              an  empty environment.  If --aa is supplied, the shell passes _n_a_m_e
              as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d can-
              not  be executed for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits,
              unless the eexxeeccffaaiill shell option is enabled.  In that  case,  it
              returns  failure.   An  interactive shell returns failure if the
              file cannot be executed.  A subshell  exits  unconditionally  if
              eexxeecc  fails.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is not specified, any redirections take
              effect in the current shell, and the return  status  is  0.   If
              there is a redirection error, the return status is 1.

       eexxiitt [_n]
              Cause  the  shell  to exit with a status of _n.  If _n is omitted,
              the exit status is that of the last command executed.  A trap on
              EEXXIITT is executed before the shell terminates.

       eexxppoorrtt [--ffnn] [_n_a_m_e[=_w_o_r_d]] ...
       eexxppoorrtt --pp
              The  supplied _n_a_m_e_s are marked for automatic export to the envi-
              ronment of subsequently executed commands.  If the --ff option  is
              given,  the _n_a_m_e_s refer to functions.  If no _n_a_m_e_s are given, or
              if the --pp option is supplied, a list of names  of  all  exported
              variables  is printed.  The --nn option causes the export property
              to be removed from each _n_a_m_e.  If a variable name is followed by
              =_w_o_r_d, the value of the variable is set to _w_o_r_d.  eexxppoorrtt returns
              an exit status of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one
              of  the  _n_a_m_e_s is not a valid shell variable name, or --ff is sup-
              plied with a _n_a_m_e that is not a function.

       ffcc [--ee _e_n_a_m_e] [--llnnrr] [_f_i_r_s_t] [_l_a_s_t]
       ffcc --ss [_p_a_t=_r_e_p] [_c_m_d]
              The first form selects a range of commands from  _f_i_r_s_t  to  _l_a_s_t
              from  the  history  list  and  displays or edits and re-executes
              them.  _F_i_r_s_t and _l_a_s_t may be specified as a  string  (to  locate
              the  last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an
              index into the history list, where a negative number is used  as
              an  offset  from  the  current command number).  When listing, a
              _f_i_r_s_t or _l_a_s_t of 0 is equivalent to -1 and -0 is  equivalent  to
              the  current  command  (usually  the ffcc command); otherwise 0 is
              equivalent to -1 and -0 is invalid.  If _l_a_s_t is  not  specified,
              it  is  set  to the current command for listing (so that ``fc -l
              -10'' prints the last 10 commands) and to _f_i_r_s_t  otherwise.   If
              _f_i_r_s_t  is  not  specified, it is set to the previous command for
              editing and -16 for listing.

              The --nn option suppresses the command numbers when listing.   The
              --rr  option reverses the order of the commands.  If the --ll option
              is given, the commands are listed on  standard  output.   Other-
              wise,  the editor given by _e_n_a_m_e is invoked on a file containing
              those commands.  If _e_n_a_m_e is not given, the value of the  FFCCEEDDIITT
              variable  is used, and the value of EEDDIITTOORR if FFCCEEDDIITT is not set.
              If neither variable is set, _v_i is used.  When  editing  is  com-
              plete, the edited commands are echoed and executed.

              In  the  second form, _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is re-executed after each instance
              of _p_a_t is replaced by _r_e_p.  _C_o_m_m_a_n_d is interpreted the  same  as
              _f_i_r_s_t  above.  A useful alias to use with this is ``r="fc -s"'',
              so that typing ``r cc'' runs the  last  command  beginning  with
              ``cc'' and typing ``r'' re-executes the last command.

              If  the  first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an in-
              valid option is encountered or _f_i_r_s_t  or  _l_a_s_t  specify  history
              lines  out  of  range.  If the --ee option is supplied, the return
              value is the value of the last command executed or failure if an
              error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second
              form is used, the return status is that of the  command  re-exe-
              cuted,  unless  _c_m_d  does  not  specify a valid history line, in
              which case ffcc returns failure.

       ffgg [_j_o_b_s_p_e_c]
              Resume _j_o_b_s_p_e_c in the foreground, and make it the  current  job.
              If _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is not present, the shell's notion of the _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _j_o_b
              is used.  The return value is that of the  command  placed  into
              the  foreground,  or failure if run when job control is disabled
              or, when run with job control enabled, if _j_o_b_s_p_e_c does not spec-
              ify  a  valid  job  or  _j_o_b_s_p_e_c specifies a job that was started
              without job control.

       ggeettooppttss _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g _n_a_m_e [_a_r_g _._._.]
              ggeettooppttss is used by shell procedures to parse positional  parame-
              ters.   _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g  contains  the  option characters to be recog-
              nized; if a character is followed by a colon, the option is  ex-
              pected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by
              white space.  The colon and question mark characters may not  be
              used  as  option  characters.   Each time it is invoked, ggeettooppttss
              places the next option in the shell variable _n_a_m_e,  initializing
              _n_a_m_e if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to
              be processed into the variable OOPPTTIINNDD.  OOPPTTIINNDD is initialized to
              1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked.  When an op-
              tion requires an argument, ggeettooppttss places that argument into the
              variable OOPPTTAARRGG.  The shell does not reset OOPPTTIINNDD automatically;
              it must be manually reset  between  multiple  calls  to  ggeettooppttss
              within  the  same shell invocation if a new set of parameters is
              to be used.

              When the end of options is encountered, ggeettooppttss exits with a re-
              turn value greater than zero.  OOPPTTIINNDD is set to the index of the
              first non-option argument, and _n_a_m_e is set to ?.

              ggeettooppttss normally parses the positional parameters, but  if  more
              arguments  are  supplied as _a_r_g values, ggeettooppttss parses those in-
              stead.

              ggeettooppttss can report errors in two ways.  If the  first  character
              of  _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g  is  a  colon, _s_i_l_e_n_t error reporting is used.  In
              normal operation, diagnostic messages are printed  when  invalid
              options  or  missing  option  arguments are encountered.  If the
              variable OOPPTTEERRRR is set to 0, no  error  messages  will  be  dis-
              played, even if the first character of _o_p_t_s_t_r_i_n_g is not a colon.

              If an invalid option is seen, ggeettooppttss places ? into _n_a_m_e and, if
              not silent, prints an  error  message  and  unsets  OOPPTTAARRGG.   If
              ggeettooppttss  is  silent, the option character found is placed in OOPP--
              TTAARRGG and no diagnostic message is printed.

              If a required argument is not found, and ggeettooppttss is not  silent,
              a  question  mark  (??) is placed in _n_a_m_e, OOPPTTAARRGG is unset, and a
              diagnostic message is printed.  If ggeettooppttss  is  silent,  then  a
              colon  (::)  is  placed  in  _n_a_m_e and OOPPTTAARRGG is set to the option
              character found.

              ggeettooppttss returns true if an option, specified or unspecified,  is
              found.  It returns false if the end of options is encountered or
              an error occurs.

       hhaasshh [--llrr] [--pp _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e] [--ddtt] [_n_a_m_e]
              Each time hhaasshh is invoked, the full pathname of the command _n_a_m_e
              is  determined  by searching the directories in $$PPAATTHH and remem-
              bered.  Any previously-remembered pathname is discarded.  If the
              --pp option is supplied, no path search is performed, and _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              is used as the full filename of  the  command.   The  --rr  option
              causes the shell to forget all remembered locations.  The --dd op-
              tion causes the shell to forget the remembered location of  each
              _n_a_m_e.   If the --tt option is supplied, the full pathname to which
              each _n_a_m_e corresponds is printed.  If  multiple  _n_a_m_e  arguments
              are supplied with --tt, the _n_a_m_e is printed before the hashed full
              pathname.  The --ll option causes output to be displayed in a for-
              mat  that may be reused as input.  If no arguments are given, or
              if only --ll is supplied, information about remembered commands is
              printed.   The  return status is true unless a _n_a_m_e is not found
              or an invalid option is supplied.

              Display helpful information about builtin commands.  If  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              is  specified, hheellpp gives detailed help on all commands matching
              _p_a_t_t_e_r_n; otherwise help for all the builtins and  shell  control

              With no options, display the command history list with line num-
              bers.  Lines listed with a ** have been modified.  An argument of
              _n lists only the last _n lines.  If the shell variable  HHIISSTTTTIIMMEE--
              FFOORRMMAATT  is  set  and not null, it is used as a format string for
              _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e(3) to display the time stamp associated with each  dis-
              played  history  entry.  No intervening blank is printed between
              the formatted time stamp and the history line.  If  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e  is
              supplied,  it  is  used as the name of the history file; if not,
              the value of HHIISSTTFFIILLEE is used.  Options, if supplied,  have  the
              following meanings:
              --cc     Clear the history list by deleting all the entries.
              --dd _o_f_f_s_e_t
                     Delete  the  history entry at position _o_f_f_s_e_t.  If _o_f_f_s_e_t
                     is negative, it is interpreted as relative to one greater
                     than the last history position, so negative indices count
                     back from the end of the history,  and  an  index  of  -1
                     refers to the current hhiissttoorryy --dd command.
              --dd _s_t_a_r_t-_e_n_d
                     Delete  the  range  of  history entries between positions
                     _s_t_a_r_t and _e_n_d, inclusive.  Positive and  negative  values
                     for _s_t_a_r_t and _e_n_d are interpreted as described above.
              --aa     Append  the  ``new''  history  lines to the history file.
                     These are history lines entered since  the  beginning  of

                     history file.
              --nn     Read the history lines not already read from the  history
                     file  into the current history list.  These are lines ap-
                     pended to the history file since  the  beginning  of  the
                     current bbaasshh session.
              --rr     Read  the contents of the history file and append them to
                     the current history list.
              --ww     Write the current history list to the history file, over-
                     writing the history file's contents.
              --pp     Perform  history  substitution  on the following _a_r_g_s and
                     display the result on  the  standard  output.   Does  not
                     store  the results in the history list.  Each _a_r_g must be
                     quoted to disable normal history expansion.
              --ss     Store the _a_r_g_s in the history list  as  a  single  entry.
                     The  last  command  in the history list is removed before
                     the _a_r_g_s are added.

              If the HHIISSTTTTIIMMEEFFOORRMMAATT variable is set, the time  stamp  informa-
              tion  associated  with each history entry is written to the his-
              tory file, marked with the history comment character.  When  the
              history  file  is read, lines beginning with the history comment
              character followed immediately by a  digit  are  interpreted  as
              timestamps for the following history entry.  The return value is
              0 unless an invalid option is encountered, an error occurs while
              reading  or writing the history file, an invalid _o_f_f_s_e_t or range
              is supplied as an argument to --dd, or the history expansion  sup-
              plied as an argument to --pp fails.

              The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the fol-
              lowing meanings:
              --ll     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
              --nn     Display information only about  jobs  that  have  changed
                     status since the user was last notified of their status.
              --pp     List  only  the  process  ID  of  the job's process group
                     leader.
              --rr     Display only running jobs.
              --ss     Display only stopped jobs.

              If _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is given, output is restricted to  information  about
              that  job.   The  return status is 0 unless an invalid option is
              encountered or an invalid _j_o_b_s_p_e_c is supplied.

              If the --xx option is supplied, jjoobbss replaces any _j_o_b_s_p_e_c found in
              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d or _a_r_g_s with the corresponding process group ID, and ex-
              ecutes _c_o_m_m_a_n_d passing it _a_r_g_s, returning its exit status.

              Send the signal named by _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  or  _s_i_g_n_u_m  to  the  processes
              named  by  _p_i_d or _j_o_b_s_p_e_c.  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is either a case-insensitive
              signal name such as SSIIGGKKIILLLL (with or without the SSIIGG prefix)  or
              a  signal  number; _s_i_g_n_u_m is a signal number.  If _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is not
              present, then SSIIGGTTEERRMM is assumed.  An argument of --ll  lists  the
              signal  names.   If any arguments are supplied when --ll is given,
              the names of the signals  corresponding  to  the  arguments  are
              listed, and the return status is 0.  The _e_x_i_t___s_t_a_t_u_s argument to
              --ll is a number specifying either a signal  number  or  the  exit
              status  of  a  process terminated by a signal.  The --LL option is
              equivalent to --ll.  kkiillll returns true if at least one signal  was
              successfully sent, or false if an error occurs or an invalid op-
              tion is encountered.

       lleett _a_r_g [_a_r_g ...]
              Each _a_r_g is an arithmetic expression to be evaluated (see AARRIITTHH--
              MMEETTIICC  EEVVAALLUUAATTIIOONN  above).   If the last _a_r_g evaluates to 0, lleett

              For each argument, a local variable named _n_a_m_e is  created,  and
              assigned  _v_a_l_u_e.   The _o_p_t_i_o_n can be any of the options accepted
              by ddeeccllaarree.  When llooccaall is used within a function, it causes the
              variable  _n_a_m_e  to have a visible scope restricted to that func-
              tion and its children.  If _n_a_m_e is -, the set of  shell  options
              is  made  local to the function in which llooccaall is invoked: shell
              options changed using the sseett builtin inside  the  function  are
              restored  to  their  original  values when the function returns.
              The restore is effected as if a series of sseett commands were exe-
              cuted  to restore the values that were in place before the func-
              tion.  With no operands, llooccaall writes a list of local  variables
              to  the  standard  output.  It is an error to use llooccaall when not
              within a function.  The return status is 0 unless llooccaall is  used
              outside  a  function,  an invalid _n_a_m_e is supplied, or _n_a_m_e is a

              Read lines from the standard input into the indexed array  vari-
              able  _a_r_r_a_y, or from file descriptor _f_d if the --uu option is sup-
              plied.  The variable MMAAPPFFIILLEE is the default _a_r_r_a_y.  Options,  if
              supplied, have the following meanings:
              --dd     The  first  character  of _d_e_l_i_m is used to terminate each
                     input line, rather than newline.  If _d_e_l_i_m is  the  empty
                     string, mmaappffiillee will terminate a line when it reads a NUL
                     character.
              --nn     Copy at most _c_o_u_n_t lines.  If _c_o_u_n_t is 0, all  lines  are

                     read.
              --uu     Read  lines  from file descriptor _f_d instead of the stan-
                     dard input.

                     --cc option specifies _q_u_a_n_t_u_m.
              --cc     Specify  the  number  of  lines read between each call to
                     _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k.

              If --CC is specified without --cc,  the  default  quantum  is  5000.
              When _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k is evaluated, it is supplied the index of the next
              array element to be assigned and the line to be assigned to that
              element  as  additional  arguments.  _c_a_l_l_b_a_c_k is evaluated after
              the line is read but before the array element is assigned.

              If not supplied with an explicit origin, mmaappffiillee will clear  _a_r_-
              _r_a_y before assigning to it.

              mmaappffiillee  returns successfully unless an invalid option or option
              argument is supplied, _a_r_r_a_y is invalid or  unassignable,  or  if
              _a_r_r_a_y is not an indexed array.

       ppooppdd [-nn] [+_n] [-_n]
              Removes entries from the directory stack.  The elements are num-
              bered from 0 starting at the first  directory  listed  by  ddiirrss.
              With  no  arguments,  ppooppdd  removes  the  top directory from the
              stack, and changes to the new top directory.  Arguments, if sup-
              plied, have the following meanings:
              --nn     Suppresses  the  normal change of directory when removing
                     directories from the stack, so that only the stack is ma-
                     nipulated.
              ++_n     Removes  the _nth entry counting from the left of the list
                     shown by ddiirrss, starting with zero, from the  stack.   For
                     example:  ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd
                     +1'' the second.
              --_n     Removes the _nth entry counting from the right of the list
                     shown  by  ddiirrss, starting with zero.  For example: ``popd
                     -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next  to
                     last.

              If  the  top element of the directory stack is modified, and the
              _-_n option was not supplied, ppooppdd uses the ccdd builtin  to  change
              to the directory at the top of the stack.  If the ccdd fails, ppooppdd
              returns a non-zero value.

              Otherwise, ppooppdd returns false if an invalid  option  is  encoun-
              tered, the directory stack is empty, or a non-existent directory
              stack entry is specified.

              If the ppooppdd command is successful, bash runs ddiirrss  to  show  the
              final  contents of the directory stack, and the return status is
              0.

       pprriinnttff [--vv _v_a_r] _f_o_r_m_a_t [_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s]
              Write the formatted _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s to the standard output  under  the
              control  of  the  _f_o_r_m_a_t.  The --vv option causes the output to be
              assigned to the variable _v_a_r rather than being  printed  to  the
              standard output.

              The  _f_o_r_m_a_t  is a character string which contains three types of
              objects: plain characters, which are simply copied  to  standard
              output,  character  escape  sequences,  which  are converted and
              copied to the standard output, and format  specifications,  each
              of  which  causes  printing of the next successive _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t.  In
              addition to the standard _p_r_i_n_t_f(1) format specifications, pprriinnttff
              interprets the following extensions:
              %%bb     causes pprriinnttff to expand backslash escape sequences in the
                     corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t in the same way as eecchhoo --ee.
              %%qq     causes pprriinnttff to output the corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t  in  a
                     format that can be reused as shell input.
              %%QQ     like  %%qq, but applies any supplied precision to the _a_r_g_u_-
                     _m_e_n_t before quoting it.
              %%((_d_a_t_e_f_m_t))TT
                     causes pprriinnttff to output the  date-time  string  resulting
                     from  using  _d_a_t_e_f_m_t  as a format string for _s_t_r_f_t_i_m_e(3).
                     The corresponding _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t is an integer representing the
                     number  of seconds since the epoch.  Two special argument
                     values may be used: -1 represents the current  time,  and
                     -2  represents the time the shell was invoked.  If no ar-
                     gument is specified, conversion behaves as if -1 had been
                     given.   This  is an exception to the usual pprriinnttff behav-
                     ior.

              The %b, %q, and %T directives all use the field width and preci-
              sion arguments from the format specification and write that many
              bytes from (or use that wide a field for) the expanded argument,
              which usually contains more characters than the original.

              Arguments  to non-string format specifiers are treated as C con-
              stants, except that a leading plus or minus sign is allowed, and
              if  the leading character is a single or double quote, the value
              is the ASCII value of the following character.

              The _f_o_r_m_a_t is reused as necessary to consume all  of  the  _a_r_g_u_-
              _m_e_n_t_s.  If the _f_o_r_m_a_t requires more _a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s than are supplied,
              the extra format specifications behave as if  a  zero  value  or
              null  string,  as  appropriate,  had  been supplied.  The return
              value is zero on success, non-zero on failure.

       ppuusshhdd [--nn] [+_n] [-_n]
       ppuusshhdd [--nn] [_d_i_r]
              Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack,  or  rotates
              the  stack,  making the new top of the stack the current working
              directory.  With no arguments, ppuusshhdd exchanges the top two  ele-
              ments  of the directory stack.  Arguments, if supplied, have the
              following meanings:
              --nn     Suppresses the normal change of directory  when  rotating
                     or  adding  directories  to  the  stack, so that only the
                     stack is manipulated.
              ++_n     Rotates the stack so that  the  _nth  directory  (counting
                     from  the  left  of the list shown by ddiirrss, starting with
                     zero) is at the top.
              --_n     Rotates the stack so that  the  _nth  directory  (counting
                     from  the  right of the list shown by ddiirrss, starting with
                     zero) is at the top.
              _d_i_r    Adds _d_i_r to the directory stack at the top

              After the stack has been modified, if the --nn option was not sup-
              plied,  ppuusshhdd  uses the ccdd builtin to change to the directory at
              the top of the stack.  If the ccdd fails, ppuusshhdd returns a non-zero
              value.

              Otherwise,  if no arguments are supplied, ppuusshhdd returns 0 unless
              the directory stack  is  empty.   When  rotating  the  directory
              stack,  ppuusshhdd returns 0 unless the directory stack is empty or a
              non-existent directory stack element is specified.

              If the ppuusshhdd command is successful, bash runs ddiirrss to  show  the
              final contents of the directory stack.

       ppwwdd [--LLPP]
              Print  the  absolute  pathname of the current working directory.
              The pathname printed contains no symbolic links if the --PP option
              is supplied or the --oo pphhyyssiiccaall option to the sseett builtin command
              is enabled.  If the --LL option is used, the pathname printed  may
              contain  symbolic links.  The return status is 0 unless an error
              occurs while reading the name of the current directory or an in-
              valid option is supplied.

       rreeaadd [--eerrss] [--aa _a_n_a_m_e] [--dd _d_e_l_i_m] [--ii _t_e_x_t] [--nn _n_c_h_a_r_s] [--NN _n_c_h_a_r_s] [--pp

              One line is read from the standard input, or from the  file  de-
              scriptor _f_d supplied as an argument to the --uu option, split into
              words as described above under WWoorrdd  SSpplliittttiinngg,  and  the  first
              word  is assigned to the first _n_a_m_e, the second word to the sec-
              ond _n_a_m_e, and so on.  If there are more words  than  names,  the
              remaining words and their intervening delimiters are assigned to
              the last _n_a_m_e.  If there are fewer words  read  from  the  input
              stream  than  names, the remaining names are assigned empty val-
              ues.  The characters in IIFFSS are used  to  split  the  line  into
              words  using  the  same  rules the shell uses for expansion (de-
              scribed above under WWoorrdd SSpplliittttiinngg).   The  backslash  character
              (\\) may be used to remove any special meaning for the next char-
              acter read and for line  continuation.   Options,  if  supplied,
              have the following meanings:
              --aa _a_n_a_m_e
                     The words are assigned to sequential indices of the array
                     variable _a_n_a_m_e, starting at 0.  _a_n_a_m_e is unset before any
                     new  values  are  assigned.  Other _n_a_m_e arguments are ig-
                     nored.
              --dd _d_e_l_i_m
                     The first character of _d_e_l_i_m is used to terminate the in-
                     put  line,  rather  than  newline.  If _d_e_l_i_m is the empty
                     string, rreeaadd will terminate a line when it  reads  a  NUL
                     character.
              --ee     If the standard input is coming from a terminal, rreeaaddlliinnee
                     (see RREEAADDLLIINNEE above) is used to obtain the  line.   Read-
                     line  uses  the  current (or default, if line editing was
                     not previously active) editing settings, but  uses  read-
                     line's default filename completion.
              --ii _t_e_x_t
                     If  rreeaaddlliinnee  is  being  used  to  read the line, _t_e_x_t is
                     placed into the editing buffer before editing begins.
              --nn _n_c_h_a_r_s
                     rreeaadd returns after reading _n_c_h_a_r_s characters rather  than
                     waiting for a complete line of input, but honors a delim-
                     iter if fewer than _n_c_h_a_r_s characters are read before  the
                     delimiter.
              --NN _n_c_h_a_r_s
                     rreeaadd  returns  after  reading  exactly  _n_c_h_a_r_s characters
                     rather than waiting for a complete line of input,  unless
                     EOF  is encountered or rreeaadd times out.  Delimiter charac-
                     ters encountered in the input are not  treated  specially
                     and  do  not cause rreeaadd to return until _n_c_h_a_r_s characters
                     are read.  The result is not split on the  characters  in
                     IIFFSS;  the intent is that the variable is assigned exactly
                     the characters read (with the exception of backslash; see
                     the --rr option below).
              --pp _p_r_o_m_p_t
                     Display _p_r_o_m_p_t on standard error, without a trailing new-
                     line, before attempting to read any input.  The prompt is
                     displayed only if input is coming from a terminal.
              --rr     Backslash does not act as an escape character.  The back-
                     slash is considered to be part of the line.  In  particu-
                     lar,  a  backslash-newline pair may not then be used as a
                     line continuation.
              --ss     Silent mode.  If input is coming from a terminal, charac-
                     ters are not echoed.
              --tt _t_i_m_e_o_u_t
                     Cause  rreeaadd  to time out and return failure if a complete
                     line of input (or a specified number  of  characters)  is
                     not  read within _t_i_m_e_o_u_t seconds.  _t_i_m_e_o_u_t may be a deci-
                     mal number with a fractional portion following the  deci-
                     mal  point.   This  option  is  only effective if rreeaadd is
                     reading input from a terminal,  pipe,  or  other  special
                     file;  it  has no effect when reading from regular files.
                     If rreeaadd times out, rreeaadd saves any partial input read into
                     the  specified  variable _n_a_m_e.  If _t_i_m_e_o_u_t is 0, rreeaadd re-
                     turns immediately, without trying to read any data.   The
                     exit  status  is 0 if input is available on the specified
                     file descriptor, or the read will  return  EOF,  non-zero
                     otherwise.   The  exit  status is greater than 128 if the
                     timeout is exceeded.
              --uu _f_d  Read input from file descriptor _f_d.

              If no _n_a_m_e_s are supplied, the line read, without the ending  de-
              limiter  but  otherwise  unmodified, is assigned to the variable
              RREEPPLLYY.  The exit status is zero, unless end-of-file  is  encoun-
              tered,  rreeaadd times out (in which case the status is greater than
              128), a variable assignment error (such as assigning to a  read-
              only variable) occurs, or an invalid file descriptor is supplied
              as the argument to --uu.

       rreeaaddoonnllyy [--aaAAff] [--pp] [_n_a_m_e[=_w_o_r_d] ...]
              The given _n_a_m_e_s are marked readonly; the values of  these  _n_a_m_e_s
              may  not  be changed by subsequent assignment.  If the --ff option
              is supplied, the functions corresponding to  the  _n_a_m_e_s  are  so
              marked.   The  --aa  option restricts the variables to indexed ar-
              rays; the --AA option restricts the variables to  associative  ar-
              rays.  If both options are supplied, --AA takes precedence.  If no
              _n_a_m_e arguments are given, or if the --pp  option  is  supplied,  a
              list of all readonly names is printed.  The other options may be
              used to restrict the output to a subset of the set  of  readonly
              names.   The --pp option causes output to be displayed in a format
              that may be reused as input.  If a variable name is followed  by
              =_w_o_r_d,  the  value  of  the variable is set to _w_o_r_d.  The return
              status is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of  the
              _n_a_m_e_s is not a valid shell variable name, or --ff is supplied with
              a _n_a_m_e that is not a function.

       rreettuurrnn [_n]
              Causes a function to stop executing and return the value  speci-
              fied  by _n to its caller.  If _n is omitted, the return status is
              that of the last command executed in the function body.  If  rree--
              ttuurrnn is executed by a trap handler, the last command used to de-
              termine the status is the last command executed before the  trap
              handler.   If  rreettuurrnn  is executed during a DDEEBBUUGG trap, the last
              command used to determine the status is the  last  command  exe-
              cuted  by the trap handler before rreettuurrnn was invoked.  If rreettuurrnn
              is used outside a function, but during execution of a script  by
              the  ..   (ssoouurrccee) command, it causes the shell to stop executing
              that script and return either _n or the exit status of  the  last
              command  executed  within  the  script as the exit status of the
              script.  If _n is supplied, the return value is its least signif-
              icant  8  bits.  The return status is non-zero if rreettuurrnn is sup-
              plied a non-numeric argument, or is used outside a function  and
              not  during  execution  of a script by .. or ssoouurrccee.  Any command
              associated with the RREETTUURRNN trap is executed before execution re-
              sumes after the function or script.

              Without  options, display the name and value of each shell vari-
              able in a format that can be reused as input for setting or  re-
              setting the currently-set variables.  Read-only variables cannot
              be reset.  In _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e, only shell variables are listed.   The
              output  is sorted according to the current locale.  When options
              are specified, they set or unset shell  attributes.   Any  argu-
              ments  remaining  after  option processing are treated as values
              for the positional parameters and are assigned, in order, to $$11,
              $$22,  ......   $$_n.   Options, if specified, have the following mean-
              ings:
              --aa      Each variable or function that is created or modified is
                      given  the export attribute and marked for export to the
                      environment of subsequent commands.
              --bb      Report the status of terminated background jobs  immedi-
                      ately, rather than before the next primary prompt.  This
                      is effective only when job control is enabled.
              --ee      Exit immediately if a _p_i_p_e_l_i_n_e (which may consist  of  a
                      single  _s_i_m_p_l_e  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d),  a _l_i_s_t, or a _c_o_m_p_o_u_n_d _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
                      (see SSHHEELLLL GGRRAAMMMMAARR above), exits with a non-zero status.
                      The  shell  does  not  exit if the command that fails is
                      part of the command list immediately following  a  wwhhiillee
                      or  uunnttiill  keyword, part of the test following the iiff or
                      eelliiff reserved words, part of any command executed  in  a
                      &&&&  or |||| list except the command following the final &&&&
                      or ||||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the
                      command's  return  value is being inverted with !!.  If a
                      compound command other than a subshell  returns  a  non-
                      zero  status because a command failed while --ee was being
                      ignored, the shell does not exit.  A  trap  on  EERRRR,  if
                      set,  is  executed  before the shell exits.  This option
                      applies to the shell environment and each subshell envi-
                      ronment  separately  (see  CCOOMMMMAANNDD EEXXEECCUUTTIIOONN EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
                      above), and may cause subshells to exit before executing
                      all the commands in the subshell.

                      If  a  compound  command or shell function executes in a
                      context where --ee is being ignored, none of the  commands
                      executed  within  the  compound command or function body
                      will be affected by the --ee setting, even if  --ee  is  set
                      and  a  command returns a failure status.  If a compound
                      command or shell function sets --ee while executing  in  a
                      context  where --ee is ignored, that setting will not have
                      any effect until the compound  command  or  the  command
                      containing the function call completes.

              --kk      All arguments in the form of assignment  statements  are
                      placed  in the environment for a command, not just those
                      that precede the command name.
              --mm      Monitor mode.  Job control is enabled.  This  option  is
                      on  by  default  for  interactive shells on systems that
                      support it (see JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL above).  All  processes  run
                      in a separate process group.  When a background job com-
                      pletes, the shell prints a line containing its exit sta-
                      tus.
              --nn      Read commands but do not execute them.  This may be used
                      to check a shell script for syntax errors.  This is  ig-

                              If  set,  the  return value of a pipeline is the

                              with  a non-zero status, or zero if all commands

                              This also affects the editing interface used for

                      If --oo is supplied with no _o_p_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e, the values of the
                      current options are printed.  If ++oo is supplied with  no
                      _o_p_t_i_o_n_-_n_a_m_e,  a  series  of sseett commands to recreate the
                      current option settings is  displayed  on  the  standard
                      output.
              --pp      Turn  on  _p_r_i_v_i_l_e_g_e_d  mode.   In this mode, the $$EENNVV and
                      $$BBAASSHH__EENNVV files are not processed, shell  functions  are
                      not  inherited  from the environment, and the SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS,
                      BBAASSHHOOPPTTSS, CCDDPPAATTHH, and GGLLOOBBIIGGNNOORREE variables, if they  ap-
                      pear  in  the environment, are ignored.  If the shell is
                      started with the effective user (group) id not equal  to
                      the  real user (group) id, and the --pp option is not sup-
                      plied, these actions are taken and the effective user id
                      is  set  to  the real user id.  If the --pp option is sup-
                      plied at startup, the effective user id  is  not  reset.
                      Turning  this  option  off causes the effective user and
                      group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.
              --rr      Enable restricted shell mode.  This option cannot be un-
                      set once it has been set.
              --tt      Exit after reading and executing one command.
              --uu      Treat unset variables and parameters other than the spe-
                      cial parameters "@" and "*",  or  array  variables  sub-
                      scripted  with  "@"  or "*", as an error when performing
                      parameter expansion.  If expansion is  attempted  on  an
                      unset  variable  or parameter, the shell prints an error
                      message, and, if not interactive, exits with a  non-zero
                      status.
              --vv      Print shell input lines as they are read.
              --xx      After  expanding  each _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, ffoorr command, ccaassee
                      command, sseelleecctt command, or arithmetic ffoorr command, dis-
                      play  the expanded value of PPSS44, followed by the command
                      and its expanded arguments or associated word list.
              --BB      The shell performs brace expansion (see BBrraaccee  EExxppaannssiioonn
                      above).  This is on by default.
              --CC      If  set,  bbaasshh  does not overwrite an existing file with
                      the >>, >>&&, and <<>> redirection operators.   This  may  be
                      overridden when creating output files by using the redi-
                      rection operator >>|| instead of >>.
              --EE      If set, any trap on EERRRR is inherited by shell functions,
                      command  substitutions,  and commands executed in a sub-
                      shell environment.  The EERRRR trap is normally not  inher-
                      ited in such cases.
              --HH      Enable !!  style history substitution.  This option is on
                      by default when the shell is interactive.
              --PP      If set, the shell does not resolve symbolic  links  when
                      executing  commands  such  as ccdd that change the current
                      working  directory.   It  uses  the  physical  directory
                      structure instead.  By default, bbaasshh follows the logical
                      chain of  directories  when  performing  commands  which
                      change the current directory.
              --TT      If  set,  any traps on DDEEBBUUGG and RREETTUURRNN are inherited by
                      shell functions, command substitutions, and commands ex-
                      ecuted  in a subshell environment.  The DDEEBBUUGG and RREETTUURRNN
                      traps are normally not inherited in such cases.
              ----      If no arguments follow this option, then the  positional
                      parameters are unset.  Otherwise, the positional parame-
                      ters are set to the _a_r_gs, even if  some  of  them  begin
                      with a --.
              --       Signal  the  end of options, cause all remaining _a_r_gs to
                      be assigned to the positional parameters.  The --xx and --vv
                      options are turned off.  If there are no _a_r_gs, the posi-
                      tional parameters remain unchanged.

              The options are off by default unless otherwise noted.  Using  +
              rather  than  -  causes these options to be turned off.  The op-
              tions can also be specified as arguments to an invocation of the
              shell.   The current set of options may be found in $$--.  The re-
              turn status is always true unless an invalid option  is  encoun-
              tered.

       sshhiifftt [_n]
              The  positional  parameters  from _n+1 ... are renamed to $$11 ........
              Parameters represented by the numbers $$## down to $$##-_n+1 are  un-
              set.   _n must be a non-negative number less than or equal to $$##.
              If _n is 0, no parameters are changed.  If _n is not given, it  is
              assumed to be 1.  If _n is greater than $$##, the positional param-
              eters are not changed.  The return status is greater  than  zero
              if _n is greater than $$## or less than zero; otherwise 0.

       sshhoopptt [--ppqqssuu] [--oo] [_o_p_t_n_a_m_e ...]
              Toggle  the values of settings controlling optional shell behav-
              ior.  The settings can be either those listed below, or, if  the
              --oo option is used, those available with the --oo option to the sseett
              builtin command.  With no options, or with the --pp option, a list
              of  all  settable  options  is  displayed, with an indication of
              whether or not each is set; if _o_p_t_n_a_m_e_s are supplied, the output
              is  restricted to those options.  The --pp option causes output to
              be displayed in a form that may be reused as input.   Other  op-
              tions have the following meanings:
              --ss     Enable (set) each _o_p_t_n_a_m_e.
              --uu     Disable (unset) each _o_p_t_n_a_m_e.
              --qq     Suppresses  normal output (quiet mode); the return status
                     indicates whether the _o_p_t_n_a_m_e is set or unset.  If multi-
                     ple  _o_p_t_n_a_m_e arguments are given with --qq, the return sta-
                     tus is zero if all _o_p_t_n_a_m_e_s are enabled; non-zero  other-
                     wise.
              --oo     Restricts  the  values of _o_p_t_n_a_m_e to be those defined for
                     the --oo option to the sseett builtin.

              If either --ss or --uu is used  with  no  _o_p_t_n_a_m_e  arguments,  sshhoopptt
              shows  only  those options which are set or unset, respectively.
              Unless otherwise noted, the sshhoopptt options are  disabled  (unset)
              by default.

              The  return  status when listing options is zero if all _o_p_t_n_a_m_e_s
              are enabled, non-zero otherwise.  When setting or unsetting  op-
              tions,  the  return  status  is  zero unless an _o_p_t_n_a_m_e is not a
              valid shell option.

              The list of sshhoopptt options is:

              aassssoocc__eexxppaanndd__oonnccee
                      If set, the shell suppresses multiple evaluation of  as-
                      sociative  array subscripts during arithmetic expression
                      evaluation, while executing builtins  that  can  perform
                      variable  assignments, and while executing builtins that
                      perform array dereferencing.
              aauuttooccdd  If set, a command name that is the name of  a  directory
                      is  executed  as  if it were the argument to the ccdd com-
                      mand.  This option is only used by interactive shells.
              ccddaabbllee__vvaarrss
                      If set, an argument to the ccdd builtin  command  that  is
                      not  a directory is assumed to be the name of a variable
                      whose value is the directory to change to.
              ccddssppeellll If set, minor errors in the spelling of a directory com-
                      ponent  in  a  ccdd command will be corrected.  The errors
                      checked for are transposed characters, a missing charac-
                      ter,  and  one  character  too many.  If a correction is
                      found, the corrected filename is printed, and  the  com-
                      mand  proceeds.  This option is only used by interactive
                      shells.
              cchheecckkhhaasshh
                      If set, bbaasshh checks that a command found in the hash ta-
                      ble  exists  before  trying  to execute it.  If a hashed
                      command no longer exists, a normal path search  is  per-
                      formed.
              cchheecckkjjoobbss
                      If set, bbaasshh lists the status of any stopped and running
                      jobs before exiting an interactive shell.  If  any  jobs
                      are running, this causes the exit to be deferred until a
                      second exit is attempted without an intervening  command
                      (see JJOOBB CCOONNTTRROOLL above).  The shell always postpones ex-
                      iting if any jobs are stopped.
              cchheecckkwwiinnssiizzee
                      If set, bbaasshh checks the window size after each  external
                      (non-builtin)  command  and,  if  necessary, updates the
                      values of LLIINNEESS and CCOOLLUUMMNNSS.  This option is enabled  by
                      default.
              ccmmddhhiisstt If  set,  bbaasshh attempts to save all lines of a multiple-
                      line command in the same  history  entry.   This  allows
                      easy  re-editing of multi-line commands.  This option is
                      enabled by default, but only has an  effect  if  command
                      history is enabled, as described above under HHIISSTTOORRYY.

                      These  control aspects of the shell's compatibility mode
                      (see SSHHEELLLL CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY MMOODDEE below).

              ccoommpplleettee__ffuullllqquuoottee
                      If set, bbaasshh quotes all shell  metacharacters  in  file-
                      names  and  directory  names when performing completion.
                      If not set, bbaasshh removes metacharacters such as the dol-
                      lar  sign from the set of characters that will be quoted
                      in completed filenames when these metacharacters  appear
                      in  shell  variable references in words to be completed.
                      This means that dollar signs in variable names that  ex-
                      pand  to  directories  will  not be quoted; however, any
                      dollar signs appearing in filenames will not be  quoted,
                      either.   This  is  active only when bash is using back-
                      slashes to quote completed filenames.  This variable  is
                      set  by  default,  which is the default bash behavior in
                      versions through 4.2.

              ddiirreexxppaanndd
                      If set, bbaasshh replaces directory names with  the  results
                      of  word  expansion when performing filename completion.
                      This changes the contents of the readline  editing  buf-
                      fer.   If  not  set,  bbaasshh attempts to preserve what the
                      user typed.

              ddiirrssppeellll
                      If set, bbaasshh attempts spelling correction  on  directory
                      names  during word completion if the directory name ini-
                      tially supplied does not exist.

              ddoottgglloobb If set, bbaasshh includes filenames beginning with a `.'  in
                      the  results of pathname expansion.  The filenames ````..''''
                      and ````....''''  must always be matched explicitly,  even  if
                      ddoottgglloobb is set.

              eexxeeccffaaiill
                      If set, a non-interactive shell will not exit if it can-
                      not execute the file specified as  an  argument  to  the
                      eexxeecc  builtin  command.   An  interactive shell does not
                      exit if eexxeecc fails.

              eexxppaanndd__aalliiaasseess
                      If set, aliases are expanded as  described  above  under
                      AALLIIAASSEESS.  This option is enabled by default for interac-
                      tive shells.

              eexxttddeebbuugg
                      If set at shell invocation, or in a shell startup  file,
                      arrange to execute the debugger profile before the shell
                      starts, identical to the ----ddeebbuuggggeerr option.  If set  af-
                      ter  invocation,  behavior intended for use by debuggers
                      is enabled:

                      11..     The --FF option to the ddeeccllaarree builtin displays the
                             source file name and line number corresponding to
                             each function name supplied as an argument.

                      22..     If the command run by the DDEEBBUUGG  trap  returns  a
                             non-zero  value,  the next command is skipped and
                             not executed.

                      33..     If the command run by the DDEEBBUUGG  trap  returns  a
                             value  of 2, and the shell is executing in a sub-
                             routine (a shell function or a shell script  exe-
                             cuted  by  the  ..  or ssoouurrccee builtins), the shell
                             simulates a call to rreettuurrnn.

                      44..     BBAASSHH__AARRGGCC and BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV are updated as  described
                             in their descriptions above).

                      55..     Function  tracing  is  enabled: command substitu-
                             tion, shell functions, and subshells invoked with
                             (( _c_o_m_m_a_n_d )) inherit the DDEEBBUUGG and RREETTUURRNN traps.

                      66..     Error  tracing  is enabled: command substitution,
                             shell functions, and  subshells  invoked  with  ((
                             _c_o_m_m_a_n_d )) inherit the EERRRR trap.

              eexxttgglloobb If set, the extended pattern matching features described
                      above under PPaatthhnnaammee EExxppaannssiioonn are enabled.

              eexxttqquuoottee
                      If set, $$'_s_t_r_i_n_g' and  $$"_s_t_r_i_n_g"  quoting  is  performed
                      within   $${{_p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r}}   expansions  enclosed  in  double
                      quotes.  This option is enabled by default.

              ffaaiillgglloobb
                      If set, patterns which fail to  match  filenames  during
                      pathname expansion result in an expansion error.

              ffoorrccee__ffiiggnnoorree
                      If  set,  the  suffixes  specified  by the FFIIGGNNOORREE shell
                      variable cause words to be ignored when performing  word
                      completion even if the ignored words are the only possi-
                      ble completions.  See SSHHEELLLL VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS above  for  a  de-
                      scription  of  FFIIGGNNOORREE.   This  option is enabled by de-
                      fault.

              gglloobbaasscciiiirraannggeess
                      If set,  range  expressions  used  in  pattern  matching
                      bracket  expressions (see PPaatttteerrnn MMaattcchhiinngg above) behave
                      as if in the traditional C locale when  performing  com-
                      parisons.   That  is, the current locale's collating se-
                      quence is not taken into account, so bb will not  collate
                      between  AA  and  BB,  and upper-case and lower-case ASCII
                      characters will collate together.

              gglloobbsskkiippddoottss
                      If set, pathname expansion will never  match  the  file-
                      names ````..''''  and ````....'''', even if the pattern begins with
                      a ````..''''.  This option is enabled by default.

              gglloobbssttaarr
                      If set, the pattern **** used in a pathname expansion con-
                      text  will  match all files and zero or more directories
                      and subdirectories.  If the pattern is followed by a  //,
                      only directories and subdirectories match.

              ggnnuu__eerrrrffmmtt
                      If set, shell error messages are written in the standard
                      GNU error message format.

              hhiissttaappppeenndd
                      If set, the history list is appended to the  file  named
                      by the value of the HHIISSTTFFIILLEE variable when the shell ex-
                      its, rather than overwriting the file.

              hhiissttrreeeeddiitt
                      If set, and rreeaaddlliinnee is being used, a user is given  the
                      opportunity to re-edit a failed history substitution.

              hhiissttvveerriiffyy
                      If  set, and rreeaaddlliinnee is being used, the results of his-
                      tory substitution are  not  immediately  passed  to  the
                      shell  parser.   Instead,  the  resulting line is loaded
                      into the rreeaaddlliinnee editing buffer, allowing further modi-
                      fication.

              hhoossttccoommpplleettee
                      If set, and rreeaaddlliinnee is being used, bbaasshh will attempt to
                      perform hostname completion when a word containing  a  @@
                      is   being  completed  (see  CCoommpplleettiinngg  under  RREEAADDLLIINNEE
                      above).  This is enabled by default.

              hhuuppoonneexxiitt
                      If set, bbaasshh will send SSIIGGHHUUPP to all jobs when an inter-
                      active login shell exits.

              iinnhheerriitt__eerrrreexxiitt
                      If  set,  command substitution inherits the value of the
                      eerrrreexxiitt option, instead of unsetting it in the  subshell
                      environment.   This option is enabled when _p_o_s_i_x _m_o_d_e is
                      enabled.

              iinntteerraaccttiivvee__ccoommmmeennttss
                      If set, allow a word beginning with ## to cause that word
                      and  all remaining characters on that line to be ignored
                      in an interactive shell (see CCOOMMMMEENNTTSS above).  This  op-
                      tion is enabled by default.

              llaassttppiippee
                      If  set,  and  job control is not active, the shell runs
                      the last command of a pipeline not executed in the back-
                      ground in the current shell environment.

              lliitthhiisstt If  set,  and  the ccmmddhhiisstt option is enabled, multi-line
                      commands are saved to the history with embedded newlines
                      rather than using semicolon separators where possible.

              llooccaallvvaarr__iinnhheerriitt
                      If set, local variables inherit the value and attributes
                      of a variable of the same name that exists at a previous
                      scope before any new value is assigned.  The nameref at-
                      tribute is not inherited.

              llooccaallvvaarr__uunnsseett
                      If set, calling uunnsseett on  local  variables  in  previous
                      function  scopes  marks  them so subsequent lookups find
                      them unset until that function returns. This is  identi-
                      cal  to the behavior of unsetting local variables at the
                      current function scope.

              llooggiinn__sshheellll
                      The shell sets this option if it is started as  a  login
                      shell  (see  IINNVVOOCCAATTIIOONN  above).   The  value may not be
                      changed.

              mmaaiillwwaarrnn
                      If set, and a file that bbaasshh is checking  for  mail  has
                      been  accessed  since  the last time it was checked, the
                      message ``The mail in _m_a_i_l_f_i_l_e has been read''  is  dis-
                      played.

                      If  set,  and  rreeaaddlliinnee is being used, bbaasshh will not at-
                      tempt to search the PPAATTHH for possible  completions  when
                      completion is attempted on an empty line.

              nnooccaasseegglloobb
                      If  set,  bbaasshh  matches  filenames in a case-insensitive
                      fashion when performing pathname expansion (see PPaatthhnnaammee
                      EExxppaannssiioonn above).

              nnooccaasseemmaattcchh
                      If  set,  bbaasshh  matches  patterns  in a case-insensitive
                      fashion when performing matching while executing ccaassee or
                      [[[[ conditional commands, when performing pattern substi-
                      tution word expansions, or when filtering possible  com-
                      pletions as part of programmable completion.

              nnooeexxppaanndd__ttrraannssllaattiioonn
                      If  set,  bbaasshh encloses the translated results of $"..."
                      quoting in single quotes instead of double  quotes.   If
                      the string is not translated, this has no effect.

              nnuullllgglloobb
                      If  set,  bbaasshh allows patterns which match no files (see
                      PPaatthhnnaammee EExxppaannssiioonn above) to expand to  a  null  string,
                      rather than themselves.

              ppaattssuubb__rreeppllaacceemmeenntt
                      If set, bbaasshh expands occurrences of && in the replacement
                      string of pattern substitution to the  text  matched  by
                      the  pattern,  as  described  under  PPaarraammeetteerr EExxppaannssiioonn
                      above.  This option is enabled by default.

              pprrooggccoommpp
                      If set, the programmable completion facilities (see PPrroo--
                      ggrraammmmaabbllee CCoommpplleettiioonn above) are enabled.  This option is
                      enabled by default.

              pprrooggccoommpp__aalliiaass
                      If set, and programmable  completion  is  enabled,  bbaasshh
                      treats  a command name that doesn't have any completions
                      as a possible alias and attempts alias expansion. If  it
                      has  an alias, bbaasshh attempts programmable completion us-
                      ing the command word resulting from the expanded alias.

              pprroommppttvvaarrss
                      If set, prompt strings undergo parameter expansion, com-
                      mand  substitution,  arithmetic expansion, and quote re-
                      moval after being expanded  as  described  in  PPRROOMMPPTTIINNGG
                      above.  This option is enabled by default.

              rreessttrriicctteedd__sshheellll
                      The  shell  sets  this  option  if  it is started in re-
                      stricted mode (see RREESSTTRRIICCTTEEDD SSHHEELLLL below).   The  value
                      may  not be changed.  This is not reset when the startup
                      files are executed, allowing the startup files  to  dis-
                      cover whether or not a shell is restricted.

              sshhiifftt__vveerrbboossee
                      If  set,  the sshhiifftt builtin prints an error message when
                      the shift count exceeds the number of positional parame-
                      ters.

              ssoouurrcceeppaatthh
                      If set, the .. (ssoouurrccee) builtin uses the value of PPAATTHH to
                      find the directory containing the file  supplied  as  an
                      argument.  This option is enabled by default.

              vvaarrrreeddiirr__cclloossee
                      If  set, the shell automatically closes file descriptors
                      assigned using the _{_v_a_r_n_a_m_e_} redirection syntax (see RREE--
                      DDIIRREECCTTIIOONN  above)  instead of leaving them open when the
                      command completes.

              xxppgg__eecchhoo
                      If set, the eecchhoo builtin  expands  backslash-escape  se-
                      quences by default.

       ssuussppeenndd [--ff]
              Suspend  the execution of this shell until it receives a SSIIGGCCOONNTT
              signal.  A login shell, or a shell without job control  enabled,
              cannot  be suspended; the --ff option can be used to override this
              and force the suspension.  The return status  is  0  unless  the
              shell  is  a login shell or job control is not enabled and --ff is
              not supplied.

       tteesstt _e_x_p_r
       [[ _e_x_p_r ]]
              Return a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evalu-
              ation of the conditional expression _e_x_p_r.  Each operator and op-
              erand must be a separate argument.  Expressions are composed  of
              the  primaries  described  above  under CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS.
              tteesstt does not accept any options, nor does it accept and  ignore
              an argument of ---- as signifying the end of options.

              Expressions  may  be  combined  using  the  following operators,
              listed in decreasing order of precedence.   The  evaluation  de-
              pends  on  the  number of arguments; see below.  Operator prece-
              dence is used when there are five or more arguments.
              !! _e_x_p_r True if _e_x_p_r is false.
              (( _e_x_p_r ))
                     Returns the value of _e_x_p_r.  This may be used to  override
                     the normal precedence of operators.
              _e_x_p_r_1 -aa _e_x_p_r_2
                     True if both _e_x_p_r_1 and _e_x_p_r_2 are true.
              _e_x_p_r_1 -oo _e_x_p_r_2
                     True if either _e_x_p_r_1 or _e_x_p_r_2 is true.

              tteesstt and [[ evaluate conditional expressions using a set of rules
              based on the number of arguments.

              0 arguments
                     The expression is false.
              1 argument
                     The expression is true if and only if the argument is not
                     null.
              2 arguments
                     If the first argument is !!, the expression is true if and
                     only if the second argument is null.  If the first  argu-
                     ment  is  one  of  the unary conditional operators listed
                     above under CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS,  the  expression  is
                     true if the unary test is true.  If the first argument is
                     not a valid unary conditional operator, the expression is
                     false.
              3 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.
                     If the second argument is one of the  binary  conditional
                     operators listed above under CCOONNDDIITTIIOONNAALL EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONNSS, the
                     result of the expression is the result of the binary test
                     using  the first and third arguments as operands.  The --aa
                     and --oo operators are  considered  binary  operators  when
                     there  are  three arguments.  If the first argument is !!,
                     the value is the negation of the two-argument test  using
                     the second and third arguments.  If the first argument is
                     exactly (( and the third argument is exactly )), the result
                     is  the one-argument test of the second argument.  Other-
                     wise, the expression is false.
              4 arguments
                     The following conditions are applied in the order listed.
                     If the first argument is !!, the result is the negation of
                     the three-argument expression composed of  the  remaining
                     arguments.   the  two-argument  test using the second and
                     third arguments.  If the first argument is exactly ((  and
                     the  fourth argument is exactly )), the result is the two-
                     argument test of the second and third arguments.   Other-
                     wise, the expression is parsed and evaluated according to
                     precedence using the rules listed above.
              5 or more arguments
                     The expression  is  parsed  and  evaluated  according  to
                     precedence using the rules listed above.

              When  used  with  tteesstt  or [[, the << and >> operators sort lexico-
              graphically using ASCII ordering.

       ttiimmeess  Print the accumulated user and system times for  the  shell  and
              for processes run from the shell.  The return status is 0.

       ttrraapp [--llpp] [[_a_r_g] _s_i_g_s_p_e_c ...]
              The  command  _a_r_g  is to be read and executed when the shell re-
              ceives signal(s) _s_i_g_s_p_e_c.  If _a_r_g is absent (and there is a sin-
              gle  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c) or --, each specified signal is reset to its origi-
              nal disposition (the value it had upon entrance to  the  shell).
              If  _a_r_g  is the null string the signal specified by each _s_i_g_s_p_e_c
              is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes.  If  _a_r_g
              is  not present and --pp has been supplied, then the trap commands
              associated with each _s_i_g_s_p_e_c are displayed.  If no arguments are
              supplied  or  if  only --pp is given, ttrraapp prints the list of com-
              mands associated with each signal.  The  --ll  option  causes  the
              shell  to  print  a list of signal names and their corresponding
              numbers.  Each _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is either a signal name defined in  <_s_i_g_-
              _n_a_l_._h>,  or  a signal number.  Signal names are case insensitive
              and the SSIIGG prefix is optional.

              If a _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is EEXXIITT (0) the command _a_r_g  is  executed  on  exit
              from  the shell.  If a _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is DDEEBBUUGG, the command _a_r_g is exe-
              cuted before every _s_i_m_p_l_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d, _f_o_r  command,  _c_a_s_e  command,
              _s_e_l_e_c_t  command,  every  arithmetic  _f_o_r command, and before the
              first command executes in a shell function  (see  SSHHEELLLL  GGRRAAMMMMAARR
              above).   Refer to the description of the eexxttddeebbuugg option to the
              sshhoopptt builtin for details of its effect on the DDEEBBUUGG trap.  If a
              _s_i_g_s_p_e_c is RREETTUURRNN, the command _a_r_g is executed each time a shell
              function or a script executed with the .. or ssoouurrccee builtins fin-
              ishes executing.

              If  a  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  is  EERRRR,  the command _a_r_g is executed whenever a
              pipeline (which may consist of a single simple command), a list,
              or a compound command returns a non-zero exit status, subject to
              the following conditions.  The EERRRR trap is not executed  if  the
              failed command is part of the command list immediately following
              a wwhhiillee or uunnttiill keyword, part of the test in an  _i_f  statement,
              part of a command executed in a &&&& or |||| list except the command
              following the final &&&& or ||||, any command in a pipeline but  the
              last,  or  if the command's return value is being inverted using
              !!.  These are the same conditions obeyed by the eerrrreexxiitt (--ee) op-
              tion.

              Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or re-
              set.  Trapped signals that are not being ignored  are  reset  to
              their original values in a subshell or subshell environment when
              one is created.  The return status is false if  any  _s_i_g_s_p_e_c  is
              invalid; otherwise ttrraapp returns true.

       ttyyppee [--aaffttppPP] _n_a_m_e [_n_a_m_e ...]
              With  no options, indicate how each _n_a_m_e would be interpreted if
              used as a command name.  If the --tt option is used, ttyyppee prints a
              string  which  is  one  of _a_l_i_a_s, _k_e_y_w_o_r_d, _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n, _b_u_i_l_t_i_n, or
              _f_i_l_e if  _n_a_m_e  is  an  alias,  shell  reserved  word,  function,
              builtin,  or disk file, respectively.  If the _n_a_m_e is not found,
              then nothing is printed, and an exit  status  of  false  is  re-
              turned.   If the --pp option is used, ttyyppee either returns the name
              of the disk file that would be executed if _n_a_m_e  were  specified
              as  a command name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not re-
              turn _f_i_l_e.  The --PP option forces a PPAATTHH search  for  each  _n_a_m_e,
              even if ``type -t name'' would not return _f_i_l_e.  If a command is
              hashed, --pp and --PP print the hashed value, which is not necessar-
              ily  the  file  that appears first in PPAATTHH.  If the --aa option is
              used, ttyyppee prints all of the places that contain  an  executable
              named _n_a_m_e.  This includes aliases and functions, if and only if
              the --pp option is not also used.  The table of hashed commands is
              not  consulted  when  using  --aa.  The --ff option suppresses shell
              function lookup, as with the ccoommmmaanndd builtin.  ttyyppee returns true
              if all of the arguments are found, false if any are not found.

       uulliimmiitt [--HHSS] --aa
       uulliimmiitt [--HHSS] [--bbccddeeffiikkllmmnnppqqrrssttuuvvxxPPRRTT [_l_i_m_i_t]]
              Provides  control  over the resources available to the shell and
              to processes started by it, on systems that allow such  control.
              The --HH and --SS options specify that the hard or soft limit is set
              for the given resource.  A hard limit cannot be increased  by  a
              non-root  user  once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up
              to the value of the hard limit.  If neither --HH nor --SS is  speci-
              fied, both the soft and hard limits are set.  The value of _l_i_m_i_t
              can be a number in the unit specified for the resource or one of
              the special values hhaarrdd, ssoofftt, or uunnlliimmiitteedd, which stand for the
              current hard limit, the current soft limit, and  no  limit,  re-
              spectively.   If _l_i_m_i_t is omitted, the current value of the soft
              limit of the resource is printed, unless the --HH option is given.
              When  more  than  one  resource is specified, the limit name and
              unit, if appropriate, are printed before the value.   Other  op-
              tions are interpreted as follows:
              --aa     All current limits are reported; no limits are set
              --bb     The maximum socket buffer size
              --cc     The maximum size of core files created
              --dd     The maximum size of a process's data segment
              --ee     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice")
              --ff     The  maximum  size  of files written by the shell and its
                     children
              --ii     The maximum number of pending signals
              --kk     The maximum number of kqueues that may be allocated
              --ll     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
              --mm     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not  honor
                     this limit)
              --nn     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems
                     do not allow this value to be set)
              --pp     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)

              --vv     The  maximum  amount  of  virtual memory available to the

              If  _l_i_m_i_t  is given, and the --aa option is not used, _l_i_m_i_t is the
              new value of the specified resource.  If  no  option  is  given,
              then  --ff is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except
              for --tt, which is in seconds; --RR, which is in  microseconds;  --pp,
              which  is  in  units of 512-byte blocks; --PP, --TT, --bb, --kk, --nn, and
              --uu, which are unscaled values; and, when in posix mode,  --cc  and
              --ff,  which  are  in 512-byte increments.  The return status is 0
              unless an invalid option or argument is supplied,  or  an  error
              occurs while setting a new limit.

       uummaasskk [--pp] [--SS] [_m_o_d_e]
              The user file-creation mask is set to _m_o_d_e.  If _m_o_d_e begins with
              a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number; otherwise  it  is
              interpreted  as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by
              _c_h_m_o_d(1).  If _m_o_d_e is omitted, the current value of the mask  is
              printed.   The  --SS  option causes the mask to be printed in sym-
              bolic form; the default output is an octal number.   If  the  --pp
              option is supplied, and _m_o_d_e is omitted, the output is in a form
              that may be reused as input.  The return status is 0 if the mode
              was  successfully  changed  or if no _m_o_d_e argument was supplied,
              and false otherwise.

       uunnaalliiaass [-aa] [_n_a_m_e ...]
              Remove each _n_a_m_e from the list of defined  aliases.   If  --aa  is
              supplied,  all  alias definitions are removed.  The return value
              is true unless a supplied _n_a_m_e is not a defined alias.

       uunnsseett [-ffvv] [-nn] [_n_a_m_e ...]
              For each _n_a_m_e, remove the corresponding  variable  or  function.
              If the --vv option is given, each _n_a_m_e refers to a shell variable,
              and that variable is removed.  Read-only variables  may  not  be
              unset.   If  --ff  is specified, each _n_a_m_e refers to a shell func-
              tion, and the function definition is removed.  If the --nn  option
              is  supplied, and _n_a_m_e is a variable with the _n_a_m_e_r_e_f attribute,
              _n_a_m_e will be unset rather than the variable it  references.   --nn
              has  no  effect if the --ff option is supplied.  If no options are
              supplied, each _n_a_m_e refers to a variable; if there is  no  vari-
              able  by that name, a function with that name, if any, is unset.
              Each unset variable or function is removed from the  environment
              passed   to   subsequent  commands.   If  any  of  BBAASSHH__AALLIIAASSEESS,

              unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are sub-
              sequently reset.  The exit status is true unless a _n_a_m_e is read-
              only or may not be unset.

       wwaaiitt [--ffnn] [--pp _v_a_r_n_a_m_e] [_i_d _._._.]
              Wait for each specified child process and return its termination
              status.  Each _i_d may be a process ID or a job specification;  if
              a  job  spec  is given, all processes in that job's pipeline are
              waited for.  If _i_d is not given,  wwaaiitt  waits  for  all  running
              background  jobs  and the last-executed process substitution, if
              its process id is the same as $$!!, and the return status is zero.
              If  the  --nn option is supplied, wwaaiitt waits for a single job from
              the list of _i_ds or, if no _i_ds are supplied, any job, to complete
              and  returns its exit status.  If none of the supplied arguments
              is a child of the shell, or if no arguments are supplied and the
              shell  has no unwaited-for children, the exit status is 127.  If
              the --pp option is supplied, the process or job identifier of  the
              job  for  which  the  exit status is returned is assigned to the
              variable _v_a_r_n_a_m_e named by the  option  argument.   The  variable
              will  be unset initially, before any assignment.  This is useful
              only when the --nn option is supplied.  Supplying the  --ff  option,
              when  job control is enabled, forces wwaaiitt to wait for _i_d to ter-
              minate before returning its status, instead of returning when it
              changes  status.  If _i_d specifies a non-existent process or job,
              the return status is 127.  If wwaaiitt is interrupted by  a  signal,
              the  return  status will be greater than 128, as described under
              SSIIGGNNAALLSS above.  Otherwise, the return status is the exit  status
              of the last process or job waited for.

SSHHEELLLL CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY MMOODDEE
       Bash-4.0  introduced the concept of a _s_h_e_l_l _c_o_m_p_a_t_i_b_i_l_i_t_y _l_e_v_e_l, speci-
       fied as a set of options to the shopt  builtin  (  ccoommppaatt3311,  ccoommppaatt3322,
       ccoommppaatt4400,  ccoommppaatt4411, and so on).  There is only one current compatibil-
       ity level -- each option  is  mutually  exclusive.   The  compatibility
       level  is intended to allow users to select behavior from previous ver-
       sions that is incompatible  with  newer  versions  while  they  migrate
       scripts  to  use  current  features and behavior. It's intended to be a
       temporary solution.

       This section does not mention behavior that is standard for a  particu-
       lar  version  (e.g., setting ccoommppaatt3322 means that quoting the rhs of the
       regexp matching operator quotes special regexp characters in the  word,
       which is default behavior in bash-3.2 and subsequent versions).

       If  a  user enables, say, ccoommppaatt3322, it may affect the behavior of other
       compatibility levels up to  and  including  the  current  compatibility
       level.   The  idea  is  that each compatibility level controls behavior
       that changed in that version of bbaasshh, but that behavior may  have  been
       present  in  earlier versions.  For instance, the change to use locale-
       based comparisons with the [[[[ command came  in  bash-4.1,  and  earlier
       versions used ASCII-based comparisons, so enabling ccoommppaatt3322 will enable
       ASCII-based comparisons as well.  That granularity may  not  be  suffi-
       cient  for  all uses, and as a result users should employ compatibility
       levels carefully.  Read the documentation for a particular  feature  to
       find out the current behavior.

       Bash-4.3  introduced  a new shell variable: BBAASSHH__CCOOMMPPAATT.  The value as-
       signed to this variable (a decimal version number like 4.2, or an inte-
       ger  corresponding to the ccoommppaatt_N_N option, like 42) determines the com-
       patibility level.

       Starting with bash-4.4, Bash has begun deprecating older  compatibility
       levels.   Eventually, the options will be removed in favor of BBAASSHH__CCOOMM--
       PPAATT.

       Bash-5.0 is the final version for which there  will  be  an  individual
       shopt  option for the previous version. Users should use BBAASSHH__CCOOMMPPAATT on
       bash-5.0 and later versions.

       The following table describes the behavior changes controlled  by  each
       compatibility level setting.  The ccoommppaatt_N_N tag is used as shorthand for
       setting the compatibility level to _N_N using one of the following mecha-
       nisms.   For versions prior to bash-5.0, the compatibility level may be
       set using the corresponding ccoommppaatt_N_N shopt option.   For  bash-4.3  and
       later  versions,  the  BBAASSHH__CCOOMMPPAATT variable is preferred, and it is re-
       quired for bash-5.1 and later versions.

       ccoommppaatt3311
              +o      quoting the rhs of the [[[[ command's regexp matching oper-
                     ator (=~) has no special effect

       ccoommppaatt3322
              +o      interrupting  a  command  list such as "a ; b ; c" causes
                     the execution  of  the  next  command  in  the  list  (in
                     bash-4.0  and later versions, the shell acts as if it re-
                     ceived the interrupt, so interrupting one  command  in  a
                     list aborts the execution of the entire list)

       ccoommppaatt4400
              +o      the  <<  and >> operators to the [[[[ command do not consider
                     the current locale when comparing strings; they use ASCII
                     ordering.  Bash versions prior to bash-4.1 use ASCII col-
                     lation and _s_t_r_c_m_p(3); bash-4.1 and later use the  current
                     locale's collation sequence and _s_t_r_c_o_l_l(3).

       ccoommppaatt4411
              +o      in  _p_o_s_i_x mode, ttiimmee may be followed by options and still
                     be recognized as a reserved word (this is POSIX interpre-
                     tation 267)
              +o      in _p_o_s_i_x mode, the parser requires that an even number of
                     single quotes occur in the  _w_o_r_d  portion  of  a  double-
                     quoted  parameter expansion and treats them specially, so
                     that characters within the single quotes  are  considered
                     quoted (this is POSIX interpretation 221)

       ccoommppaatt4422
              +o      the replacement string in double-quoted pattern substitu-
                     tion does not undergo quote removal, as it does  in  ver-
                     sions after bash-4.2
              +o      in  posix mode, single quotes are considered special when
                     expanding the _w_o_r_d portion of a  double-quoted  parameter
                     expansion  and  can  be  used to quote a closing brace or
                     other special character (this is part of POSIX  interpre-
                     tation  221);  in  later  versions, single quotes are not
                     special within double-quoted word expansions

       ccoommppaatt4433
              +o      the shell does not print a warning message if an  attempt
                     is  made  to use a quoted compound assignment as an argu-
                     ment to declare (e.g., declare  -a  foo='(1  2)').  Later
                     versions warn that this usage is deprecated
              +o      word  expansion  errors  are  considered non-fatal errors
                     that cause the current command to  fail,  even  in  posix
                     mode  (the  default behavior is to make them fatal errors
                     that cause the shell to exit)
              +o      when  executing  a  shell  function,   the   loop   state
                     (while/until/etc.)  is not reset, so bbrreeaakk or ccoonnttiinnuuee in
                     that function will break or continue loops in the calling
                     context.  Bash-4.4 and later reset the loop state to pre-
                     vent this

       ccoommppaatt4444
              +o      the shell sets  up  the  values  used  by  BBAASSHH__AARRGGVV  and
                     BBAASSHH__AARRGGCC  so  they  can expand to the shell's positional
                     parameters even if extended debugging mode is not enabled
              +o      a subshell inherits loops from  its  parent  context,  so
                     bbrreeaakk  or  ccoonnttiinnuuee  will  cause  the  subshell  to exit.
                     Bash-5.0 and later reset the loop state  to  prevent  the
                     exit
              +o      variable  assignments  preceding builtins like eexxppoorrtt and
                     rreeaaddoonnllyy that set attributes continue to affect variables
                     with the same name in the calling environment even if the
                     shell is not in posix mode

       ccoommppaatt5500
              +o      Bash-5.1 changed the way $$RRAANNDDOOMM is generated  to  intro-
                     duce slightly more randomness. If the shell compatibility
                     level is set to 50 or lower, it  reverts  to  the  method
                     from  bash-5.0 and previous versions, so seeding the ran-
                     dom number generator by assigning a value to RRAANNDDOOMM  will
                     produce the same sequence as in bash-5.0
              +o      If  the  command hash table is empty, bash versions prior
                     to bash-5.1 printed an informational message to that  ef-
                     fect,  even  when  producing output that can be reused as
                     input. Bash-5.1 suppresses that message when the  --ll  op-
                     tion is supplied.

       ccoommppaatt5511
              +o      The  uunnsseett  builtin  treats  attempts to unset array sub-
                     scripts @@ and ** differently depending on whether the  ar-
                     ray  is  indexed  or associative, and differently than in
                     previous versions.

       If bbaasshh is started with the name rrbbaasshh, or the --rr option is supplied at
       invocation,  the  shell becomes restricted.  A restricted shell is used
       to set up an environment more controlled than the standard  shell.   It
       behaves  identically  to bbaasshh with the exception that the following are
       disallowed or not performed:

       +o      changing directories with ccdd

       +o      setting or unsetting the values of SSHHEELLLL, PPAATTHH,  HHIISSTTFFIILLEE,  EENNVV,
              or BBAASSHH__EENNVV

       +o      specifying command names containing //

       +o      importing function definitions from  the  shell  environment  at

       +o      parsing  the  value  of  SSHHEELLLLOOPPTTSS from the shell environment at

BBUUGG RREEPPOORRTTSS
       If you find a bug in bbaasshh,, you should report it.  But first, you should
       make  sure  that  it really is a bug, and that it appears in the latest
       version  of  bbaasshh.   The  latest  version  is  always  available   from
       _f_t_p_:_/_/_f_t_p_._g_n_u_._o_r_g_/_p_u_b_/_g_n_u_/_b_a_s_h_/          and          _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_g_i_t_._s_a_v_a_n_-
       _n_a_h_._g_n_u_._o_r_g_/_c_g_i_t_/_b_a_s_h_._g_i_t_/_s_n_a_p_s_h_o_t_/_b_a_s_h_-_m_a_s_t_e_r_._t_a_r_._g_z.

       Once you have determined that a bug actually exists,  use  the  _b_a_s_h_b_u_g
       command  to submit a bug report.  If you have a fix, you are encouraged
       to mail that as well!  Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports  may
       be  mailed  to  _b_u_g_-_b_a_s_h_@_g_n_u_._o_r_g  or  posted  to  the  Usenet newsgroup
       ggnnuu..bbaasshh..bbuugg.

       ALL bug reports should include:

       The version number of bbaasshh
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug

       _b_a_s_h_b_u_g inserts the first three items automatically into  the  template
       it provides for filing a bug report.

       Comments and bug reports concerning this manual page should be directed
       to _c_h_e_t_._r_a_m_e_y_@_c_a_s_e_._e_d_u.

BBUUGGSS
       It's too big and too slow.

       There are some subtle differences between bbaasshh and traditional versions
       of sshh, mostly because of the PPOOSSIIXX specification.

       Aliases are confusing in some uses.

       Shell builtin commands and functions are not stoppable/restartable.

       Compound commands and command sequences of the form `a ; b ; c' are not
       handled gracefully  when  process  suspension  is  attempted.   When  a
       process  is stopped, the shell immediately executes the next command in
       the sequence.  It suffices to place the sequence  of  commands  between
       parentheses  to  force  it  into  a subshell, which may be stopped as a
       unit.

       Array variables may not (yet) be exported.

       There may be only one active coprocess at a time.
