$BUILTIN let
$FUNCTION let_builtin
$PRODUCES let.c
$SHORT_DOC let arg [arg ...]
Evaluate arithmetic expressions.

Evaluate each ARG as an arithmetic expression.  Evaluation is done in
fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0
is trapped and flagged as an error.  The following list of operators is
grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators.  The levels are listed
in order of decreasing precedence.

	id++, id--	variable post-increment, post-decrement
	++id, --id	variable pre-increment, pre-decrement
	-, +		unary minus, plus
	!, ~		logical and bitwise negation
	**		exponentiation
	*, /, %		multiplication, division, remainder
	+, -		addition, subtraction
	<<, >>		left and right bitwise shifts
	<=, >=, <, >	comparison
	==, !=		equality, inequality
	&		bitwise AND
	^		bitwise XOR
	|		bitwise OR
	&&		logical AND
	||		logical OR
	expr ? expr : expr
			conditional operator
	=, *=, /=, %=,
	+=, -=, <<=, >>=,
	&=, ^=, |=	assignment

Shell variables are allowed as operands.  The name of the variable
is replaced by its value (coerced to a fixed-width integer) within
an expression.  The variable need not have its integer attribute
turned on to be used in an expression.

Operators are evaluated in order of precedence.  Sub-expressions in
parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence
rules above.

Exit Status:
If the last ARG evaluates to 0, let returns 1; let returns 0 otherwise.
