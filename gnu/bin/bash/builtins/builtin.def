$BUILTIN builtin
$FUNCTION builtin_builtin
$SHORT_DOC builtin [shell-builtin [arg ...]]
Execute shell builtins.

Execute SHELL-BUILTIN with arguments ARGs without performing command
lookup.  This is useful when you wish to reimplement a shell builtin
as a shell function, but need to execute the builtin within the function.

Exit Status:
Returns the exit status of SHELL-BUILTIN, or false if SHELL-BUILTIN is
not a shell builtin.
