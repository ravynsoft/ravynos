				 ---------

[bash-5.1 released]

				   12/7
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- bashline.o: add dependency on ${DEFDIR}/builtext.h. Report from
	  Fazal Majid <fazal@majid.org>

				   12/11
				   -----
builtins/wait.def
	- wait_builtin: don't assign the variable given with -p if there are no
	  jobs to wait for. Report and fix from Oƒuz <oguzismailuysal@gmail.com>

arrayfunc.c
	- kvpair_assignment_p: return non-zero if argument L appears to be a
	  key-value pair associative array compound assignment
	- expand_and_quote_kvpair_word: run a single word in a key-value pair
	  associative array compound assignment through the appropriate
	  expansions and single-quote the result

arrayfunc.h
	- kvpair_assignment_p, expand_and_quote_kvpair_word: extern declarations

subst.c
	- expand_oneword: detect whether VALUE appears to be a key-value
	  pair compound assignment and call the appropriate function to expand
	  each word in the resulting list. Fixes inconsistency reported by
	  oguzismailuysal@gmail.com

				   12/12
				   -----
subst.c
	- command_substitute: don't reset pipeline_pgrp to shell_pgrp if we
	  are already forked to run a command (SUBSHELL_FORK). Fixes SIGINT
	  in command substitution in here-document in forked child issue
	  reported by oguzismailuysal@gmail.com

				   12/18
				   -----
execute_cmd.c
	- execute_pipeline: execute the lastpipe code even if prev == 0. It
	  can only be 0 here if stdin was closed when this function was
	  executed
	- execute_pipeline: if prev == 0, set lstdin to a sentinel (-1) that
	  means to close fd 0 after executing the command, and call close(prev)
	  before restoring stdin. restore_stdin now understands -1, and closes
	  fd 0. Fixes issue reported by Tomas Janousek <tomi@nomi.cz>

				   12/21
				   -----
doc/bashref.texi
	- PROMPT_COMMANDS: clean up a couple of remaining instances of this
	  name. Report from Eli Schwartz <eschwartz@archlinux.org>

				   12/26
				   -----
subst.c
	- command_substitute: make sure that the child process always has
	  pipeline_pgrp == shell_pgrp: if pipeline_pgrp is non-zero when we
	  get to the child, meaning that we're part of an already-forked
	  child that is, for instance, running redirections, we need to reset
	  shell_pgrp to it to preserve the invariant. Fixes bug with terminal
	  being set to the incorrect pgrp reported by oguzismailuysal@gmail.com

				   12/29
				   -----
configure.ac,builtins/shobj-conf,m4/threadlib.m4
	- midnightbsd: update auto-configuration to treat MidnightBSD like
	  FreeBSD. From https://savannah.gnu.org/patch/?10006

				   12/30
				   -----
examples/loadables/stat.c
	- stattime: use strftime with a default format or the format supplied
	  with the -F option to format the file time information
	- stat_builtin: now takes a -F fmt option for a strftime format string;
	  change to function calling sequences to pass the format down to
	  stattime

examples/loadables/Makefile.in
	- stat: now built and installed by default

				   12/31
				   -----
command.h
	- SUBSHELL_IGNTRAP: new flag value

jobs.c
	- make_child: set SUBSHELL_IGNTRAP in subshell_environment in the
	  child process, meaning that we should not execute trap handlers for
	  trapped signals

execute_cmd.c
	- execute_in_subshell, execute_simple_command, execute_disk_command:
	  make sure to unset SUBSHELL_IGNTRAP after a child process restores
	  the original signal dispositions
	- execute_simple_command: make sure to set SUBSHELL_IGNTRAP after
	  make_child returns and we're setting subshell_environment directly

subst.c
	- command_substitute,process_substitute: unset SUBSHELL_IGNTRAP after
	  the child process has reset the trapped signal dispositions

trap.c
	- trap_handler: if we get a signal for which we have set a trap, but
	  SUBSHELL_IGNTRAP is set in subshell_environmnent, make sure we
	  restore the original signal disposition and resend the signal to
	  ourselves. Fixes issue reported by Nikolay Borisov <nborisov@suse.com>
	  (or at least makes the race window much smaller)

sig.c
	- initialize_terminating_signal: set the original signal handler from
	  the return value from sigaction; a minor optimization that saves a
	  system call or two

				 1/5/2021
				 --------
builtins/declare.def
	- declare_internal: make some option combinations that don't make
	  sense errors (e.g., -f and -a/-A/-i/-n)
	- declare_internal: if we build a new variable name by expanding the
	  value of a nameref variable, make sure to chop the `+' in a `+='
	  off before going on

				    1/7
				    ---
doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- bind: add an example to the synopsis making it clear that you can
	  use any readline command line as a non-option argument, as it says
	  in the text. From a report from Dan Jacobson <jidanni@jidanni.org>

				   1/12
				   ----
locale.c
	- local_shiftstates -> locale_shiftsates in the non-multibyte code
	  branch. Reported by Henry Bent <henry.r.bent@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- expand_compound_assignment_word: make sure to call dispose_words on
	  the WORD_LIST * returned from expand_oneword after turning it back
	  into a string. Fixes memory leak reported by Alexander Mescheryakov
	  <alexander.s.m@gmail.com>

				   1/13
				   ----
variables.c
	- bind_variable_internal: when performing an assignment to a subscripted
	  array variable that was the value of a nameref (used in the original
	  assignment), don't call make_variable_value on the value, since that
	  messes up +=. Just call assign_array_element and let that take care
	  of calling make_variable_value appropriately. Fixes bug reported by
	  Oguz <oguzismailuysal@gmail.com>

				   1/14
				   ----
findcmd.c
	- search_for_command: if `checkhash' is set, don't add non-executable
	  files to the command hash table, since we will just remove them
	  later

lib/sh/winsize.c
	- get_new_window_size: set *rp and *cp even if READLINE is not defined

				   1/15
				   ----
lib/sh/winsize.c
	- get_new_window_size: call rl_set_window_size only if we can determine
	  we're using readline: an interactive shell without no-line-editing,
	  or if we've already initialized readline, presumably in a non-
	  interactive shell 

support/Makefile.in
	- man2html: add LDFLAGS_FOR_BUILD to the recipe. Report from
	  Jeffrey Walton <noloader@gmail.com>

				   1/17
				   ----
lib/readline/misc.c
	- rl_operate_and_get_next: fix old K&R function declaration. Report
	  from Tom Tromey <tom@tromey.com>

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_internal_char_cleanup: move code that cleans up the active region
	  and deactivates the mark inside this function so callback mode
	  applications get the intended functionality. Report and fix from
	  sparrowhawk996@gmail.com

lib/readline/bind.c
	- rl_parse_and_bind: when using the arithmetic comparison operators on
	  the version, make sure to invert the tests so that we stop parsing
	  if the test fails. Report and fix from Tom Tromey <tom@tromey.com>

				   1/19
				   ----
Makefile.in
	- pipesize.h: add dependency on ${BUILTINS_LIBRARY} to avoid parallel
	  makes trying to create it twice. Report and fix from
	  Richard Purdie <richard.purdie@linuxfoundation.org>

				   1/21
				   ----
subst.c
	- param_expand: if a nameref expands to array[@] or array[*], make sure
	  to call chk_atstar so the right variables are set to split the
	  result. Report from Oguz <oguzismailuysal@gmail.com>

				   1/22
				   ----
builtins/declare.def
	- Rewrote to reduce complexity. Still needs some work.

lib/readline/*.h, lib/tilde/tilde.h
	- PARAMS: remove, rely on compilers understanding function prototypes

lib/readline/{undo.c,histlib.h}
	 - _hs_replace_history_data: move extern declaration to histlib.h

lib/readline/readline.c
	- _rl_parse_colors: instead of an extern declaration for this, include
	  "parse-colors.h" for it

lib/readline/{histfile.c,histlib.h}
	- _hs_append_history_line: move extern declaration to histlib.h

lib/readline/history.h
	- HS_HISTORY_VERSION: define to 0x0801 (current library version) if
	  it's not already defined. We conditionally define it in case an
	  application has (unwisely) chosen to use it, since the history
	  library doesn't do anything with it yet

lib/readine/{rlprivate.h,{search,misc,readline}.c}
	- _rl_free_history_entry: add extern declaration to rlprivate.h, remove
	  extern declaration from c source files. Use HS_HISTORY_VERSION as a
	  sentinel that it's ok to use HIST_ENTRY in rlprivate.h

lib/readline/{rlprivate.h,{isearch,search,undo}.c}
	- _rl_saved_line_for_history: add extern declaration to rlprivate.h,
	  remove extern declaration from c source files, using HS_HISTORY_VERSION
	  in the same way

				   1/24
				   ----
lib/readline/signals.c
	- _rl_handle_signal: make sure that all sigprocmask calls are protected
	  by HAVE_POSIX_SIGNALS. Report and fix from Tom Tromey <tom@tromey.com>

				   1/26
				   ----
lib/readline/callback.c
	- rl_callback_read_char: make sure rl_linefunc is non-NULL before
	  calling through the pointer. The line function could have been
	  removed by the application before readline processes any typeahead
	  input. Bug reported by Matthias Klose <doko@debian.org>, pointer
	  to root cause from Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

lib/glob/glob.c
	- skipname,wskipname: put in some additional checks for `.' to ensure
	  that we don't get false positives (or incomplete tests) that can 
	  affect the results of extglob patterns. Reported by
	  gregrwm <rhn-users@greatlakedata.com>

				   1/27
				   ----
lib/glob/glob.c
	- extglob_skipname,wextglob_skipname: fixed an off-by-one error (SE
	  was being set to one character before the end of the pattern string,
	  not the null character at the end of the pattern string like other
	  callers of glob_patscan) that caused the last character of the last
	  subpattern to be cut off when calling skipname
	- extglob_skipname,wextglob_skipname: some cleanups so the code is
	  closer to identical for the single-byte and wide character versions

				    2/1
				    ---
execute_cmd.c
	- execute_simple_command: in posix mode, if we have a variable
	  assignment error while assigning into the temporary environment (e.g.,
	  assigning to a readonly variable), a non-interactive shell running a
	  special builtin exits; a non-interactive shell running anything else
	  jumps back to the top level. A shell compiled with -DSTRICT_POSIX
	  exits unconditionally.
	- execute_simple_command: make sure posix mode sets $? to non-zero
	  if a variable assignment error occurs preceding a non-special builtin

subst.c
	- do_assignment_statements: take the code from expand_word_list_internal
	  that performs assignment statements, either standalone or preceding 
	  simple command names, and factor it out into this function
	- expand_word_list_internal: call do_assignment_statements where
	  appropriate

				    2/2
				    ---
lib/glob/glob.c
	- dequote_pathname: fix function definition for non-multibyte systems.
	  Report and fix from Marc Aur√®le La France <tsi@tuyoix.net>

Makefile.in,doc/Makefile.in
	- for certain targets, remove files before creating them to deal with
	  symlinked build trees.
	  Report and fix from Marc Aur√®le La France <tsi@tuyoix.net>

examples/loadables/accept.c
	- include limits.h before typemax.h
	  Report and fix from Marc Aur√®le La France <tsi@tuyoix.net>

builtins/gen-helpfiles.c
	- if USING_BASH_MALLOC is defined, make sure to undefine malloc as well
	  as free. Fixes bug reported by George R Goffe <grgoffe@yahoo.com>

builtins/Makefile.in
	- install-help: now depends on $(HELPFILES_TARGET) so we make sure the
	  separate helpfiles are created before we try to install them if we
	  don't go through the `all' makefile target

configure.ac
	- HELPDIR: now ${datadir}/bash/helpfiles

				    2/3
				    ---
parse.y
	- parse_string_to_word_list: before expanding a compound assignment
	  statement body, make sure to save any alias that's currently being
	  expanded. Restore the alias after the compound assignment is parsed.
	  Reported back in 11/2020 by Alex fxmbsw7 Ratchev <fxmbsw7@gmail.com>

				    2/4
				    ---
lib/readline/histexpand.c
	- history_expand_internal: when calling the history_inhibit_expansion
	  function, make sure to call it using the string as we've expanded it
	  to that point (RESULT), adding the expansion and next characters
	  temporarily, since we make expansion decisions based on what we've
	  accumulated, not what we started with. This makes things like
	  echo abc!$!$ work, where before the second `!' inhibited expansion
	  because bash_history_inhibit_expansion mistakenly took it as the
	  second character in a `$!' word expansion. Fixes bug reported back
	  in 10/2020 by Paul Fox <paul.d.fox@gmail.com>

array.h
	- array_pop: instead of calling array_dispose_element from this macro,
	  just call array_shift with the AS_DISPOSE flag

				    2/5
				    ---
bashhist.c
	- shell_comment: move condition to return 0 if the delimiter stack is
	  not empty or the shell is parsing a here document into the function
	  itself, don't have the callers check so the check is in one place.
	  Fixes bug reported by Oguz <oguzismailuysal@gmail.com>

array.h,variables.c
	- ARRAY_ELEMENT_REPLACE: convenience define for modifying an array
	  element's value

variables.c
	- pop_args: a couple of code simplifications

				    2/7
				    ---
lib/malloc/malloc.c
	- pagesz: at least MALLOC_PAGESIZE_MIN (4096) bytes
	- union mhead: now 16-byte aligned on all systems, 32-bit and 64-bit
	  pointers
	- binsizes: since the smallest allocation overhead is now 16 bytes,
	  redo the buckets so binsizes[0] == 32; adjust the thresholds for
	  split/coalesce/prepopulate/mmap (NBUCKETS = 28; STARTBUCK = 0).
	  Sizes stay pretty much the same; indices change
	- consistently use MALLOC_SIZE_T instead of long/unsigned int/int
	- use MAGIC8_NUMBYTES as the length of the mh_magic8 buffer, in case
	  it changes later for alignment
	- internal_remap: new function, calls mremap to reallocate a chunk of
	  memory allocated using mmap(); called from internal_realloc if the
	  old size and new size are both bigger than the mmap threshold
	- internal_realloc: call internal_remap if the old size and new size
	  are both above the threshold where we use mmap for allocation

				   2/10
				   ----
include/timer.h
	- new file, declaration for a timer struct to be used by a set of
	  functions to implement timers using SIGALRM or select/pselect

lib/sh/timers.c
	- new file, set of functions to manipulate timer objects and timeouts
	  using SIGALRM or select/pselect. Inspired by a patch from
	  Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>. Not used yet

				   2/11
				   ----
builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: if there is a timeout set, block SIGCHLD around calls
	  to zread and its siblings, or calls to readline for `read -e', so
	  SIGCHLD (and the consequent waitpid) doesn't interrupt the read.
	  Fixes bug reported by Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>, but
	  there may be a different fix coming

Makefile.in,builtins/Makefile.in
	- fix up dependencies, especially on builtins.h and builtext.h


				   2/12
				   ----
lib/readline/input.c
	- rl_read_key: if we set rl_done == 1, set RL_STATE_DONE as well
	  Reported by Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

lib/readline/isearch.c
	- _rl_search_getchar: only call _rl_read_mbstring if rl_read_key returns
	  >= 0, avoid some work

lib/readline/vi_mode.c
	- _rl_vi_callback_change_char,_rl_vi_change_char: don't overwrite the
	  last replacement string if _rl_vi_callback_getchar returns -1.
	  It will likely make no difference, since the next read will return
	  an error or EOF, but being careful
	- rl_vi_overstrike: if _rl_overwrite_char doesn't return 0, break out
	  of the loop

lib/readline/text.c
	- _rl_overwrite_char: return 1 if _rl_read_mbstring returns < 0 so
	  we don't try to insert garbage

bashline.c
	- posix_edit_macros: handle rl_read_key() returning <= 0

				   2/15
				   ----
parse.y
	- read_comsub: make sure to turn on the LEX_RESWDOK flag if we are in
	  a case statement and read a `)', since we can get a valid `esac'.
	  Fixes bug reported by Oguz <oguzismailuysal@gmail.com>
	- read_comsub: if we're in a case statement, recognize `}' as a
	  reserved word and set the LEX_RESWDOK flag for the next word, since
	  we can get an esac (or another reserved word) after it

				   2/16
				   ----
parse.y
	- reserved_word_acceptable: add ARITH_CMD and COND_END to the list of
	  tokens that can precede a reserved word, so you can use reserved
	  words after ((...)) and [[...]].
	  Reported by Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

				   2/17
				   ----
parse.y
	- parse_comsub: use new LEX_CASEWD flag to track when we are reading
	  the WORD in `case WORD in' and turn on the LEX_RESWDOK flag when
	  that word ends. This allows $(case x in esac), which no one uses.
	- parse_comsub: use LEX_PATLIST flag to track when we are reading a
	  case pattern list so `|' doesn't turn on the LES_RESWDOK flag
	- parse_comsub: case_level: simple counter to count the number of esacs
	  we need to see before we're no longer in a case statement; analog of
	  esacs_needed_count from the lexer

				   2/19
				   ----
parse.y
	- CHECK_FOR_RESERVED_WORD: don't return ESAC if we read `esac' after a
	  left paren in a case pattern list. From an austingroup-bugs discussion
	  about https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1454
	- parse_comsub: if we read a `(' while looking for a case pattern list
	  and LEX_CKESAC is set, we have a leading left paren in the pattern
	  list and should turn off LEX_CKESAC so (esac) doesn't prematurely
	  terminate the case command. From an austingroup-bugs discussion
	  about https://www.austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1454

				   2/26
				   ----
builtins/history.def
	- history_builtin: when checking negative offsets to -d, which are
	  supposed to count back from the end of the history list, check the
	  range against 0 instead of history_base, because the calculation is
	  done against history_length, which is independent of history_base.
	  Report and fix from Christopher Gurnee <chris@gurneeconsulting.net>

doc/bashref.texi
	- replaced a number of uses of @var with a mixture of @env and @dfn
	  to better match up with the texinfo standards

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}

lib/readline/readline.c
	- rl_initialize: call _rl_timeout_init to set things up for any timeout

	- readline_internal_charloop: if we longjmped because of a timeout,
	  make sure to set rl_done/RL_STATE_DONE and return; we are
	  abandoning this call to readline(). The readline timeout changes

lib/glob/strmatch.h
	- FNM_DOTDOT: enable special handling for `.' and `..': if FNM_PERIOD

parse.y
	- parse_comsub: rewrite to recursively call the parser (yyparse()) and
	  return a string constructed from the resulting parse tree. Probably
	  will only work with bison. Error reporting is more accurate about
	  line numbers and invalid tokens, and command substitution errors 
	  are caught earlier, before expansion
	- DOLPAREN: new token, never created by yylex; only ever set by
	  parse_comsub and xparse_dolparen to indicate we're recursively
	  calling the parser for a command substitution
	- comsub: new grammar production that's triggered by DOLPAREN and
	  parses a command substitution, returning a <command>. It's one of
	  the possible end states for the top-level parser
	- grammar: only call rewind_input_string if the shell's input is
	  coming from a string
	- shell_ungets: push a string back onto the shell input; only used by
	  make_here_document for backwards compatibility -- allowing a here-
	  document to be terminated by a token at the end of a command
	  substitution
	- yylex: don't need any more special handling when returning
	  shell_eof_token, but we keep the clause for future work
	- read_token_word: don't handle backslashes (leave them in the input
	  stream) if we are reading a command substitution (PST_NOEXPAND)
	- reserved_word_acceptable: allow reserved words after DOLPAREN
	- report_syntax_error: better error handling if we hit EOF while
	  looking for the ending right paren in a command substitution
	- parse_string_to_word_list,parse_compound_assignment: make sure to
	  turn off parse_comsub sentinel temporarily

make_cmd.c
	- make_here_document: backwards compatibility: if we end a here
	  document on the same line as the end of a command substitution,
	  allow the token to terminate the here document (without requiring
	  a newline) and push the remainder of the line back for the parser
	  to consume and terminate the command substitution

builtins/evalstring.c
	- parse_string: if we read shell_eof_token and use it to terminate a

execute_cmd.c

general.c
	- check_binary_file: if the first line of the ENOEXEC file starts with

	  of running all the unwind-protects installed by the commands in
	  the string) if we're executing in a function and EXIT is trapped.

	  calling the HPUX-specific _KERNEL test only if that fails

m4/gettext.m4,configure.ac
	- AM_GNU_GETTEXT -> BASH_GNU_GETTEXT: remove deprecation warning, since

	  doesn't have a clear-to-eol sequence; make sure to add a call to
	  rl_cr after that so we know we're always in column 0
	- _rl_redisplay_after_sigwinch: just call rl_clear_visible_line instead	
	  of erasing the last line of the display
	- _rl_redisplay_after_sigwinch: if the prompt is longer than the screen
	  width, make sure to call _rl_reset_prompt to recalculate the

	  descriptor N (default 0). From a discussion back in 5/2021

				   9/27
				   ----
arrayfunc.c
	- expand_compound_array_assignment: since we run the string through
	  the parser to turn it into a list (so we can make sure all shell
	  metacharacters are properly quoted), we need to remove the CTLESC
	  the parser uses to quote CTLESC and CTLNUL in *unquoted* words.

shell.h

	  substitution; means to expand unquoted `&' in the replacement
	  STRING to the match of PATTERN

subst.c

arrayfunc.c
	- unbind_array_elememnt: pass (flags&VA_NOEXPAND) to skipsubscript(),
	  instead of unconditionally passing 1 if we're operating on an
	  associative array. This is consistent with how valid_array_reference
	  determines the length of the subscript.
	  Report and fix from Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

subst.c
	- skip_to_delim: add a new value for FLAGS. If FLAGS&2, we assume that

	  from Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

arrayfunc.c
	- unbind_array_element: make sure to pass FLAGS to skipsubscript with

	  Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>
	- array_variable_name: make sure we pass (FLAGS&1) to skipsubscript, so

	  cause an off-by-one error in subscript parsing

trap.c
	- restore_traps: inverse of reset_signal_handlers. This understands
	  how reset_signal_handlers changes the signal disposition while
	  leaving the trap string in place, and knows how to restore flags
	  and state based on that preserved trap string and whether or not
	  the signal is "special" to the shell.

builtins/exec.def
	- exec_builtin: instead of using restore_original_signals to completely
	  cancel the traps, call reset_signal_handlers so the trap strings are
	  preserved. Then if the exec fails (and we're not exiting) we can
	  look at the trap strings and see how to restore the trap state.
	  This calls restore_traps after reinitializing the shell signal
	  handlers, using the trap strings saved by reset_signal_handlers.
	  Fixes issue with not exiting after a failed exec clearing the EXIT
	  trap reported by Mark March <march@systempad.org>, using the
	  approach suggested by Robert Elz <kre@munnari.OZ.AU>

subst.c
	- expand_declaration_argument: when parsing options that modify
	  attributes that affect how the value is handled (i, c, u, etc.),
	  make sure to create an option string and call make_internal_declare
	  with options that start with a `+' so the attribute is off when
	  the assignment is performed and changes how the value is expanded.
	  From a report by L√©a Gris <lea.gris@noiraude.net>

lib/readline/complete.c
	- rl_display_match_list: even if _rl_completion_prefix_display_length
	  is set to a non-zero value, pass the common prefix length to
	  fnprint if we've turned on colored completion prefixes; passes
	  through to fnprint via print_filename
	- fnprint: add the ellipsis if prefix_bytes exceeds the
	  _rl_completion_prefix_display_length, add explicit check for
	  prefix_bytes being longer since print_filename passes it through
	  if colored-completion-prefix is set. This means that while
	  completion-prefix-display-length still has precedence over
	  colored-completion-prefix, it doesn't override it if both are set
	  and the common prefix length is shorter than
	  completion-prefix-display-length. From a report by

	  because bash-5.2 flushes an indexed array but does not unset the
	  variable when given `unset a[@]' or `unset[*]' (that is, it acts

variables.c
	- set_int_value,set_string_value: broke common code for setting int
	  and string dynamic variable values out into separate functions;
	  changed all callers to use them where appropriate. set_int_value
	  takes a flags argument saying whether or not to force the integer
	  attribute on
	- assign_random: store the value assigned as the variable value so
	  things like RANDOM=42; RANDOM+=7 generate consistent sequences
	  like in ksh93
	- assign_seconds: store the value assigned as the variable value so
	  things like SECONDS=42 ; SECONDS+=7 generate what's expected

doc/Makefile.in

arrayfunc.c
	- assign_array_element_internal: take an additional argument: char **NVALP.
	  If non-null, it gets the value eventually assigned to the array
	  element
	- assign_array_element: take an additional NVALP argument; pass it to
	  assign_array_element_internal

arrayfunc.h
	- assign_array_element: new extern function declaration

{subst,variables}.c,builtins/{common.c,declare.def}
	- assign_array_element: change callers

subst.c
	- parameter_brace_expand_rhs: for the ${param:=value}, use the value
	  returned by assign_array_element in NVALP as the return value, since
	  it's the value ultimately assigned to the variable after possible
	  modification (e.g., arithmetic evaluation). Reported by
	  oguzismailuysal@gmail.com after flawed fix applied 11/16

				   -----
arrayfunc.h
	- array_eltstate_t: an object that encapsulates an array element's
	  state (type, index, key, value) whether it's an indexed or
	  associative array

arrayfunc.c
	- {init,flush}_eltstate: new functions to initialize and flush any
	  allocated memory from array_eltstate_t objects. No allocation/
	  deallocation functions yet; the only use is with a static instance
	- assign_array_element_internal: take an array_eltstate_t * instead of
	  a char ** as the final argument, so we can return keys/indices and
	  values depending on the type of array; populates it with the
	  appropriate values
	- assign_array_element: take array_eltstate_t * as final argument
	  instead of a char **; pass it to assign_array_element_internal

{subst,variables}.c,builtins/{common.c,declare.def}
	- assign_array_element: change callers to modify final argument

				   12/15
				   -----
arrayfunc.c
	- array_value_internal: now takes an array_eltstate_t * as the final
	  argument; there is no more `rtype' argument in favor of the
	  `subtype' member; returns the appropriate values in its members
	- array_value: changed to pass array_eltstate_t to array_value_internal,
	  saves and fetches its `ind' member into *indp; saves `subtype'
	  member into *rtype
	- get_arrary_value: changed to take array_eltstate_t as third argument,
	  passes it to array_value_internal

{redir,expr}.c
	- get_array_value: changed callers; initializing the array_eltstate_t
	  argument as necessary

test.c
	- test_builtin: changed to use get_array_value, adding AV_ALLOWALL to
	  the flags, since it didn't use any QUOTED argument. Pass
	  array_eltstate_t * as final argument and get subtype from it (the
	  only thing we're interested in, to deallocate memory)

	  Callers are responsible for marshalling values into estatep

arrayfunc.h
	- array_value: changed function signature

subst.c
	- get_var_and_type,parameter_brace_expand_word: changed calls to

	  report by Robert Elz <kre@munnari.OZ.AU>

				   12/21
				   -----
subst.c
	- parameter_brace_remove_pattern,parameter_brace_patsub,parameter_brace_casemod,
	  parameter_brace_transform,parameter_brace_substring: now take an
	  array_eltstate_t * argument in place of the arrayind_t argument, pass
	  it to get_var_and_type; this generalizes the indexed array behavior
	  of expanding array subscripts once to associative arrays via an
	  eventual call to array_value_internal with a non-null KEY member
	- get_var_and_type: now takes an array_eltstate_t * argument in place
	  of the arrayind_t argument; use it in calls to array_value so we
	  can only expand array subscripts once whether they are indexed or
	  associative arrays
	- parameter_brace_expand_word: take an array_eltstate_t * argument in
	  place of the arrayind_t * argument; pass it to array_value; use a
	  static version (which we init and flush) if the argument passed is
	  NULL so we can get the right state passed back and forth
	- parameter_brace_expand: pass a pointer to a static array_eltstate_t
	  to parameter_brace_expand_word, and use that in the various calls to
	  parameter_brace_XXX functions that perform specific expansions in
	  place of the old arrayind_t argument; make sure to flush it before
	  returning, even on errors

				   12/22

{trap,variables}.c
	- internal_warning: calls changed to use translatable strings
	  consistently

error.[ch]
	- internal_debug: new function, prints a message like internal_warning,
	  no-op if DEBUG is not defined
	- INTERNAL_DEBUG: macro that expands to internal_debug when DEBUG is
	  defined, and nothing otherwise

{jobs,trap}.c
	- changed some internal_warning and internal_inform calls to use
	  internal_debug, since they were active only when DEBUG is defined

parse.y
	- parse_comsub: add internal_debug call when a command substitution
	  ends with unterminated here-documents

builtins/common.c
	- number_of_args: unconditionally return posparam_count

{jobs,execute_cmd,subst}.c,parse.y,builtins/{command.def,evalstring.c}

builtins/shopt.def
	- globskipdots: new shell option, exposes glob_always_skip_dot_and_dotdot

doc/{bash.1,bashref.texi}
	- globskipdots: document new shell option

execute_cmd.c
	- fix_arrayref_words: call valid_array_reference with 0 for third arg
	  because the words have not undergone any word expansions yet and
	  the quotes are still present. This makes things like
		A=[\[]=set
		unset A[\[]
	  work

subst.c
	- word_list_split: if a word undergoes word splitting but is not
	  changed, preserve any W_ARRAYREF flag into the new word. This makes
	  things like
		rkey=']'
		unset A[$rkey]
	  work because the unset builtin sees the W_ARRAYREF flag on its
	  argument

				   12/29
				   -----
builtins/common.h
	- SET_VFLAGS: take a set of word flags, and set flags for use with
	  valid_array_reference (vflags) and assign_array_element/bind_int_variable
	  (bindflags) based on those flags and the setting of assoc_expand_once
	  (moved from read.def and generalized)

arrayfunc.c
	- array_variable_name: now exclusively takes AV_xxx flags; understands
	  how to translate AV_NOEXPAND to the right flag for skipsubscript;
	  understands AV_ONEWORD and AV_NOEXPAND
	- array_variable_part: just passes the FLAGS arg to array_variable_name
	- assign_array_element: translates ASS_ flags to AV_ flags for
	  array_variable_name
	- array_value_internal: now just passes flags straight through to
	  array_variable_part (which sends them to array_variable_name)

builtins/common.[ch]
	- builtin_bind_var_to_int: now takes a new FLAGS third argument; passes
	  it to bind_var_to_int

builtins/printf.def
	- printf_builtin: use SET_VFLAGS to set flags for builtin_bind_variable
	  (bindflags); makes things like
		declare -A A; key=']' ; printf -v A[$key] "foo"
	  work without a subscript error as long as assoc_expand_once is defined

builtins/read.def
	- read_builtin: use new common version of SET_VFLAGS instead of
	  private version; changed to use new calling sequence; makes things like
		declare -A A; key=']' ; read A[$key] <<<"foo"
	  work without a subscript error as long as assoc_expand_once is defined

builtins/wait.def
	- wait_builtin: use SET_VFLAGS for variable name with -p option
	- wait_builtin: call builtin_bind_var_to_int with new bindflags third
	  argument

expr.c
	- expr_streval: just pass TFLAG (AV_xxx flags) straight through to
	  array_variable_part

variables.c
	- bind_int_variable: translate the assignment flags (ASS_xxx) to
	  VA_xxx flags for valid_array_reference calls (ASS_ONEWORD); translate
	  assignment flags to AV_xxx flags for array_variable_part

bashline.c
	- set_filename_quote_chars: break code that modifies
	  rl_filename_quote_characters based on whether DIRNAME needs to be
	  expanded from bash_directory_completion_hook into its own function
	- bash_check_expchar: break code that checks whether DIRNAME will be
	  word expanded from bash_directory_completion_hook into its own
	  function 
	- bashline_reset,attempt_shell_completion: make sure complete_fullquote
	  is set to 1 (as it is by default) in case a completion modifies it
	- bash_quote_filename: if we are completing (but not expanding --
	  direxpand is unset) and backslash-quoting a filename with expansion
	  characters as determined by bash_check_expchar, make sure
	  filename_bstab is set not to include the expansion char (and any
	  following char and closer) and set complete_fullquote to 0 so
	  sh_backslash_quote uses filename_bstab. Fixes the longstanding issue
	  of quoting a `$', for instance, if the rest of the filename contains
	  any characters that need quoting in filenames. This assumes that the
	  filename is unquoted (*QCP == 0) so the word will be expanded and is
	  not part of the filename (if needed, we can use file_exists to check
	  whether the expansion characters are actually part of the filename)

	  line to avoid running lines of a multi-line command together.
	  Fixes bug reported by Joakim Lindblad <joakim@cb.uu.se>

subst.c
	- expand_string_for_patsub: expand the replacement string for pattern
	  substitution assuming that it will eventually be passed to
	  strcreplace to replace `&' with the matched portion of the string.
	  This calls expand_string_for_pat(), which leaves the string quoted
	  and does not perform word splitting, then calls
	  quote_string_for_repl to post-process the expanded string.
	- quote_string_for_repl: perform quote removal on passed string while
	  replacing CTLESC escaping a `&' or a backslash with a backslash. The
	  result must be passed to strcreplace
	- parameter_brace_patsub: call expand_string_for_patsub if

jobs.[ch],nojobs.c

	  useful if no job/pid arguments are supplied and there are no jobs.
	  Reported by Oguz <oguzismailuysal@gmail.com>

builtins/read.def

	  when in posix mode, since we use read instead of zread. Fixes bug
	  reported by Andreas Schwab <schwab@linux-m68k.org>

subst.c
	- expand_string_dollar_quote: handle single-quoted and double-quoted
	  strings that might include $' and $" without attempting translation;
	  do more error checking for unterminated $' and $" that leaves those

subst.c
	- extract_dollar_brace_string: if we see another `${' on the rhs of

	- extract_heredoc_dolbrace_string: new function, variant of
	  extract_dollar_brace_string, to process the WORD in ${PARAM OP WORD}
	  while expanding lines of here-document data. It's complicated by the
	  requirement to add to the result string as we go along, since we
	  need to change the contents of the input string with ansi expansion
	  or locale translation.
	- string_extract_single_quoted: take a new third argument: ALLOWESC.

builtins/evalstring.c

	  optimize_fork if (subshell_environment & SUBSHELL_PAREN), relying
	  on fact that CMD_TRY_OPTIMIZING is only set in a couple of specific
	  conditions
	- optimize_fork: call should_suppress_fork only if startup_state == 2;
	  it does the extra checks for that specific case
	- optimize_fork: call should_optimize_fork if we're in a (list)
	  subshell (subshell_environment & SUBSHELL_PAREN)
	- optimize_subshell_command: set CMD_TRY_OPTIMIZING on the right side
	  of a `&&', `||', or `;' list as long as it's a simple command so
	  we can check with optimize_fork() when it's time to execute it

execute_cmd.c

	- parse_string_to_command: ditto

subst.c

	  only if it's marked as quoted, which prevents quotes from inside a
	  command substitution from being removed (they're supposed to begin a
	  new quoting context) when the word itself isn't flagged as quoted
	  (which means the body of the here-document gets expanded). You can't

	  austin-group discussion back in early February

lib/sh/strvis.c
	- charvis -> sh_charvis; change caller

	- show_all_var_attributes: use `local -' when printing a variable named
	  `-' at the current non-zero variable context

parse.y
	- shell_getc: if we are at the end of an alias, returning a space,
	  make sure we mark the previous character as single-byte by modifying
	  shell_input_line_property so the space we return is properly
	  recognized. This would fail before if the last character of the
	  alias was a multi-byte character. Reported by
	  Vangelis Natsios <vnatsios@gmail.com>

jobs.c
	- set_job_control: don't bother calling tcgetpgrp if shell_tty < 0,
	  since it will just fail

variables.c
	- reset_local_contexts: new function, delete all context tables
	  associated with shell functions and set variable_context to 0.
	  Called when we want to stop executing in a shell function without
	  going through the pop_context chain with its side effects

variables.h
	- reset_local_contexts: extern declaration

builtins/evalstring.c
	- parse_and_execute: call reset_local_contexts instead of setting
	  variable_context to 0

eval.c
	- reader_loop: call reset_local_contexts in cases where the shell has
	  longjmped for a fatal error and errexit is enabled (ERREXIT), but
	  not for other cases, and especially not for the exit builtin,
	  instead of just setting variable_context to 0. Fixes issue originally
	  reported by Robert Stoll <robert.stoll@tegonal.com>

subst.c
	- pat_subst: implement sed-like behavior when presented with a null
	  pattern that's anchored at the start or end of the string, or when
	  presented with a null string: process the replacement string for `&'
	  and `\&' and substitute in the result as before. Patch from
	  Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

parse.y
	- reset_parser: set need_here_doc, esacs_needed_count, expecting_in_token
	  all to 0, since jumping back to a top-level parse needs that
	- parse_comsub: make sure to reset expand_aliases and shell_eof_token
	  if we're not going to exit immediately out of this function

				   7/28
				   ----
parse.y
	- parse_comsub: if the compatibility level is <= 51, set extglob while
	  parsing the command substitution, so bad pattern errors can still be
	  caught but valid patterns are let through and can be evaluated at
	  runtime, when extglob may have been set. If it isn't set, it will
	  still be a parser error when the command substitution is executed.
	  Fixes report from Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> about gentoo scripts.
	- reset_parser: set extended_glob from global_extglob if the parser
	  state includes PST_CMDSUBST
	- xparse_dolparen: set global_extglob but don't modify extended_glob,
	  so parse errors can be caught before forking a child for command
	  substitution, as part of word expansion, but after extglob may have
	  been set by command execution (e.g., in a shell function)

trap.c
	- run_pending_traps: move code from evalstring() so we call
	  parse_and_execute() directly and handle any `return' invocations so
	  we can restore the value of running_trap. Otherwise, if we longjmp
	  past this function, we will think we're running a trap after we
	  finish. Prompted by post from Koichi Murase <myoga.murase@gmail.com>

lib/readline/nls.c
	- _rl_current_locale: private variable, stores the value of the
	  LC_CTYPE locale category, as determined by _rl_init_locale; set
	  to allocated memory in _rl_init_locale()
	- _rl_set_localevars: new function, code from _rl_init_eightbit that
	  checks the current locale (passed as an argument) and sets the
	  various locale-aware variables based on it. It accepts a second
	  argument: FORCE. If non-zero, it means to restore the default "C"
	  locale values if the locale is "C" or "POSIX", now that this
	  function can be called multiple times
	- _rl_init_eightbit: now just calls _rl_init_locale and
	  _rl_set_localevars
	- _rl_reset_locale: new function, checks whether our the locale has
	  changed since we last called _rl_init_locale to set our internal
	  idea of its value. If it has changed, call _rl_set_localevars with
	  the new locale and a FORCE argument of 1 to change the
	  locale-dependent variables.

lib/readline/rlprivate.h
	- _rl_reset_locale: extern declaration

lib/readline/readline.c
	- rl_initialize: call _rl_reset_locale instead of _rl_init_locale so
	  the internal readline variables get set when we move from a non-
	  multibyte locale ("C") to a multibyte one ("en_US.UTF-8"). Report
	  from Alan Coopersmith <alan.coopersmith@oracle.com>

lib/sh/setlinebuf.c
	- sh_setlinebuf: allocate buffers for line-buffering stdout and stderr
	  only once, the first time it is requested. Only allocate memory if
	  we're using setvbuf (we usually are). Double the buffer size to 2016
	  if we're using the bash malloc. Otherwise, let stdio handle it.

parse.y
	- parse_comsub: restore extended_glob to a local copy (local_extglob)
	  only if we changed it; a safer way to do it. Fixes extglob change
	  issue reported by Kerin Millar <kfm@plushkava.net>
	- cond_term: restore extended_glob to a local copy; safer than using
	  global_extglob, which we will reserve for error recovery

parse.y
	- parse_comsub: don't clear the pushed string list; we might need it to
	  consume additional input to satisfy this command substitution. When
	  we restore the parser state, don't restore the pushed string list in
	  case we used it. From
	  https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1018727
	- parse_comsub: don't modify extended_glob if parser_state includes
	  PST_EXTPAT, in which case we've already set extended_glob and
	  global_extglob appropriately. Only matters in compatibility mode.
