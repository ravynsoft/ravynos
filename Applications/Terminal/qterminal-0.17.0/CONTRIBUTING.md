# Code contributions

For all code contributions, please open a pull request on Github:
  https://github.com/lxde/qterminal/

Make sure your code is clean, devoid of debug statements and respects the style
of the rest of the file (including line length and indentation).

Do not pollute the git history with unnecessary commits! Make sure each of your
commits compiles to ensure ease of bisection and have clear separation of one
feature or bugfix per commit.

Please also make sure you set your `git.name` and `git.email` options properly:
